00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.386
<i>The future.</i>

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.831
<i>A dark, desolate world.</i>

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:31.009
<i>A world of
war, suffering, loss...</i>

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:33.278
<i>on both sides.</i>

00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:38.809
<i>Mutants and the humans
who dared to help them.</i>

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.441
<i>Fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat.</i>

00:02:13.302 --> 00:02:16.221
<i>Are we destined down this path?</i>

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:21.768
<i>Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?</i>

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:29.151
<i>Or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?</i>

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.153
<i>Change our fate?</i>

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:40.746
<i>Is the future truly set?</i>

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.253
They're here!

00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:18.026
Time's up.

00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:19.094
Sentinels!

00:04:23.348 --> 00:04:24.349
Sunspot!

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:30.397
Let's go.

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:16.835
Run!

00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:19.488
Go!

00:07:00.213 --> 00:07:01.965
Blink! No!

00:07:49.137 --> 00:07:50.555
Too late, assholes.

00:08:10.158 --> 00:08:11.701
Don't move, you mutant scum!

00:08:15.413 --> 00:08:16.581
No!

00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:20.226
Flat on the ground,
hands behind your head!

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.717
<i>So few of us left.</i>

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.138
<i>Professor?</i>

00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:34.683
I've found them.

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:08.109
Professor!

00:10:10.153 --> 00:10:11.362
Bobby.
Hey, Storm.

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:13.531
Hey, kid.

00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:17.076
Professor, you made it.

00:10:28.797 --> 00:10:31.758
Whenever the Sentinels attack,
Warpath spots them...

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.360
then I send Bishop
back to warn us

00:10:34.385 --> 00:10:36.137
of the attack before it happens.

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:38.807
Blink scouts the next site...

00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:41.893
and then we leave before they
ever know we were there.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.687
Because...
we never were.

00:10:44.854 --> 00:10:46.689
What do you mean
you were never there?

00:10:46.856 --> 00:10:48.541
She projects Bishop back in time

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:49.901
a few days to warn the others...

00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:51.694
of the coming attack.

00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:53.988
So she sends
Bishop back in time?

00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:56.783
No, just his consciousness,
into his younger self.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.201
His younger body.

00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:00.161
Wow.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.957
This might just work, Charles.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:06.251
What might work?

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.854
The Sentinel program
was originally

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:12.048
conceived by
Doctor Bolivar Trask.

00:11:12.382 --> 00:11:16.845
In the early '70s, he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:21.307
<i>But, covertly, he had begun
experimenting on mutants...</i>

00:11:21.474 --> 00:11:24.644
<i>using their gifts
to fuel his own research.</i>

00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.187
This is extraordinary.

00:11:26.354 --> 00:11:29.566
<i>There was one mutant who
had discovered what he was doing.</i>

00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:34.737
A mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone.

00:11:35.238 --> 00:11:36.656
Mystique.

00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:39.617
<i>I knew her as Raven.</i>

00:11:39.826 --> 00:11:41.302
We met when we were children,

00:11:41.327 --> 00:11:43.162
grew up together.

00:11:44.038 --> 00:11:45.832
She was like a sister to me.

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:47.876
I tried to help her...

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:51.588
but only succeeded
in driving her away.

00:11:52.297 --> 00:11:55.174
She hunted Trask
across the world.

00:11:55.508 --> 00:11:58.862
And at the Paris
Peace Accords in 1973,

00:11:58.887 --> 00:12:00.138
<i>after the Vietnam War...</i>

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:02.348
<i>she found Trask...</i>

00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:06.978
and killed him.

00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:14.861
<i>It was the first
time she killed.</i>

00:12:14.986 --> 00:12:16.571
It wasn't her last.

00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:20.491
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

00:12:20.617 --> 00:12:22.468
It only persuaded the government

00:12:22.493 --> 00:12:24.662
of the need for his program.

00:12:24.871 --> 00:12:27.040
They captured her that day...

00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:30.001
tortured her,
experimented on her.

00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:33.563
<i>In her DNA,
they discovered the secrets</i>

00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:35.381
<i>to her powers of transformation.</i>

00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:37.592
<i>It gave them
the key they needed...</i>

00:12:37.717 --> 00:12:41.721
<i>to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant power.</i>

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.140
<i>And in less than 50 years...</i>

00:12:44.307 --> 00:12:46.476
<i>the machines that
have destroyed...</i>

00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:50.396
<i>so many of our kind were created.</i>

00:12:50.521 --> 00:12:54.192
But it all started
that day in 1973...

00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:56.069
the day she first killed.

00:12:56.361 --> 00:12:58.279
The day she truly became...

00:12:58.404 --> 00:12:59.864
Mystique.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.242
You want to go back there.

00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:06.704
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination...

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.247
keep her out of their hands...

00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:11.834
then we can stop the Sentinels
from ever being born.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.213
And end this war
before it ever begins.

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:22.261
Uh, I can send someone
back a couple weeks.

00:13:22.887 --> 00:13:24.238
Maybe a month.

00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:27.617
But you're talking about
going back decades.

00:13:27.642 --> 00:13:30.520
You have the most powerful brain
in the world, Professor...

00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:34.899
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.486
It would rip you apart.
I'm sorry.

00:13:38.903 --> 00:13:40.822
No one could survive that trip.

00:13:41.197 --> 00:13:44.242
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

00:13:45.743 --> 00:13:48.913
What if someone can heal as
fast as they're ripped apart?

00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:15.106
Okay, spread out.

00:14:15.273 --> 00:14:17.442
Take your positions.

00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:34.100
So I wake up in my younger
body, God knows where.

00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.293
Then what?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.463
You'll need to go to
my house and find me.

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:41.274
Convince me of all of this.

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:43.109
Won't you be able
to just read my mind?

00:14:43.134 --> 00:14:46.345
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:49.323
Logan, you're going
to have to do for me

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:50.850
what I once did for you.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:53.811
Lead me, guide me.

00:14:54.145 --> 00:14:56.439
I was a very different man then.

00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:58.733
You'll have to be patient with me.

00:14:59.484 --> 00:15:01.986
Patience is my strongest suit.

00:15:02.153 --> 00:15:03.296
You'll need me as well.

00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:04.363
What?

00:15:04.489 --> 00:15:07.341
After Mystique left Charles,
she came with me...

00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:10.495
and I set her on
a dangerous path.

00:15:10.828 --> 00:15:12.180
A darker path.

00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:14.932
It's going to take the two
of us, side by side...

00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:17.668
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

00:15:21.005 --> 00:15:22.340
Great.

00:15:23.132 --> 00:15:24.842
So where do I find you?

00:15:25.176 --> 00:15:26.677
Well, it's complicated.

00:15:30.014 --> 00:15:31.824
Basically, your body
will go to sleep

00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:34.077
while your mind
travels back in time.

00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:35.262
As long as you're back there,

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:38.397
past and present will
continue to coexist.

00:15:38.856 --> 00:15:40.191
But once you wake up...

00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:44.237
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:47.507
And for the rest of us, it will
be the only history that we know.

00:15:47.532 --> 00:15:50.910
It will be like the last
50 years never happened.

00:15:51.369 --> 00:15:53.579
And this world, and this war...

00:15:53.746 --> 00:15:57.125
the only person who will
remember it is you.

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:00.061
All right, Logan...

00:16:00.086 --> 00:16:01.604
I need you to clear your head

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:03.356
and to stay as calm as possible.

00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:04.941
What? What do you mean?

00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:07.402
If your mind gets rocky, it will
be harder for me to hold you...

00:16:07.426 --> 00:16:09.862
and you could start to slip
between past and future.

00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:11.889
What if I need to
get a little rocky?

00:16:13.015 --> 00:16:14.367
Think peaceful thoughts?

00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:17.311
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:20.164
Well, you don't really age,

00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:21.589
so you'll pretty
much look the same.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.460
You won't have
much time in the past.

00:16:24.485 --> 00:16:26.087
The Sentinels will find us.

00:16:26.112 --> 00:16:27.446
They always do.

00:16:27.613 --> 00:16:29.240
And this time,
we won't be able to run.

00:16:29.407 --> 00:16:30.950
We'll have no escape.

00:16:32.243 --> 00:16:34.287
This is our last chance.

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:36.722
You really think this will work?

00:16:36.747 --> 00:16:38.583
I have faith in him.

00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:40.726
It's not him I'm
worried about, it's us.

00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:42.311
We were young...

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.921
we didn't know any better.

00:16:44.922 --> 00:16:47.425
We will now.

00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:49.802
See you all soon.

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:51.929
This might sting a little.

00:17:41.812 --> 00:17:44.523
<i>The first time</i>

00:17:47.318 --> 00:17:50.796
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

00:17:52.198 --> 00:17:53.407
Whoa.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.916
<i>I thought the sun</i>

00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:04.560
<i>Rose in your eyes</i>

00:18:14.637 --> 00:18:20.184
<i>And the moon and the stars</i>

00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:28.167
<i>Were the gifts you gave</i>

00:18:28.192 --> 00:18:29.652
Holy shit.

00:18:37.618 --> 00:18:39.328
It worked.

00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:45.184
Hey, what's going on?

00:18:45.209 --> 00:18:47.395
- Gwen, get dressed.
- Who the hell are you?

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.605
Hey, I don't know
what's going on.

00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.022
You're supposed to be

00:18:50.047 --> 00:18:51.358
guarding the boss's daughter,
not screwing her.

00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:53.259
Well, I didn't sleep with her.

00:18:53.384 --> 00:18:55.052
No?
No.

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:58.531
I mean, yes, I slept
with her many times.

00:18:58.556 --> 00:18:59.865
Jimmy!

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.451
That wasn't me.
That was the old me.

00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:05.204
I just got here 20 seconds ago.

00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:06.289
Really?

00:19:06.314 --> 00:19:07.374
Then what happened
to your clothes?

00:19:07.398 --> 00:19:08.941
My... Oh.

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:11.043
Would you believe
me if I told you

00:19:11.068 --> 00:19:12.570
I was sent here from the future?

00:19:12.695 --> 00:19:14.130
Huh?

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:16.924
Get out of here, sweetheart.
Yeah.

00:19:16.949 --> 00:19:18.885
- We're gonna take care of this comedian.
- No, you're not.

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:21.221
You're gonna give me the keys to
your car and some money for gas...

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:22.472
or you're gonna wake
up in the hospital.

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.290
Trust me, I know how
these things play out.

00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:26.058
Oh. Because you're
from the future?

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:27.126
No.

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:28.919
Because of these.

00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:32.715
What the hell?

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.180
God damn it!

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:01.118
Peaceful thoughts.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:19.528
We are reviewing
all of our defense expenditures...

00:20:19.553 --> 00:20:21.597
and all the black books
are being opened.

00:20:21.764 --> 00:20:25.684
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:27.478
If these mutants,
as you describe...

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.980
are already living among us...

00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:31.982
then they are living
here peacefully.

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:33.794
We haven't had an
incident in over 10 years.

00:20:33.818 --> 00:20:35.152
After what happened in Cuba?

00:20:35.277 --> 00:20:36.612
That was never confirmed.

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:38.989
We have very real
enemies out there...

00:20:39.156 --> 00:20:40.549
the Russians, the Chinese.

00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:43.661
We are talking about
a tenth of a tenth...

00:20:43.828 --> 00:20:45.871
of a tenth of our population.

00:20:46.038 --> 00:20:48.432
Allow me to read
something to you.

00:20:48.457 --> 00:20:49.642
Please.

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:52.545
This was acquired by
our friends at the CIA.

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:54.021
It's a dissertation...

00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:57.800
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

00:20:58.592 --> 00:20:59.969
And I quote...

00:21:00.428 --> 00:21:02.304
"To Homo Neanderthalensis..."

00:21:02.471 --> 00:21:04.682
"his mutant cousin,
Homo Sapiens..."

00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:06.475
"which is us..."

00:21:06.642 --> 00:21:08.644
"was an aberration."

00:21:08.811 --> 00:21:11.939
"The arrival of the mutated
human species, Homo Sapiens..."

00:21:12.106 --> 00:21:16.444
"was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kin."

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:18.070
Well...

00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:23.075
Now, we are the Neanderthal.

00:21:23.242 --> 00:21:25.052
Speak for yourself,
Dr. Trask.

00:21:27.163 --> 00:21:29.874
You know, when you sent our
soldiers to Vietnam...

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.810
without the weapons they
needed to win the war...

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:33.752
you underestimated your enemy.

00:21:33.878 --> 00:21:37.273
You do that with this enemy...

00:21:37.298 --> 00:21:38.524
Mmm...

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:41.552
and it won't be some border
skirmish halfway around the world.

00:21:41.719 --> 00:21:43.888
This time, the war will
be for our streets...

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:46.265
our cities, our homes...

00:21:46.432 --> 00:21:50.478
and by the time you see the
need for my program...

00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:52.938
it will be too late...

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:57.735
and you will have lost
two wars in one lifetime.

00:22:00.654 --> 00:22:02.781
We are sorry,
Dr. Trask...

00:22:03.199 --> 00:22:05.534
but your Sentinel Program...

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.162
it ain't gonna fly.

00:22:20.758 --> 00:22:21.984
Can I help you, Colonel?

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:24.303
Just here to give our
boys a proper send-off.

00:22:24.428 --> 00:22:27.765
I'm sorry, sir, but we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

00:22:27.932 --> 00:22:29.934
Stand aside, soldier.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.977
That's an order.

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.112
Atten-hut!

00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:44.198
At ease.

00:23:07.638 --> 00:23:08.948
What is all this?

00:23:08.973 --> 00:23:10.558
Lab reports, blood tests.

00:23:10.975 --> 00:23:12.452
It's all getting packed up
and shipped back.

00:23:12.476 --> 00:23:13.661
Where is it going?

00:23:13.686 --> 00:23:14.728
Same place they are.

00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:16.814
Trask Industries.

00:23:18.357 --> 00:23:20.000
Let's go, gentlemen.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:22.319
I'm taking you out
of this shit show.

00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:24.321
Shipping home?

00:23:25.364 --> 00:23:26.532
Not just yet.

00:23:27.241 --> 00:23:28.801
What are you doing with those?

00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:30.619
Something to make the ride
a little smoother.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:33.205
I'm transferring you
to a private facility...

00:23:33.831 --> 00:23:35.708
where we can run
a few more tests.

00:23:41.338 --> 00:23:42.756
Your men are not military.

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:45.092
Private outfit.

00:23:45.551 --> 00:23:47.052
We're authorized
to remand these men.

00:23:47.261 --> 00:23:48.262
Hmm.

00:23:51.682 --> 00:23:53.434
These troops are going home.

00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:57.605
Well, Colonel, I don't believe you
have jurisdiction in this matter.

00:23:58.522 --> 00:24:00.858
I'm afraid I do, son.

00:24:01.025 --> 00:24:02.151
I'm sorry, who are you?

00:24:02.776 --> 00:24:04.445
The question is, Major...

00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:09.700
who are you?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.205
Raven!

00:24:56.622 --> 00:24:57.998
That's not my name.

00:25:03.587 --> 00:25:05.589
I had that.

00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:06.840
I know.

00:25:08.676 --> 00:25:10.636
Let's move out.
Come on, let's go.

00:25:10.803 --> 00:25:11.970
Where's Erik?

00:25:12.137 --> 00:25:13.222
I'm on my own now.

00:25:16.684 --> 00:25:17.976
Let's go! Move it!

00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:38.288
Hold that plane!

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:41.625
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

00:25:41.792 --> 00:25:42.793
Yes, sir.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.337
You're not coming
with us, are you?

00:25:45.796 --> 00:25:47.172
My war's not over.

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:48.882
The enemy is still out there.

00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:14.074
The four privates,
where did they go?

00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:16.076
They were headed
towards the tarmac.

00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:16.220
Can I help you?

00:27:16.637 --> 00:27:19.097
Uh... Yeah, what
happened to the school?

00:27:19.264 --> 00:27:22.284
The school's been shut for years.
Are you a parent?

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:25.020
I sure as hell
hope not. Who are you?

00:27:25.229 --> 00:27:27.231
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy.

00:27:27.356 --> 00:27:29.399
I look after the house now.

00:27:30.192 --> 00:27:31.502
You're Beast?

00:27:31.527 --> 00:27:33.946
Look at you. I guess
you're a late bloomer.

00:27:34.071 --> 00:27:35.256
I don't know what
you're talking about,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.865
but I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:38.759
So where's the Professor?

00:27:38.784 --> 00:27:40.093
There's no professor here.

00:27:40.118 --> 00:27:42.246
You're pretty strong
for a scrawny kid.

00:27:42.412 --> 00:27:44.765
You sure there's not
a little Beast in there?

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.558
No, he's not here.
Come on, Beast.

00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.043
Come on, Beastie.
No.

00:27:48.252 --> 00:27:49.878
Hey!

00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:52.631
I said the school's closed.

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:54.758
You need to leave. Not
until I see the Professor.

00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:57.386
There's no professor here,
I told you that.

00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:01.056
Look, kid. You and I are
gonna be good friends.

00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:05.269
You just don't know it yet.

00:28:07.813 --> 00:28:09.314
Professor!

00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:16.655
Professor!

00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:33.338
Hank?

00:28:33.505 --> 00:28:35.299
What's going on here?

00:28:36.633 --> 00:28:37.860
Professor?

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:39.177
Please don't call me that.

00:28:39.303 --> 00:28:40.804
Why?
You know this guy?

00:28:40.971 --> 00:28:43.323
Yeah, he looks
slightly familiar.

00:28:43.348 --> 00:28:45.617
Get off the bloody
chandelier, Hank.

00:28:47.436 --> 00:28:48.770
You can walk.

00:28:48.937 --> 00:28:50.147
You're a perceptive one.

00:28:50.272 --> 00:28:51.815
I thought Erik...

00:28:51.982 --> 00:28:53.167
Which makes it
slightly perplexing that

00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:55.127
you missed our
sign on the way in.

00:28:55.152 --> 00:28:56.462
This is private property,
my friend.

00:28:56.486 --> 00:28:58.614
I'm gonna have to ask him
to ask you to leave.

00:28:58.739 --> 00:29:00.215
Well.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.159
I'm afraid I can't do that...

00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:06.163
because I was sent here for you.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.291
Well, tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

00:29:10.208 --> 00:29:11.528
That's gonna be
a little tricky...

00:29:12.002 --> 00:29:15.339
because the person
who sent me was you.

00:29:15.505 --> 00:29:16.565
What?

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.258
About 50 years from now.

00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:19.905
Like in the future,
50 years from now?

00:29:19.927 --> 00:29:20.986
Yeah.

00:29:21.011 --> 00:29:22.930
I sent you from the future?
Yeah.

00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:24.640
Piss off.

00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:28.435
If you had your powers, you'd
know I was telling the truth.

00:29:28.602 --> 00:29:31.229
How do you know
I don't have my p...

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.123
- Who are you?
- I told you.

00:29:33.148 --> 00:29:34.666
Are you CIA?
No.

00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:35.692
You've been watching me?

00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:37.544
I know you, Charles.

00:29:37.569 --> 00:29:39.571
We've been friends for years.

00:29:39.947 --> 00:29:41.698
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

00:29:42.532 --> 00:29:44.719
I know you thought you were
going crazy when it started...

00:29:44.743 --> 00:29:46.845
all the voices in your head.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.472
And it wasn't
until you were 12...

00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:52.000
that you realized all the voices
were in everyone else's head.

00:29:52.167 --> 00:29:54.378
Do you want me to go on?

00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:57.105
I never told anyone that.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.759
Not yet, no, but, you will.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.487
All right,
you've piqued my interest.

00:30:03.512 --> 00:30:05.097
What do you want?

00:30:05.263 --> 00:30:07.349
We have to stop Raven.

00:30:09.685 --> 00:30:11.603
I need your help.

00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:14.523
We need your help.

00:30:18.735 --> 00:30:20.821
I think I'd like to wake up now.

00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:27.995
What does she
have to do with this?

00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.934
<i>So you're saying...</i>

00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:36.169
they took Raven's
power, and what?

00:30:36.503 --> 00:30:38.714
They weaponized it?

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.881
Yep.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.092
She is unique.

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:44.177
Yeah, she is, Hank.

00:30:44.344 --> 00:30:47.322
In the beginning, the Sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:50.225
Then they began to identify the
genetics in non-mutants...

00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:54.980
who would eventually have mutant
children and grandchildren.

00:30:55.522 --> 00:30:58.525
Many of the humans tried to help
us, but it was a slaughter.

00:30:58.942 --> 00:31:01.695
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge.

00:31:01.862 --> 00:31:03.822
I've been in a lot of wars.

00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:07.826
I'd never seen
anything like this.

00:31:08.618 --> 00:31:10.178
And it all starts with her.

00:31:10.203 --> 00:31:12.664
Let's just say
for the sake of...

00:31:13.665 --> 00:31:16.418
the sake, that I
choose to believe you...

00:31:16.585 --> 00:31:19.629
that I choose to help you.
Raven won't listen to me.

00:31:21.798 --> 00:31:25.719
Her heart and soul
belong to someone else now.

00:31:26.136 --> 00:31:27.220
I know.

00:31:29.097 --> 00:31:31.725
That's why we're
gonna need Magneto, too.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.102
Erik?

00:31:34.644 --> 00:31:36.063
You do know where he is?
Yeah.

00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:43.862
He's where he belongs.

00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:46.506
You're just gonna walk out?

00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:49.176
Ooh, top marks. Like I
said, you are perceptive.

00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:51.121
The Professor I know would
never turn his back...

00:31:51.244 --> 00:31:53.163
on someone who'd
lost their path.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.332
Especially someone he loved.

00:31:57.751 --> 00:31:59.086
You know...

00:31:59.252 --> 00:32:01.379
I think I do remember you now.

00:32:01.546 --> 00:32:03.815
Yeah. We came to
you a long time ago...

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.967
seeking your help.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.971
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

00:32:11.723 --> 00:32:12.933
Fuck off.

00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:14.726
Listen to me, you little shit.

00:32:15.227 --> 00:32:18.355
I've come a long way, and I've
watched a lot of people die.

00:32:18.522 --> 00:32:20.190
Good people. Friends.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.834
If you're gonna
wallow in self-pity...

00:32:21.858 --> 00:32:23.753
and do nothing, then you're
gonna watch the same thing...

00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:25.445
you understand?

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.202
We all have to die sometime.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.917
Told you there was
no professor here.

00:32:41.169 --> 00:32:43.004
What the hell happened to him?

00:32:46.925 --> 00:32:48.927
<i>He lost everything.</i>

00:32:49.094 --> 00:32:51.513
<i>Erik, Raven...</i>

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.473
<i>his legs.</i>

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.518
<i>We built the school,
the labs, this whole place...</i>

00:32:56.726 --> 00:33:00.438
then, just after
the first semester...

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:02.190
the war in Vietnam got worse.

00:33:03.275 --> 00:33:04.776
Many of the teachers...

00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:07.779
and older students were drafted.

00:33:08.155 --> 00:33:09.489
It broke him.

00:33:09.948 --> 00:33:12.284
<i>He retreated into himself.</i>

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.703
<i>I wanted to help,
do something...</i>

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.913
<i>so I designed a serum
to treat his spine...</i>

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.126
<i>derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation.</i>

00:33:22.377 --> 00:33:25.088
I take just enough
to keep myself balanced...

00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:28.216
but he takes too much.

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:30.635
I tried easing him back...

00:33:30.802 --> 00:33:34.306
but he just couldn't bear
the pain, the voices.

00:33:34.472 --> 00:33:36.933
The treatment
gives him his legs...

00:33:37.684 --> 00:33:39.603
but it's not enough.

00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:40.812
He's...

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.108
He's just lost too much.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.956
<i>You're not scared of me?</i>

00:34:00.832 --> 00:34:04.044
<i>I always believed I
couldn't be the only one in the world.</i>

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.087
<i>Charles Xavier.</i>

00:34:08.798 --> 00:34:09.966
Raven.

00:34:11.343 --> 00:34:13.053
You're hungry and alone.

00:34:13.428 --> 00:34:14.946
Take whatever you want.

00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:17.891
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

00:34:18.892 --> 00:34:20.101
In fact...

00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:22.771
<i>you never have to steal again.</i>

00:34:23.104 --> 00:34:25.106
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

00:34:30.654 --> 00:34:32.697
I'll help you get her.

00:34:34.282 --> 00:34:37.577
Not for any of your future
shite, but for her.

00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:38.912
Fair enough.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.207
But I'll tell you this.
You don't know Erik.

00:34:42.415 --> 00:34:45.001
That man is a monster.
A murderer.

00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:47.938
You think you can
convince Raven to change?

00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:49.089
To come home?

00:34:49.506 --> 00:34:50.924
That's splendid.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.344
But what makes you think
you can change him?

00:34:54.511 --> 00:34:58.098
Because you and Erik sent
me back here together.

00:35:00.934 --> 00:35:02.494
<i>The room they're holding him in</i>

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:03.955
<i>was built during
the Second World War...</i>

00:35:03.979 --> 00:35:05.580
<i>when there was
a shortage of steel.</i>

00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:09.442
<i>So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand. No metal.</i>

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:10.694
He's being held...

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.071
a hundred floors
beneath the most

00:35:13.196 --> 00:35:15.448
heavily guarded
building on the planet.

00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:16.992
Why is he in there?

00:35:18.702 --> 00:35:19.953
What, he forgot to mention?

00:35:22.122 --> 00:35:23.164
Uh, JFK.

00:35:23.581 --> 00:35:24.683
He killed...

00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:29.629
What else explains a bullet
miraculously curving through the air?

00:35:29.796 --> 00:35:31.423
Erik's always had
a way with guns.

00:35:31.548 --> 00:35:33.275
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.734
This is your plan, not mine.

00:35:34.759 --> 00:35:36.903
We don't have any
resources to get us in.

00:35:36.928 --> 00:35:38.596
Or out.

00:35:39.222 --> 00:35:40.849
It's just me and Hank.

00:35:41.016 --> 00:35:42.350
I knew a guy.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:43.977
Yeah, he'd be a young man now.

00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:47.397
Grew up outside of D.C.

00:35:47.522 --> 00:35:49.107
He could get into anywhere.

00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:51.818
I just don't know how the hell
we're gonna find him.

00:35:53.153 --> 00:35:55.822
Is Cerebro out of the question?

00:35:58.408 --> 00:36:00.618
We have a phonebook.

00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:09.252
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip, sir.

00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:11.296
I just came to
grab a couple files.

00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:14.883
Is that a new scarf?
It's nice.

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.134
Thank you.

00:37:47.434 --> 00:37:48.743
Dr. Trask?

00:37:48.768 --> 00:37:49.853
One second.

00:37:50.937 --> 00:37:52.163
Oh.

00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:54.691
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

00:37:58.194 --> 00:37:59.446
Thank you.

00:38:00.613 --> 00:38:01.948
Is something wrong, sir?

00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:05.034
No. It's nothing.

00:38:05.368 --> 00:38:07.954
Would you mind
typing up my itinerary?

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.123
I don't wanna miss anything.

00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:19.983
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

00:38:20.008 --> 00:38:21.448
Just stop here.
All right, all right.

00:38:21.593 --> 00:38:23.720
Next time I'm driving.
Don't get used to it.

00:38:41.404 --> 00:38:43.256
What's he done now?

00:38:43.281 --> 00:38:45.176
I will just write you a
check for whatever he took.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.451
We just need to talk to him.

00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:53.391
Peter! The cops
are here. Again.

00:39:00.381 --> 00:39:01.501
What do you guys want?

00:39:01.633 --> 00:39:04.302
I didn't do anything.
I've been here all day.

00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:07.388
Just relax, Peter.
We're not cops.

00:39:07.555 --> 00:39:08.657
Of course you're not.
If you were,

00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:09.909
you wouldn't be
driving a rental car.

00:39:09.933 --> 00:39:11.035
How did you know
we've got a rental car?

00:39:11.059 --> 00:39:13.037
I checked your registration when
you were walking to the door.

00:39:13.061 --> 00:39:14.079
I also had some time to kill

00:39:14.103 --> 00:39:15.247
so I went through
your rental agreement.

00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:17.357
Saw you were from out of town.
Are you FBI?

00:39:18.316 --> 00:39:20.586
No, you're not cops. Hey, what's
with this gifted youngsters place?

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.946
That's an old card.

00:39:24.197 --> 00:39:26.199
He's fascinating.
He's a pain in the arse.

00:39:26.366 --> 00:39:27.534
What, a teleporter?

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.785
No, he's just fast.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.329
And when I knew him
he wasn't so... young.

00:39:32.163 --> 00:39:33.998
Young?
You're just old.

00:39:34.999 --> 00:39:36.876
So you're not afraid
to show your powers?

00:39:37.043 --> 00:39:38.603
What powers? What
are you talking about?

00:39:39.379 --> 00:39:40.838
Do you see
something strange here?

00:39:42.006 --> 00:39:44.133
Nothing anybody would
believe if you told them.

00:39:48.263 --> 00:39:49.864
So, who are you?
What do you want?

00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:51.558
We need your help, Peter.
For what?

00:39:51.724 --> 00:39:53.768
To break into a highly
secured facility...

00:39:54.185 --> 00:39:55.478
and to get someone out.

00:39:55.645 --> 00:39:56.688
Prison break?

00:39:57.355 --> 00:39:58.523
That's illegal, you know.

00:39:58.815 --> 00:39:59.816
Um...

00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.737
Well, only if you get caught.

00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.005
So, what's in it for me?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.409
You, you kleptomaniac, get
to break into the Pentagon.

00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:17.000
How do I know I can trust you?

00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:19.502
Because we're just like you.

00:40:21.796 --> 00:40:23.006
Show him.

00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:36.853
That's cool,
but it's disgusting.

00:40:38.688 --> 00:40:43.484
Built in 1943, the Pentagon
is the world's largest office building...

00:40:43.651 --> 00:40:46.529
housing more than
25,000 military employees...

00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.339
stretched over six
million square feet.

00:40:48.364 --> 00:40:49.365
Where's the bathroom?

00:40:49.866 --> 00:40:52.285
He always needs to pee!

00:41:55.264 --> 00:41:57.576
Yeah, we're getting broadcast
signal down here. What's going on?

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.435
Damn it, call Maintenance,
get them down here.

00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:40.161
Fought for and captured the island
of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire.

00:43:40.828 --> 00:43:42.205
Now, this month-long battle...

00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:43.915
included some of
the fiercest fighting

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.583
during World War
II in the Pacific...

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:03.726
In three seconds, those
doors are going to open...

00:44:03.893 --> 00:44:06.229
and 20 guards will
be here to shoot us.

00:44:07.271 --> 00:44:09.123
I know. That's what
I'm waiting for.

00:44:09.148 --> 00:44:10.291
What are you doing?

00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:12.044
I'm holding your neck so
you don't get whiplash.

00:44:12.068 --> 00:44:13.069
What?

00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:15.404
Whiplash.

00:44:19.909 --> 00:44:21.244
Don't move!

00:44:36.259 --> 00:44:37.568
You're good, it'll pass.

00:44:37.593 --> 00:44:38.761
It happens with everyone.

00:44:41.264 --> 00:44:43.432
You must have done
something pretty serious.

00:44:43.558 --> 00:44:45.034
What did you do, man?

00:44:45.059 --> 00:44:46.619
What did you do?

00:44:46.644 --> 00:44:48.413
What did you do? Why'd
they have you in there?

00:44:48.437 --> 00:44:50.231
For killing the President.

00:44:51.023 --> 00:44:54.193
Ah. Wow.
Shit.

00:44:54.986 --> 00:44:56.712
The only thing I'm guilty of

00:44:56.737 --> 00:44:58.322
is fighting for people like us.

00:44:58.489 --> 00:45:00.424
You take karate?
You know karate, man?

00:45:00.449 --> 00:45:02.577
I don't know karate.

00:45:02.743 --> 00:45:04.053
But I know crazy.

00:45:05.162 --> 00:45:08.057
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, this is a Code Red situation.

00:45:08.082 --> 00:45:10.142
We are evacuating
the entire floor...

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:12.937
so that my associate and I...

00:45:12.962 --> 00:45:14.647
can, uh, secure the prison.

00:45:14.672 --> 00:45:16.173
Who are you?

00:45:16.299 --> 00:45:17.842
We're special operations, CB...

00:45:17.967 --> 00:45:19.318
FB-CID.

00:45:19.343 --> 00:45:22.238
Perhaps you didn't hear me
when first I spoke...

00:45:22.263 --> 00:45:24.156
but it is imperative
that you understand...

00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:25.783
we're in a complete
lockdown situation.

00:45:25.808 --> 00:45:27.535
We have to get you
to the third floor...

00:45:34.525 --> 00:45:36.569
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you finished?

00:45:41.782 --> 00:45:43.659
They told me you control metal.

00:45:44.035 --> 00:45:45.244
"They"?

00:45:48.205 --> 00:45:51.417
You know, my mom once knew
a guy who could do that.

00:45:54.003 --> 00:45:56.923
I'm sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.302
Charles?

00:46:08.017 --> 00:46:09.936
Good to see you too, old friend.

00:46:10.102 --> 00:46:11.228
And walking.

00:46:11.354 --> 00:46:12.813
No thanks to you.

00:46:14.273 --> 00:46:16.734
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:18.194
Believe me...

00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:20.029
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to.

00:46:20.363 --> 00:46:22.365
If we get you out of here,
we do it my way.

00:46:22.531 --> 00:46:23.532
No killing.

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:24.951
No helmet.

00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:27.536
I couldn't disobey
you even if I wanted.

00:46:27.703 --> 00:46:30.247
I'm never getting
inside of that head again.

00:46:31.582 --> 00:46:33.542
I need your word, Erik.

00:46:36.754 --> 00:46:37.880
Nobody move!

00:46:38.381 --> 00:46:40.383
Hold it right there!

00:46:42.426 --> 00:46:44.095
- Charles.
- Don't move.

00:46:44.261 --> 00:46:46.263
Hands up, or we will shoot!

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.115
Freeze them, Charles.
I can't.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.433
Hands up!

00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:55.189
No!

00:47:08.077 --> 00:47:12.289
<i>If I could save time in a bottle</i>

00:47:13.582 --> 00:47:18.521
<i>The first thing
that I'd like to do</i>

00:47:18.546 --> 00:47:21.232
<i>Is to save every day</i>

00:47:21.257 --> 00:47:25.111
<i>Till eternity passes away</i>

00:47:25.136 --> 00:47:28.097
<i>Just to spend them with you</i>

00:47:29.348 --> 00:47:33.602
<i>If I could make days
last forever</i>

00:47:34.687 --> 00:47:38.274
<i>If words could make
wishes come true</i>

00:47:39.859 --> 00:47:42.503
<i>I'd save every day</i>

00:47:42.528 --> 00:47:45.423
<i>Like a treasure and then</i>

00:47:45.448 --> 00:47:49.827
<i>Again,
I would spend them with you</i>

00:47:50.536 --> 00:47:53.723
<i>But there never seems
to be enough time</i>

00:47:53.748 --> 00:47:56.225
<i>To do the things you want to do</i>

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.919
<i>Once you find them</i>

00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:04.191
<i>I've looked around
enough to know</i>

00:48:04.216 --> 00:48:08.929
<i>That you're the one I want
to go through time with</i>

00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:50.012
Thanks, kid.

00:48:54.683 --> 00:48:56.727
Peter,
thank you very, very much.

00:48:56.894 --> 00:48:57.895
You take care.

00:48:58.062 --> 00:48:59.372
Hey, I saw your
flight plan in the cockpit.

00:48:59.396 --> 00:49:00.476
Why are you going to Paris?

00:49:12.034 --> 00:49:13.786
Imagine if they were metal.

00:49:15.204 --> 00:49:17.014
Do me a favor and return it for me.
Okay.

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.374
And, Peter?

00:49:18.874 --> 00:49:20.184
Take it slow.

00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:23.129
Where did they dig you up?

00:49:24.421 --> 00:49:26.715
You're gonna find
this hard to believe...

00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:29.718
but, uh, you sent me.

00:49:29.885 --> 00:49:32.054
You and Charles.

00:49:32.221 --> 00:49:33.806
From the future.

00:49:56.245 --> 00:49:58.414
How did you lose them?

00:49:58.581 --> 00:50:00.833
The treatment for my
spine affects my DNA.

00:50:03.669 --> 00:50:06.172
You sacrificed your powers
so you could walk?

00:50:07.006 --> 00:50:10.176
I sacrificed my powers
so that I could sleep.

00:50:12.636 --> 00:50:13.762
What do you know about it?

00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:15.239
I've lost my fair share.

00:50:15.264 --> 00:50:16.265
Ha.

00:50:16.682 --> 00:50:18.434
Dry your eyes, Erik.

00:50:18.601 --> 00:50:20.269
It doesn't justify
what you've done.

00:50:20.436 --> 00:50:22.104
You have no idea what I've done.

00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:24.249
I know that you took the things
that mean the most to me.

00:50:24.273 --> 00:50:26.584
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

00:50:26.609 --> 00:50:27.960
If you want a fight, Erik...

00:50:27.985 --> 00:50:29.587
Sit down.
I will give you a fight!

00:50:29.612 --> 00:50:30.796
Let him come.

00:50:30.821 --> 00:50:32.631
You abandoned me!

00:50:32.656 --> 00:50:33.924
You took her away...

00:50:33.949 --> 00:50:35.034
and you abandoned me!

00:50:35.201 --> 00:50:36.619
Angel.

00:50:36.952 --> 00:50:38.287
Azazel.

00:50:38.954 --> 00:50:40.789
Emma.

00:50:40.956 --> 00:50:42.333
Banshee.

00:50:43.292 --> 00:50:44.960
Mutant brothers and sisters...

00:50:45.127 --> 00:50:46.587
all dead!

00:50:48.839 --> 00:50:50.608
Countless others...

00:50:50.633 --> 00:50:51.734
experimented on.

00:50:51.759 --> 00:50:52.860
Butchered!

00:50:52.885 --> 00:50:53.944
Erik!

00:50:53.969 --> 00:50:55.095
Where were you, Charles?

00:50:55.471 --> 00:50:57.765
We were supposed
to protect them!

00:50:58.307 --> 00:51:00.643
Where were you when your
own people needed you?

00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:02.895
Hiding! You and Hank!

00:51:03.312 --> 00:51:05.064
Pretending to be
something you're not!

00:51:05.648 --> 00:51:07.024
Erik!

00:51:08.859 --> 00:51:11.403
You abandoned us all.

00:51:31.548 --> 00:51:33.759
So, you were always an asshole.

00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:38.948
I take it we're best
buddies in the future.

00:51:40.516 --> 00:51:41.951
I spent a lot of years

00:51:41.976 --> 00:51:43.686
trying to bring you down, bub.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.021
How does that work out for you?

00:51:46.188 --> 00:51:47.898
You're like me.

00:51:49.066 --> 00:51:50.818
You're a survivor.

00:51:54.905 --> 00:51:56.265
Do you wanna pick
all that shit up?

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:19.596
General, maybe you should slow down,
we have a big day tomorrow.

00:52:20.556 --> 00:52:26.270
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you
win a war, let alone against the American devils.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.107
I'm getting another bottle.

00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:48.267
Excuse me.

00:52:49.418 --> 00:52:51.378
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

00:52:51.754 --> 00:52:53.172
You speak Vietnamese.

00:52:53.422 --> 00:52:54.506
I'm an interpreter.

00:52:56.508 --> 00:52:59.011
I speak many tongues.

00:52:59.762 --> 00:53:01.930
Let me buy you another drink...

00:53:02.264 --> 00:53:04.350
unless you're here with someone.

00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:07.394
I'm alone.

00:53:08.645 --> 00:53:10.939
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please.

00:53:25.704 --> 00:53:28.374
You're going to the Summit tomorrow?

00:53:33.462 --> 00:53:38.525
A pretty girl interested in politics...

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.136
Looks can be deceiving.

00:53:41.553 --> 00:53:43.013
Lady.

00:53:43.806 --> 00:53:47.017
Show me more, baby?

00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:51.397
Clothes off?

00:54:03.867 --> 00:54:07.871
What's the matter, baby? You don't
think I look pretty like this?

00:54:54.418 --> 00:54:57.212
Fancy a game?
It's been a while.

00:54:57.379 --> 00:54:59.047
I'm not in the mood
for games, thank you.

00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:08.849
I haven't had
a real sip in ten years.

00:55:21.653 --> 00:55:22.988
I didn't kill the President.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.074
The bullet curved, Erik.

00:55:26.241 --> 00:55:27.743
Because I was
trying to save him.

00:55:29.286 --> 00:55:30.829
They took me out before I could.

00:55:30.996 --> 00:55:32.098
Why would you try and save him?

00:55:32.122 --> 00:55:34.750
Because he was one of us.

00:55:45.928 --> 00:55:48.347
You must think me so foolish.

00:55:49.932 --> 00:55:51.934
We've always said they
would come after us.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.437
I never imagined they'd
use Raven's DNA to do it.

00:55:56.313 --> 00:55:57.606
When did you last see her?

00:56:01.276 --> 00:56:03.153
The day I left for Dallas.

00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:05.447
And how was she?

00:56:07.449 --> 00:56:08.450
Strong.

00:56:09.326 --> 00:56:10.327
Driven.

00:56:11.495 --> 00:56:12.596
Loyal.

00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:15.374
How... How was she?

00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:18.293
She was...

00:56:20.045 --> 00:56:21.797
We were...

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.636
I could see why she
meant so much to you.

00:56:30.222 --> 00:56:31.890
You should be proud
of her, Charles.

00:56:33.475 --> 00:56:35.352
She's out there
fighting for our cause.

00:56:35.519 --> 00:56:36.895
Your cause.

00:56:37.688 --> 00:56:40.482
The girl I raised was
not capable of killing.

00:56:40.649 --> 00:56:42.293
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

00:56:42.317 --> 00:56:44.504
She couldn't stay a little girl
forever, that's why she left.

00:56:44.528 --> 00:56:47.406
She left because you
got inside her head.

00:56:49.408 --> 00:56:51.326
That's not my power.

00:56:53.328 --> 00:56:54.663
She made a choice.

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:57.666
But now we know where
that choice leads, don't we?

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.309
She's going to murder Trask,

00:56:59.334 --> 00:57:00.574
they're going to capture her...

00:57:01.169 --> 00:57:03.422
and then they're
going to wipe us out.

00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:05.507
Not if we get to her first.

00:57:06.717 --> 00:57:08.927
Not if we change
history tomorrow.

00:57:14.433 --> 00:57:16.101
I'm sorry, Charles...

00:57:20.522 --> 00:57:21.523
for what happened.

00:57:22.357 --> 00:57:23.692
I truly am.

00:57:27.779 --> 00:57:29.819
It's been a while since I've played.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.577
I'll go easy on you.

00:57:35.454 --> 00:57:37.372
Might finally be a fair fight.

00:57:38.707 --> 00:57:40.083
You have the first move.

00:57:54.222 --> 00:57:56.992
<i>The diplomats from
all around the world</i>

00:57:57.017 --> 00:57:59.061
<i>are arriving here
today at the Hotel Royal.</i>

00:57:59.227 --> 00:58:00.646
<i>It's an historic day.</i>

00:58:00.812 --> 00:58:03.123
<i>It's the, uh, official ending</i>

00:58:03.148 --> 00:58:05.901
<i>of the United States' military
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:08.236
<i>There we have the South
Vietnamese Foreign Minister...</i>

00:58:08.403 --> 00:58:10.072
<i>with other South
Vietnamese dignitaries.</i>

00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:13.241
The Summit doesn't begin
for another hour.

00:58:13.408 --> 00:58:15.010
The hotel has arranged
a private room

00:58:15.035 --> 00:58:16.578
upstairs for
your special guests.

00:58:16.745 --> 00:58:18.764
That will be plenty of time.

00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:26.797
Good afternoon, everyone.
Hello, thank you for coming.

00:58:26.963 --> 00:58:29.591
Congratulations on
winning this war.

00:58:30.092 --> 00:58:32.277
Now, I know you all
have hands to shake

00:58:32.302 --> 00:58:34.429
and photos to take downstairs...

00:58:34.596 --> 00:58:36.640
so I will get
right to the point.

00:58:37.432 --> 00:58:39.685
There is a new enemy out there.

00:58:39.851 --> 00:58:42.354
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless...

00:58:42.521 --> 00:58:43.814
your armies powerless...

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.857
and your nations defenseless.

00:58:51.613 --> 00:58:55.492
<i>You will need a new weapon for
this war. I call them Sentinels.</i>

00:58:57.327 --> 00:58:59.304
Named after
the ancient guardians

00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:01.206
that stood at
the gates of the citadel.

00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:06.294
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a Harrier jet.

00:59:07.295 --> 00:59:09.631
Armed with guns
that can fire off...

00:59:09.798 --> 00:59:13.802
<i>more than 2,000 rounds per minute
of thermoceramic ammunition.</i>

00:59:13.969 --> 00:59:16.471
But size, power, speed...

00:59:16.638 --> 00:59:18.557
you could find that
at Lockheed or Boeing.

00:59:18.724 --> 00:59:21.226
No, what makes the
Sentinels so special...

00:59:21.393 --> 00:59:24.855
is the ability to target
the mutant X-gene.

00:59:25.021 --> 00:59:26.523
A genetic guidance system

00:59:26.648 --> 00:59:29.192
that can lock onto a mark a half a
mile away.

00:59:29.359 --> 00:59:32.362
It won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

00:59:32.529 --> 00:59:34.423
With this weapon, there will be

00:59:34.448 --> 00:59:36.074
no human collateral damage.

00:59:36.241 --> 00:59:39.077
If I turn it on, the system
couldn't even activate in here.

00:59:46.835 --> 00:59:50.672
Unless there's a mutant.

00:59:59.222 --> 01:00:01.933
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.229
My machines don't make mistakes.

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.130
What are you?

01:00:11.026 --> 01:00:12.778
I assure you...

01:00:14.863 --> 01:00:15.903
No, don't shoot it.

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:17.841
I assure you,

01:00:17.866 --> 01:00:19.426
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:00:53.819 --> 01:00:54.861
Raven!

01:01:00.283 --> 01:01:02.160
Raven? Raven!

01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:07.641
Raven?

01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:10.919
Charles?

01:01:11.086 --> 01:01:13.338
We've come for you, Erik and I.

01:01:13.505 --> 01:01:14.506
Together.

01:01:15.507 --> 01:01:17.676
I never thought
I'd see you again.

01:01:17.843 --> 01:01:20.153
I made you
a promise a long time ago

01:01:20.178 --> 01:01:21.304
that I would protect you.

01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:30.105
<i>Wolverine!</i>

01:01:34.317 --> 01:01:35.527
I'm going to keep you safe.

01:01:35.694 --> 01:01:37.320
I'm going to keep you
out of their hands.

01:01:41.283 --> 01:01:42.617
Erik?

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:45.954
Erik?
What are you doing?

01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:49.165
Securing our future.

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.293
Forgive me, Mystique.

01:01:51.668 --> 01:01:54.129
As long as you're out
there, we'll never be safe.

01:01:55.297 --> 01:01:56.481
Erik...

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.508
Use your power,
Charles. Stop him.

01:01:58.675 --> 01:01:59.801
He can't.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:32.167
He's slipping back.

01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:33.543
I'm losing him.

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.252
<i>Stryker!</i>

01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.897
<i>Someone will finish
what we've started, Wolverine!</i>

01:03:18.922 --> 01:03:20.023
<i>One day!</i>

01:03:25.428 --> 01:03:26.429
Restrain him.

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:42.570
Erik!

01:03:52.747 --> 01:03:53.890
Where am I?

01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:54.958
Huh?

01:03:56.793 --> 01:03:58.086
How the hell did I get here?

01:03:58.253 --> 01:03:59.838
What? You came to us.

01:04:00.839 --> 01:04:02.090
Who are you?
Charles.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:03.817
Charles Xavier!

01:04:03.842 --> 01:04:04.901
I don't know you.

01:04:04.926 --> 01:04:06.970
Huh?
What the hell is that?

01:04:07.095 --> 01:04:10.473
Whoa.Whoa. Look, I can deal with this.
Just go.

01:04:10.765 --> 01:04:12.142
Stop Erik!

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.785
Erik, please...

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.936
I'm sorry.

01:04:15.103 --> 01:04:16.271
Erik...

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.333
You're Logan, that's Hank
McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.961
You spent the last
couple of days with us.

01:04:43.339 --> 01:04:44.966
You're on acid.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.846
Somebody gave you
really bad acid, yeah?

01:05:34.516 --> 01:05:35.658
Just hold on tight,

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.963
we'll get through this together.

01:05:38.394 --> 01:05:39.687
Oh, my God, Kitty.

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:42.857
She's wounded pretty bad.

01:06:48.173 --> 01:06:49.257
I got him.

01:06:54.012 --> 01:06:55.013
Professor?

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:56.848
What happened to you?

01:06:58.433 --> 01:06:59.826
I just saw someone who's gonna

01:06:59.851 --> 01:07:01.436
bring me a lot of pain someday.

01:07:04.272 --> 01:07:05.273
Where's Raven?

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.192
Gone.
What?

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.402
We have to get out of here.

01:07:09.736 --> 01:07:11.976
We want to know if there's
any sort of connection with...

01:07:18.369 --> 01:07:20.038
<i>Yesterday,
the Paris Peace Summit...</i>

01:07:20.205 --> 01:07:22.916
<i>was rocked by the appearance
of unidentified assailants...</i>

01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:25.335
<i>the likes of which
the world has never seen.</i>

01:07:25.501 --> 01:07:28.213
<i>Mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask...</i>

01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:30.632
<i>"Where did they come from?
Will they be back?"</i>

01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:33.718
<i>And most importantly,
"Are they friend or foe?"</i>

01:07:33.885 --> 01:07:36.888
<i>That was London
correspondent Toby Elliot...</i>

01:07:37.013 --> 01:07:38.893
<i>reporting from the
Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

01:07:40.058 --> 01:07:42.685
What the hell are we dealing with here?
Off the record.

01:07:43.478 --> 01:07:46.856
Two days ago, this
man, Erik Lehnsherr...

01:07:47.023 --> 01:07:49.525
escaped from a maximum security
prison inside the Pentagon.

01:07:49.692 --> 01:07:51.628
We believe that this woman

01:07:51.653 --> 01:07:53.404
is a former associate
of Lehnsherr's.

01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:55.131
They were together in Cuba,

01:07:55.156 --> 01:07:57.575
the day of the crisis in '62.

01:07:57.742 --> 01:08:01.412
He was also implicated
in Kennedy's assassination.

01:08:02.538 --> 01:08:03.915
What about that thing?

01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:05.583
We don't know what
that thing is, sir.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:08.044
Actually, we really don't
know what any of them are.

01:08:08.211 --> 01:08:10.755
Yes. Yes, we do.

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:13.007
They're mutants.

01:08:14.384 --> 01:08:18.346
He has the power
to control metal.

01:08:18.513 --> 01:08:19.822
Last I checked, that's what

01:08:19.847 --> 01:08:21.349
most of your weapons
were made of.

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:25.395
And she can transform
into anyone.

01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:28.356
A general, a secret serviceman.

01:08:28.523 --> 01:08:29.774
Even you,
Mr. President.

01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:31.834
She could walk
into this office...

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:35.530
and order a nuclear strike
if she was in the mood.

01:08:35.697 --> 01:08:37.282
And that's only two of them.

01:08:37.448 --> 01:08:40.451
Do we have any countermeasures?
Any defense?

01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:42.870
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

01:08:43.204 --> 01:08:46.958
That's an experimental program, sir.
Strictly off the books.

01:08:55.758 --> 01:08:58.428
You're telling me these mutants
are out in the world...

01:08:58.594 --> 01:09:01.055
and our best defense
are these giant metal robots?

01:09:01.222 --> 01:09:03.266
Many of the mutants
look like us.

01:09:03.725 --> 01:09:05.893
My Sentinels can
tell the difference.

01:09:06.144 --> 01:09:08.438
I have eight prototypes
ready to go.

01:09:08.604 --> 01:09:10.581
They're built out of
a space-age polymer,

01:09:10.606 --> 01:09:12.275
not an ounce of metal on them.

01:09:18.906 --> 01:09:20.241
I want to make a demonstration.

01:09:20.408 --> 01:09:22.660
I want the world to know
that we can protect them.

01:09:23.161 --> 01:09:24.930
What do you need to get
these things operational?

01:09:24.954 --> 01:09:26.497
I already gave that
number to Congress.

01:09:26.664 --> 01:09:29.417
Unfortunately, they
elected to shut me down.

01:09:29.584 --> 01:09:32.170
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

01:09:32.337 --> 01:09:33.438
Whatever you need.

01:09:33.463 --> 01:09:35.340
Oh, and one more thing.

01:09:35.506 --> 01:09:38.926
If we do manage to capture
them, I would like her.

01:09:39.093 --> 01:09:41.012
For research purposes,
of course.

01:09:46.851 --> 01:09:48.269
Terrible thing.

01:09:49.437 --> 01:09:50.813
What is?

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:52.832
Being born like that.

01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:53.983
Is it?

01:09:54.317 --> 01:09:56.611
Can you imagine...

01:09:56.861 --> 01:09:59.530
Looking in the mirror and seeing that
staring back at you?

01:10:00.615 --> 01:10:03.368
Yes, I can.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.247
Where do you think she comes from?

01:10:08.498 --> 01:10:11.292
You think she has a family?

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.504
Yes.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.506
She does.

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.322
If I see so much
as a screw move,

01:11:06.347 --> 01:11:08.349
I will jam this
into your throat.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.685
How did you find me?

01:11:10.852 --> 01:11:12.353
You taught me well.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.856
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

01:11:16.357 --> 01:11:17.733
I missed you.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.569
You tried to kill me.

01:11:19.735 --> 01:11:21.863
So the rest of us could live.

01:11:23.364 --> 01:11:24.615
What do you mean?

01:11:25.199 --> 01:11:27.201
We received a message
from the future.

01:11:27.368 --> 01:11:29.287
Don't lie to me.

01:11:29.912 --> 01:11:31.914
I never have, and I never will.

01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:36.018
Humans use your blood,
your genes,

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:38.421
to create a weapon
that wipes us all out.

01:11:38.588 --> 01:11:40.064
I was only doing what I thought

01:11:40.089 --> 01:11:42.049
necessary to secure our future.

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:43.569
So what's to stop me
from killing you

01:11:43.593 --> 01:11:45.386
right now and
securing my future?

01:11:46.429 --> 01:11:47.555
Nothing.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:50.725
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:11:50.892 --> 01:11:53.728
They have your DNA. Your
blood was on the street.

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:55.730
Whose fault was that?

01:11:57.398 --> 01:11:58.816
Mine.

01:11:59.734 --> 01:12:03.070
I've seen their plans.
They're creating a weapon.

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:06.157
And now they have what they
need to take it further.

01:12:08.451 --> 01:12:11.787
We have to strike now, while
we still hold the upper hand.

01:12:14.624 --> 01:12:16.667
I've seen too many
friends die, Erik.

01:12:18.753 --> 01:12:21.063
I don't want a war.

01:12:21.088 --> 01:12:22.924
I only want the man
who murdered them.

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.592
This is war.

01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:28.262
What happened to you?

01:12:29.096 --> 01:12:31.349
Did you lose your way
while I was gone?

01:12:33.351 --> 01:12:35.436
Are you still Charles' Raven?

01:12:37.772 --> 01:12:40.191
Or are you Mystique?

01:12:43.611 --> 01:12:45.154
Trask is the enemy.

01:12:47.323 --> 01:12:49.367
Killing one man isn't enough.

01:12:49.784 --> 01:12:51.118
It never was for you.

01:12:52.495 --> 01:12:53.704
Goodbye, Erik.

01:13:18.938 --> 01:13:20.164
What happened?

01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:21.816
Come on.
Can he walk?

01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:23.150
He needs his treatment.

01:13:23.651 --> 01:13:24.835
Hank, I can hear them.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.987
I know. It's okay.

01:13:26.153 --> 01:13:28.197
Can you make it stop?
I'll get them.

01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:31.325
Hey, hey.

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.160
Pull yourself together.

01:13:33.327 --> 01:13:34.829
It's not over yet.

01:13:37.999 --> 01:13:39.375
You don't believe that.

01:13:41.294 --> 01:13:42.670
How do you know?

01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:44.505
As these go...

01:13:46.215 --> 01:13:49.510
this comes back.

01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:52.513
They all come back.

01:13:57.685 --> 01:13:59.103
Look.

01:13:59.854 --> 01:14:01.522
I'm still here...

01:14:02.565 --> 01:14:04.066
and she's still out there.

01:14:06.235 --> 01:14:08.362
We need your help, Charles.

01:14:08.946 --> 01:14:10.531
Not like this.
I need you.

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:14.243
We can't find Raven.
Not without your powers.

01:14:17.872 --> 01:14:20.207
I added a little extra
because you missed a dose.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.048
Charles.

01:14:58.412 --> 01:15:00.539
Hank, do me a favor.

01:15:01.248 --> 01:15:03.542
Would you help me
to my study, please?

01:15:08.547 --> 01:15:10.299
Come on, I got you.

01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.728
Are you sure about this?

01:15:24.105 --> 01:15:26.232
Absolutely not.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:34.949
This creature is extraordinary.

01:15:36.158 --> 01:15:37.843
Her genes could hold the key

01:15:37.868 --> 01:15:39.970
to mutation itself.

01:15:39.995 --> 01:15:41.138
I need more.

01:15:41.163 --> 01:15:43.999
That's all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in Paris.

01:15:44.166 --> 01:15:45.334
More than blood.

01:15:45.835 --> 01:15:47.628
I need brain tissue...

01:15:47.795 --> 01:15:50.423
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

01:15:51.549 --> 01:15:52.775
Imagine...

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.402
Sentinels that could transform,

01:15:54.427 --> 01:15:55.678
adapt to any target.

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:58.597
If I could just get
my hands on her.

01:15:58.764 --> 01:16:00.658
This girl could leap

01:16:00.683 --> 01:16:02.435
the program forward years...

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:04.478
decades into the future.

01:16:05.813 --> 01:16:07.106
How old is your son now, Major?

01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:09.525
Jason?

01:16:09.692 --> 01:16:11.752
He's coming up on ten now,
if you can believe it.

01:16:11.777 --> 01:16:13.279
Eight years from fighting age.

01:16:13.529 --> 01:16:15.423
And how many of
our sons and brothers

01:16:15.448 --> 01:16:17.199
did we just ship
home in body bags?

01:16:17.366 --> 01:16:19.326
Maybe fifty,
fifty-five thousand?

01:16:19.493 --> 01:16:20.953
And how many more
on the other side?

01:16:22.496 --> 01:16:24.331
Never before...

01:16:24.498 --> 01:16:27.501
in all of human history...

01:16:27.668 --> 01:16:32.339
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.676
Until now.

01:16:36.969 --> 01:16:38.971
You really hate,
mutants, don't you?

01:16:39.138 --> 01:16:42.475
On the contrary,
I rather admire them.

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:43.726
The things they can do.

01:16:45.394 --> 01:16:48.355
I see mutants as our salvation.

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:49.690
A common enemy.

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:53.652
A common struggle
against the ultimate enemy.

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.197
Extinction.

01:16:56.655 --> 01:16:57.798
I believe our new friends...

01:16:57.823 --> 01:17:00.201
are going to help us
usher in a new era, Bill.

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:02.703
A new era of genuine...

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:05.623
and long-lasting peace.

01:17:19.595 --> 01:17:21.113
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:23.015
<i>Transport departure
in two hours.</i>

01:17:23.182 --> 01:17:27.186
<i>Repeat. Transport
departure in two hours.</i>

01:17:33.359 --> 01:17:36.153
When was the last
time you were down here?

01:17:36.362 --> 01:17:38.006
The last time we went
looking for students.

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:39.740
A lifetime ago.

01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:47.790
Welcome, Professor.

01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:13.482
Raven's wounded.
She won't be moving fast.

01:18:21.907 --> 01:18:24.243
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:08.829
Charles!

01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:12.374
Charles!

01:19:20.299 --> 01:19:23.093
Charles? It's all right.

01:19:25.679 --> 01:19:27.473
I'll go check the generator.

01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:36.815
It's not the machinery, is it?

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:39.068
I can't do this.
My mind...

01:19:39.193 --> 01:19:40.402
Yes, you can.

01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:42.379
It won't take it.
You're just a little rusty.

01:19:42.404 --> 01:19:44.865
You don't understand. It's not
a question of being rusty.

01:19:45.032 --> 01:19:46.842
I can flip the switches.
I can turn the knobs.

01:19:46.867 --> 01:19:50.496
But my power comes from here.
It comes from...

01:19:51.205 --> 01:19:52.873
And it's broken.

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:55.918
I feel like one of my students.

01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.503
Helpless.

01:19:58.879 --> 01:20:00.230
It was a mistake
coming down here.

01:20:00.255 --> 01:20:01.857
It was a mistake freeing Erik.

01:20:01.882 --> 01:20:04.318
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

01:20:04.343 --> 01:20:06.845
I'm sorry, Logan, but they
sent back the wrong man.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.098
You're right.

01:20:10.432 --> 01:20:11.934
I am.

01:20:12.851 --> 01:20:14.353
Actually, it was
supposed to be you.

01:20:15.396 --> 01:20:18.941
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

01:20:19.608 --> 01:20:20.734
And, uh...

01:20:21.068 --> 01:20:22.653
And I don't know
how long I've got here.

01:20:23.112 --> 01:20:25.906
But I do know that
a long time ago...

01:20:26.532 --> 01:20:28.909
actually, a long
time from now...

01:20:29.243 --> 01:20:32.413
I was your most
helpless student.

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:35.249
And you unlocked my mind.

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:38.085
You showed me what I was.

01:20:38.252 --> 01:20:40.087
You showed me what I could be.

01:20:40.254 --> 01:20:42.256
I don't know how
to do that for you.

01:20:42.423 --> 01:20:44.383
You're right.
I don't.

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:48.303
But I know someone who might.

01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:50.406
Hmm.

01:20:50.431 --> 01:20:53.392
Look into my mind.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.911
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:57.247
You don't want me
inside your head.

01:20:57.271 --> 01:20:58.415
There's no damage you can do...

01:20:58.439 --> 01:20:59.999
that hasn't already
been done. Trust me.

01:21:00.107 --> 01:21:01.108
Come on.

01:21:12.578 --> 01:21:13.620
Hey.

01:21:15.539 --> 01:21:16.640
Hey, Logan.

01:21:16.665 --> 01:21:17.666
Hi, Jean.

01:21:18.125 --> 01:21:19.268
Kill me.

01:21:19.293 --> 01:21:20.294
I love you.

01:21:23.589 --> 01:21:28.110
You poor, poor man.

01:21:28.135 --> 01:21:29.303
Look past me.

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:31.305
No, I don't want your suffering.

01:21:31.472 --> 01:21:33.449
I don't want your future!

01:21:33.474 --> 01:21:35.601
Look past my future.

01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:37.978
Look for your future.

01:21:41.482 --> 01:21:42.816
That's it.

01:21:43.192 --> 01:21:44.443
That's it.

01:21:46.153 --> 01:21:47.488
That's it.

01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:37.371
Charles.

01:22:39.206 --> 01:22:40.582
Charles.

01:22:44.837 --> 01:22:47.214
So this is what becomes of us.

01:22:48.507 --> 01:22:50.342
Erik was right.

01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:53.220
Humanity does this to us.

01:22:53.387 --> 01:22:56.014
Not if we show
them a better path.

01:22:56.932 --> 01:22:58.600
You still believe?

01:22:58.767 --> 01:23:01.228
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

01:23:01.395 --> 01:23:04.231
it doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

01:23:04.857 --> 01:23:08.610
Sometimes we all need
a little help.

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:11.238
Oh, I'm not the man I was.

01:23:13.407 --> 01:23:15.450
I open my mind...

01:23:16.034 --> 01:23:18.245
and it almost overwhelms me.

01:23:18.579 --> 01:23:22.082
You're afraid,
and Cerebro knows it.

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.794
All those voices...

01:23:27.546 --> 01:23:32.217
so much pain.

01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:35.929
It's not their pain
you're afraid of.

01:23:36.096 --> 01:23:38.098
It's yours, Charles.

01:23:39.391 --> 01:23:41.894
And as frightening
as it may be...

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:44.897
that pain will
make you stronger.

01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:48.275
If you allow
yourself to feel it...

01:23:48.442 --> 01:23:50.152
embrace it...

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.255
it will make you more powerful

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.490
than you ever imagined.

01:23:55.657 --> 01:23:57.467
It's the greatest

01:23:57.492 --> 01:23:58.994
gift we have...

01:23:59.161 --> 01:24:01.054
to bear their pain

01:24:01.079 --> 01:24:02.998
without breaking.

01:24:03.165 --> 01:24:04.958
And it's born...

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:07.502
from the most human power.

01:24:08.503 --> 01:24:10.088
Hope.

01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:21.516
Please, Charles...

01:24:21.683 --> 01:24:25.646
we need you to hope again.

01:24:33.946 --> 01:24:36.406
Find what you were looking for?

01:24:42.204 --> 01:24:43.497
The power's back on.

01:24:43.664 --> 01:24:44.957
Yes.

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.709
Yes, it is.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.478
She's lost too much blood.

01:26:30.103 --> 01:26:31.438
She can't keep going like this.

01:26:31.605 --> 01:26:33.774
We have no choice, Bobby.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.275
We can wake him up.
No!

01:26:36.902 --> 01:26:38.153
They need more time.

01:26:38.737 --> 01:26:40.781
I had...

01:26:41.323 --> 01:26:43.325
a glimpse into the past.

01:26:43.492 --> 01:26:44.910
If we wake Logan now...

01:26:45.077 --> 01:26:48.455
we may set our fate
on an even darker course.

01:26:48.663 --> 01:26:50.457
They need more time.

01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:11.436
Raven, stop.

01:27:12.354 --> 01:27:13.980
Stop running.

01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:15.482
Charles?

01:27:17.526 --> 01:27:18.668
Where are you?

01:27:18.693 --> 01:27:19.961
Back at the house...

01:27:19.986 --> 01:27:21.780
where you should be.

01:27:21.947 --> 01:27:24.116
I need you to come home.

01:27:24.825 --> 01:27:26.660
I know what I need to do.

01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:31.598
If you kill Trask...

01:27:31.623 --> 01:27:33.792
you will be creating countless
more just like him.

01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:35.544
Then I'll kill them, too.

01:27:35.669 --> 01:27:38.171
Those are Erik's words,
not yours.

01:27:39.214 --> 01:27:40.715
Oh!

01:27:41.842 --> 01:27:44.344
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:45.470
She was good...

01:27:45.595 --> 01:27:48.181
fair, full of compassion.

01:27:49.516 --> 01:27:51.326
I have compassion.

01:27:51.351 --> 01:27:52.853
Just not for Trask.

01:27:52.978 --> 01:27:54.646
He's murdered too many of us.

01:27:58.525 --> 01:28:00.402
Shut her down, Charles.
Get in her head.

01:28:00.569 --> 01:28:02.028
She's not letting me in.

01:28:02.195 --> 01:28:05.407
I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.375
I know what Trask has done...

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:18.086
but killing him
will not bring them back.

01:28:18.712 --> 01:28:19.855
It will set you on a path...

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.882
from which there is no return.

01:28:22.591 --> 01:28:24.342
An endless cycle of killing.

01:28:24.509 --> 01:28:28.221
Us and them, until
there is nothing left.

01:28:29.097 --> 01:28:33.101
But we can stop it,
right now, you and I.

01:28:34.019 --> 01:28:37.105
You just have to come home.

01:28:38.398 --> 01:28:40.192
I have to?

01:28:40.567 --> 01:28:42.027
You haven't changed
at all, Charles.

01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:44.446
Like I said...

01:28:44.571 --> 01:28:46.948
I know exactly
what I have to do.

01:29:02.255 --> 01:29:03.256
Where is she?

01:29:03.423 --> 01:29:05.425
She's in an
airport, boarding a plane.

01:29:06.134 --> 01:29:07.594
A plane to where?

01:29:10.555 --> 01:29:12.224
Washington, D.C.

01:29:13.934 --> 01:29:17.521
Guys, there's something
I need to show you.

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.733
We're going backwards in time.

01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:23.960
I set the system I designed...

01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:26.363
to record any news about Paris
over all three networks...

01:29:26.738 --> 01:29:27.822
and PBS.

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.783
All three? Wow.

01:29:30.116 --> 01:29:31.785
Yeah, and PBS.

01:29:32.786 --> 01:29:34.204
Look what I found.

01:29:34.371 --> 01:29:35.851
Tomorrow, in front
of the White House,

01:29:35.872 --> 01:29:37.472
the President will
make his announcement.

01:29:37.791 --> 01:29:39.960
He will be joined by Secretary
of Defense Laird...

01:29:40.126 --> 01:29:43.713
and has even sought the help of
renowned scientist Bolivar Trask...

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.384
his special advisor
to combat this mutant issue.

01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:48.693
The White House has asked...

01:29:48.718 --> 01:29:49.945
Raven doesn't realize...

01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:51.905
that if she kills Trask
at an event like that...

01:29:51.930 --> 01:29:54.307
with the whole world watching...

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:57.561
Then I came a long way
for nothing.

01:29:58.103 --> 01:30:00.183
And there's more bad news.
I saw in a report...

01:30:00.647 --> 01:30:02.207
they found traces
of her blood in Paris.

01:30:02.482 --> 01:30:05.485
For all we know,
they already have her DNA...

01:30:05.652 --> 01:30:06.836
which is all they'd need.

01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:08.989
To create the Sentinels
of the future.

01:30:12.576 --> 01:30:14.636
There's a theory
in quantum physics...

01:30:14.661 --> 01:30:16.288
that time is immutable.

01:30:16.496 --> 01:30:18.432
It's like a river. You can
throw a pebble into it...

01:30:18.456 --> 01:30:21.751
and create a ripple, but the
current always corrects itself.

01:30:22.669 --> 01:30:24.604
No matter what you do, the river

01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:26.423
just keeps flowing
in the same direction.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.133
What are you trying to say?

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.176
What I'm saying is...

01:30:30.343 --> 01:30:31.987
what if the war is inevitable?

01:30:32.012 --> 01:30:34.431
What if she's meant
to kill Trask?

01:30:35.974 --> 01:30:38.518
What if this is just
simply who she is?

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.524
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way...

01:30:44.691 --> 01:30:46.693
doesn't mean
they're lost forever.

01:30:51.531 --> 01:30:54.200
No, I don't believe
that theory, Hank.

01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:58.121
And I cannot believe
that is who she is.

01:30:59.372 --> 01:31:00.557
Ready the plane.

01:31:00.582 --> 01:31:03.001
We're going to Washington.

01:32:20.995 --> 01:32:22.497
You all right?

01:32:22.622 --> 01:32:23.665
Getting there.

01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:31.256
Whatever happens today, I need
you to promise me something.

01:32:32.132 --> 01:32:35.260
You've looked into my mind
and seen a lot of bad...

01:32:36.136 --> 01:32:37.804
but you've seen the good, too.

01:32:38.847 --> 01:32:40.515
The X-Men.

01:32:41.766 --> 01:32:43.351
Promise me you'll find us.

01:32:45.145 --> 01:32:47.147
Use your power,
bring us together.

01:32:47.772 --> 01:32:49.858
Guide us. Lead us.

01:32:51.526 --> 01:32:54.320
Storm. Scott.

01:32:56.489 --> 01:32:57.824
Jean.

01:32:59.159 --> 01:33:01.327
Remember those names.

01:33:02.328 --> 01:33:04.664
There are so many of us.

01:33:05.331 --> 01:33:07.667
We will need you, Professor.

01:33:10.628 --> 01:33:13.047
I'll do my best.

01:33:13.214 --> 01:33:14.883
Your best is enough.

01:33:16.801 --> 01:33:18.511
Trust me.

01:33:42.494 --> 01:33:44.954
There's 12 carriers
inbound, 10 miles!

01:33:45.872 --> 01:33:46.956
They've found us.

01:34:04.015 --> 01:34:06.201
Thousands of people
will be gathered here today.

01:34:06.226 --> 01:34:07.703
They've come from
all over the world...

01:34:07.727 --> 01:34:10.563
to witness history,
along with news crews...

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:12.232
from at least 50
different countries.

01:34:13.942 --> 01:34:15.276
Thank you.

01:34:17.695 --> 01:34:19.055
Can I see your
invitations, please?

01:34:19.864 --> 01:34:21.174
Yes, you may.

01:34:21.199 --> 01:34:22.383
These two are with me.

01:34:22.408 --> 01:34:23.510
Go ahead.

01:34:23.535 --> 01:34:24.661
Thank you.

01:34:31.417 --> 01:34:32.794
Logan!

01:34:32.919 --> 01:34:34.519
Please, this way, sir.

01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.161
I haven't found her yet.
But she has to be here.

01:35:03.283 --> 01:35:05.083
<i>The President
of the United States.</i>

01:35:27.807 --> 01:35:29.517
My fellow Americans...

01:35:29.684 --> 01:35:34.355
today we face the gravest
threat in our history...

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.707
mutants.

01:35:38.818 --> 01:35:41.237
We have prepared
for this threat.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.827
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer...

01:35:47.994 --> 01:35:49.120
"Behold."

01:35:49.704 --> 01:35:52.498
"The world will never be
the same again."

01:36:23.029 --> 01:36:24.030
Can I help you?

01:36:27.408 --> 01:36:28.618
No, you can't.

01:37:06.572 --> 01:37:07.824
Here they come.

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.340
<i>This is for you,
brothers and sisters.</i>

01:37:18.835 --> 01:37:19.919
Raven?

01:37:22.672 --> 01:37:23.756
I have her.

01:37:24.424 --> 01:37:25.984
Let me go, Charles.

01:37:27.802 --> 01:37:29.262
There. You see?

01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:30.513
Secret Serviceman.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.764
Left of the stage.

01:37:31.889 --> 01:37:33.016
- Got him.
- Go.

01:37:53.786 --> 01:37:55.138
What the hell are you doing?

01:37:55.163 --> 01:37:56.639
I didn't tell you
to activate them.

01:37:56.664 --> 01:37:57.832
I didn't.

01:38:16.434 --> 01:38:18.311
<i>Raven, please, listen to me.</i>

01:38:18.811 --> 01:38:22.940
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

01:38:24.984 --> 01:38:26.360
<i>Don't do this.</i>

01:38:29.781 --> 01:38:32.033
Gentlemen, you cannot
pass this point.

01:38:39.874 --> 01:38:41.626
We can't stop that many.

01:38:41.793 --> 01:38:44.670
No, but we can slow them down.

01:39:22.542 --> 01:39:24.210
Erik!

01:39:58.494 --> 01:39:59.495
Ah!

01:40:09.046 --> 01:40:10.756
Storm!

01:40:29.150 --> 01:40:30.626
Go, go, go!

01:40:32.528 --> 01:40:33.613
Watch your head!

01:40:46.584 --> 01:40:47.727
Go, go, go!

01:40:47.752 --> 01:40:49.128
Take us to DEFCON 3.

01:40:49.295 --> 01:40:50.563
Mr. President,
we are Code Red.

01:40:50.588 --> 01:40:51.964
What's our air
defense readiness?

01:40:52.131 --> 01:40:53.442
All our air
defenses are ready one.

01:40:53.466 --> 01:40:54.942
What the hell
happened out there?

01:40:54.967 --> 01:40:56.110
I will fix it.

01:40:56.135 --> 01:40:57.178
You said that before.

01:40:57.303 --> 01:40:58.512
I wanted to make a statement.

01:40:58.638 --> 01:41:01.490
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

01:41:01.515 --> 01:41:02.658
I will fix it.

01:41:02.683 --> 01:41:04.477
You damn well better.

01:42:15.923 --> 01:42:16.924
Charles!

01:42:18.050 --> 01:42:19.385
No, no, no...

01:43:05.973 --> 01:43:07.725
Is everybody okay?

01:43:41.592 --> 01:43:43.177
No!

01:43:46.305 --> 01:43:47.348
Behind you.

01:43:49.725 --> 01:43:51.602
Ah!

01:44:32.017 --> 01:44:33.352
Now!

01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:59.253
I'm probably not supposed
to ask this kind of thing...

01:44:59.753 --> 01:45:02.381
but in the future, do I make it?

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.175
No.

01:45:05.885 --> 01:45:07.361
But we can change that.

01:45:07.386 --> 01:45:08.929
Right?

01:45:19.565 --> 01:45:21.192
Do what you were made for.

01:45:30.409 --> 01:45:31.911
Where are you?

01:45:37.708 --> 01:45:38.709
Ah!

01:45:49.261 --> 01:45:50.763
I got this! Go!

01:46:33.472 --> 01:46:35.140
Oh, dear God, no.

01:46:51.031 --> 01:46:53.284
So much for being a survivor.

01:47:35.743 --> 01:47:37.036
One of them is in here.

01:47:39.663 --> 01:47:41.415
No, no, no!
Don't kill it!

01:47:42.082 --> 01:47:43.167
I need it alive.

01:47:56.597 --> 01:47:58.223
What the hell has happened?

01:49:05.999 --> 01:49:08.210
You built these
weapons to destroy us.

01:49:09.169 --> 01:49:10.879
Why?

01:49:14.466 --> 01:49:17.177
<i>Because you are
afraid of our gifts.</i>

01:49:18.137 --> 01:49:20.639
<i>Because we are different.</i>

01:49:21.807 --> 01:49:25.144
<i>Humanity has always feared
that which is different.</i>

01:49:25.811 --> 01:49:27.187
<i>Well, I am here to tell you...</i>

01:49:27.396 --> 01:49:28.814
to tell the world...

01:49:29.815 --> 01:49:31.984
you are right to fear us.

01:49:32.359 --> 01:49:34.069
<i>We are the future.</i>

01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:37.489
<i>We are the ones
who will inherit this earth.</i>

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:40.325
And anyone who
stands in our way...

01:49:40.492 --> 01:49:42.494
will suffer the same fate
as these men...

01:49:42.661 --> 01:49:43.996
you see before you.

01:49:51.211 --> 01:49:53.839
<i>Today was meant to be a
display of your power.</i>

01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:56.675
Instead I give you a glimpse...

01:49:56.842 --> 01:50:00.345
<i>of the devastation my race
can unleash upon yours.</i>

01:50:09.563 --> 01:50:11.732
<i>Let this be a warning
to the world.</i>

01:50:12.441 --> 01:50:15.235
<i>And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there...</i>

01:50:16.028 --> 01:50:17.446
<i>I say this.</i>

01:50:18.197 --> 01:50:19.865
<i>No more hiding.</i>

01:50:20.032 --> 01:50:21.867
<i>No more suffering.</i>

01:50:22.701 --> 01:50:25.078
You have lived in the shadows...

01:50:25.245 --> 01:50:28.081
<i>in shame and fear for too long.
Come out.</i>

01:50:29.333 --> 01:50:30.726
<i>Join me.</i>

01:50:30.751 --> 01:50:34.254
<i>Fight together in
a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.548
A new tomorrow...

01:50:37.758 --> 01:50:39.551
that starts today.

01:50:46.767 --> 01:50:48.602
<i>All those years wasted...</i>

01:50:48.769 --> 01:50:50.771
fighting each other, Charles.

01:50:54.316 --> 01:50:57.945
To have a precious
few of them back...

01:51:36.692 --> 01:51:37.960
Mr. President, sir.
Stand down.

01:51:37.985 --> 01:51:39.862
I said, stand down!

01:51:41.697 --> 01:51:43.365
You want to make a statement?

01:51:43.824 --> 01:51:45.617
Kill me. Fine.

01:51:45.784 --> 01:51:47.703
But spare everyone else.

01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.342
Very heroic,
Mr. President...

01:52:02.843 --> 01:52:04.344
but you had no intention...

01:52:04.469 --> 01:52:06.680
of sparing any of us.

01:52:07.139 --> 01:52:10.534
The future of our
species begins now.

01:52:46.011 --> 01:52:47.237
You used to be a better shot.

01:52:47.262 --> 01:52:48.513
Trust me, I still am.

01:53:02.361 --> 01:53:03.862
Get out of my head, Charles!

01:53:04.029 --> 01:53:05.530
Raven.

01:53:05.697 --> 01:53:07.574
Please, do not make us
the enemy today.

01:53:07.783 --> 01:53:09.618
Look around you.
We already are.

01:53:10.118 --> 01:53:11.870
Not all of us.

01:53:12.079 --> 01:53:14.331
All you've done so far...

01:53:14.665 --> 01:53:16.667
is save the lives of these men.

01:53:17.709 --> 01:53:20.253
You can show them a better path.

01:53:23.924 --> 01:53:25.384
Shut her down, Charles.

01:53:27.594 --> 01:53:31.223
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met...

01:53:31.598 --> 01:53:33.600
and look where that's got us.

01:53:35.727 --> 01:53:38.563
Everything that happens now...

01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:41.400
is in your hands.

01:53:45.445 --> 01:53:48.240
I have faith in you, Raven.

01:55:26.922 --> 01:55:29.049
He's all yours, Charles.

01:55:56.618 --> 01:55:59.246
If you let them have me,
I'm as good as dead.

01:55:59.412 --> 01:56:00.789
You know that.

01:56:01.456 --> 01:56:03.041
I know.

01:56:05.043 --> 01:56:06.711
Goodbye, old friend.

01:56:09.381 --> 01:56:11.216
Goodbye, Erik.

01:56:44.624 --> 01:56:46.626
Are you sure you
should let them go?

01:56:47.586 --> 01:56:48.962
Yes.

01:56:49.588 --> 01:56:51.298
I have hope for them.

01:56:52.465 --> 01:56:56.469
There's going to be a time,
Hank, when we are all together.

01:57:00.348 --> 01:57:02.309
What about Logan?

01:57:34.132 --> 01:57:36.801
<i>The first time</i>

01:57:39.804 --> 01:57:45.060
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

01:57:50.023 --> 01:57:53.418
<i>I thought the sun...</i>

01:58:17.926 --> 01:58:21.238
Buckminster Fuller is a
great example of an architect...

01:58:21.263 --> 01:58:25.517
whose ideas were very similar
to those of a utopian future.

01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:34.526
Good morning, Logan.
Late start.

01:58:44.619 --> 01:58:45.954
Have a good lunch.

01:58:46.121 --> 01:58:47.372
- Good job.
- Thank you.

01:58:47.706 --> 01:58:49.040
Very good job.

01:58:49.916 --> 01:58:51.501
Storm.

01:59:22.574 --> 01:59:23.658
Jean.

01:59:25.076 --> 01:59:26.411
Hey, Logan.

01:59:26.953 --> 01:59:28.079
Jean.

01:59:28.788 --> 01:59:30.498
Are you okay?

01:59:32.250 --> 01:59:33.668
You're here.

01:59:34.294 --> 01:59:36.338
Where else would I be?

01:59:38.631 --> 01:59:39.632
Whoa.

01:59:40.467 --> 01:59:42.427
Easy, pal.

01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:46.514
Well, some things never change.

01:59:47.932 --> 01:59:49.517
It's good to see you, Scott.

01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:52.620
Uh-huh.

01:59:52.645 --> 01:59:53.813
See you later, Jean.

01:59:57.942 --> 01:59:59.486
Professor.

01:59:59.944 --> 02:00:02.739
Logan, is everything all right?

02:00:06.117 --> 02:00:07.577
Yeah.

02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:10.455
Yeah, I think it is.

02:00:27.013 --> 02:00:28.281
You did it.

02:00:28.306 --> 02:00:29.616
Did what?

02:00:29.641 --> 02:00:31.643
Logan, don't you have
a class to teach?

02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:33.978
A class to teach?

02:00:35.021 --> 02:00:36.106
History.

02:00:36.815 --> 02:00:38.316
History?

02:00:39.150 --> 02:00:40.819
Actually, I could use
some help with that.

02:00:41.319 --> 02:00:42.821
Help with what?

02:00:42.987 --> 02:00:46.491
Pretty much
everything after 1973.

02:00:51.037 --> 02:00:54.082
I think the history I know
is a little different.

02:00:55.708 --> 02:00:57.419
Welcome back.

02:01:00.171 --> 02:01:01.840
It's good to see you, Charles.

02:01:03.216 --> 02:01:05.051
It's good to see everyone.

02:01:05.218 --> 02:01:06.719
Well...

02:01:07.345 --> 02:01:09.514
I had a promise to keep.

02:01:10.682 --> 02:01:13.935
You and I have a lot of
catching up to do.

02:01:14.853 --> 02:01:16.354
Yeah.

02:01:19.899 --> 02:01:22.026
What's the last thing
you remember?

02:01:27.115 --> 02:01:28.867
Drowning.

02:01:37.125 --> 02:01:38.376
<i>The past.</i>

02:01:39.878 --> 02:01:41.187
<i>A new...</i>

02:01:41.212 --> 02:01:42.964
<i>and uncertain world.</i>

02:01:54.392 --> 02:01:56.686
<i>A world of
endless possibilities.</i>

02:01:59.439 --> 02:02:01.566
<i>And infinite outcomes.</i>

02:02:03.234 --> 02:02:04.360
You kidding me?

02:02:04.486 --> 02:02:05.945
Oh, he's alive!

02:02:10.325 --> 02:02:13.077
<i>Countless
choices define our fate.</i>

02:02:13.995 --> 02:02:16.456
<i>Each choice, each moment...</i>

02:02:16.623 --> 02:02:19.250
<i>a ripple in the river of time.</i>

02:02:19.417 --> 02:02:21.753
What do you want us to do
with him, Major Stryker?

02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:23.671
<i>Enough ripples...</i>

02:02:23.838 --> 02:02:26.424
<i>and you change the tide.</i>

02:02:26.591 --> 02:02:27.675
I'll take him from here.

02:02:27.842 --> 02:02:31.763
<i>For the future
is never truly set.</i>
