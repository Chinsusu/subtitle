00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.880
Where are you going?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.291
Help me!

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.039
Over here!

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.880
Go!

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.321
Go!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.527
That was a B-29, bub. There's
no outrunning what's coming.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.565
Yashida!

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.170
You're better off down here.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.759
I'd hurry if I were you.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.001
Run. Now!

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.964
Stay down!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.807
No, wait!
No, no. Wait.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.326
No. It's not safe.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.170
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.323
Where were you?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.366
Nagasaki.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.687
That far back?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.681
You're here.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.921
Of course.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.889
Can you stay?

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.645
You know I can't.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.802
Jean, I'm so sorry.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.201
I know.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.006
I'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.491
I made a vow.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.044
A solemn vow?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.402
You're making fun of me.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.482
It's too late.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.604
No! No, Jean!

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.205
No, no, no! Please!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.446
You can't hide.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.601
No, no, no! Please!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.961
You can't hide!

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.645
No, Jean! No!

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.361
No.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.563
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.559
Got the arrows?
Yeah.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.286
Remember the arrows?

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.250
Yeah, yeah, Eddie, we got them!

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.799
Yeah!

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.566
Hey!

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.650
What are you doing?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.370
Man, you almost
blew his foot off!

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.449
You're not a hunter, are you?

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.085
Not anymore.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.448
What the hell?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.930
Don't make me do this.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.805
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.442
We didn't hear
nothing except twigs.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.211
Then it just came upon us.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.370
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.006
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.928
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.761
I'm the one that survived.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.565
I'd like to buy
this man a drink.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.361
What's your name, mister?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.130
It's Logan.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.409
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.650
Go ahead,
ask me where I found it.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.564
Ask me.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.320
Where did you find it?

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.482
Well, funny you should ask.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.802
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.559
Whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.005
to track the animal properly...

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.320
and put it out of its misery.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.483
Instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.565
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.410
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.284
Because I don't dip
my arrows in anything.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.527
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.601
Damn.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.290
That hurt.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.201
Sorry, Jean.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.641
I wouldn't bother with them.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.963
Most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.007
Three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.642
This sword is
hundreds of years old...

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.202
and was named <i>Danzan</i> by the
first samurai who used it.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.204
<i>Danzan</i> means "separator"
in Japanese.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.447
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.086
Whoa!

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.204
Like so.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.601
I'm parked in back.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.730
Get in.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.721
Sorry, it's a rental.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.651
Who are you?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.485
Me? I'm Yukio.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.085
And?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.807
I've been trying to find
you for over a year.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.481
Why?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.682
To give you that.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.129
My employer
wanted you to have it.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.131
Who's your employer?

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.330
Master Yashida.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:59.441
He said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.122
Master Yashida is dying.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.127
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.729
He knows that you are a...

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.966
busy man.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.647
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.724
All right, where is he?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.120
Tokyo.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.362
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.040
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.330
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.005
All right?
I've got things to do.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.566
Do not apologize.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.246
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.721
That's not who I am
anymore, you understand?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.721
Interesting.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.680
Why did you go into that
bar, if not to seek justice?

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.976
I don't know.
You don't know.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.240
No!
I think you know.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.402
Pull over.
You are a soldier.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.846
No, I'm not.
Pull over.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.119
You are a soldier.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.849
Pull over, now!

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.320
Now.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.765
You are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.087
And what's that?

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.762
An honorable death.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.126
An end to your pain.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.449
Who says I'm in pain?

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.770
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.680
One day.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.848
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.650
Okay.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.609
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.850
Fifteen hours?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.360
You don't like to fly?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.445
I love it.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.286
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.566
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.481
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.559
<i>Kuzuri.</i>
What does that mean?

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.925
Monster.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.367
No pain?

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.090
You have no...
Oh, yeah. Pain.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.485
Plenty of pain.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.569
How old are you?

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.363
It's been a long time.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.091
Many wars.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.291
Understand?

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.769
Too many fuckin' wars.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.965
We are almost there.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.885
So, you can see the future?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.968
I can read a map.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.689
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.522
I know they are going to die.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.522
We are all going to die.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.208
You said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.882
If you're right,
that's quite a talent.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.209
We don't all have claws.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.211
So, do I die on this plane?

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.881
No.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.371
Not on this plane.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.929
Don't let the lights fool you.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.124
These are dark days in Japan.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.599
Some believe when Master
Yashida got sick,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.761
a shadow fell upon us.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.924
Do you think he's a god?

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.403
No. A man.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.165
But a great one.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.450
After the war, he helped
rebuild the nation.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.206
And the family business
became Japan's largest.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.483
Wow. Did they give you a
little card to memorize?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.442
I owe Master Yashida my life.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.525
Don't be a dick.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.159
A lot of guns.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.685
There have been attacks.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.565
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.051
BY Who?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.731
The Japanese mob, the Yakuza.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.679
They've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.845
Hip replacement.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.771
Uh, too small.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:45.805
Too small.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.686
Hey.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.121
This way.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.531
Who's that?

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.607
Shingen, Master Yashida's son.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.241
He's good.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.761
He's all right.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.445
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.762
Master Yashida is traditional.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.890
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.922
That's Mariko,
his granddaughter.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.326
Mariko.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.410
What's wrong with you?

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.041
You haven't answered my emails.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.285
I can't tell you now.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.044
Yes, you can.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.523
Who is the caveman?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.811
The man Grandfather
wanted me to find.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.167
You can't bring
him in like that.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.770
Shizu and Saki are going
to disinfect you.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.681
Give you a shave.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.370
Like hell they are.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.365
Get in the tub.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.001
Whoa.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.242
Get in the tub.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.326
Really?

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.326
All right.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.766
Okay. Okay.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.321
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.440
What?

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.726
What?

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.885
You look nice.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.528
I feel violated.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.324
Prepare two more
suppressors for Master Yashida.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.404
And check his blood pressure.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.650
Yashida<i>-sama.</i>

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.766
Oh...

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.207
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.643
You look the same.

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.164
But, then, that is no surprise.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.964
Dr. Green.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.642
Leave us, please.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.169
Five minutes, no more.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.165
My oncologist.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.001
Well done.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.765
Oh, forget the etiquette.
I'm past such precautions.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.362
For many years I have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.841
Yeah, well...

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.730
You were kind to me.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.609
And you were kind
to many people.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.169
I saw that even from that well.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.328
The painting is from
the village of my birth.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.130
It depicts the bravery and
skill of the Black Clan.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.766
Ninja warriors.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.969
They served my family
for seven centuries.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.321
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.929
I wanted to repay you.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.650
To offer you something
no one else can.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.968
A gift to equal
the life you gave to me.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.850
I don't need anything.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.445
Nota thing.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.845
Eternity can be a curse.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.725
It hasn't been easy for
you, living without time.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.642
The losses you
have had to suffer.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.044
A man can run out
of things to live for.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.490
Lose his purpose.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.369
Become a ronin.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.849
A samurai without a master.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.006
I can end your eternity.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.086
Make you mortal.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:57.046
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.170
Yashida Industries
can do anything.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.323
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.527
Passed?

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.205
From you to another.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.849
You have struggled
long enough, Logan.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.441
I'm confused.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.241
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.129
I am the same man.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.760
I was not ready to die then.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.446
I am not ready to die now.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.446
But you are...

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.444
aren't you?

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.682
Are you offering to kill me?
No.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.763
Not right away.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.569
You can live a long
and ordinary life.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.806
Fall in love, have a family...

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.883
grow old.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.209
And one day,
die an ordinary death.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.050
It can be done.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.604
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.809
Please, Logan-<i>san.</i>
I need you again.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.406
I fear for my family.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.086
I fear for everything
I have built.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.402
Enough. You should leave.
Please, Logan<i>-san.</i>

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.005
They're going to kill her.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.843
Who?

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.288
Mariko, my granddaughter.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.281
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.319
You don't want what I've got.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.241
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.846
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.930
Lord Shingen, your father
is asking for you.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.923
It is time.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.649
I need to speak with my father...

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.169
before he speaks to Grandfather.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.323
He'll talk to you later, Mariko.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.010
Father! I need to see you now!

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.964
Not now, Mariko!

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.002
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.361
Let go.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.284
You about done?

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.688
Let go of me.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.291
He just wanted
to say goodbye, huh?

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.405
You two grew up together.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.201
Yes.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.569
But you're not her sister.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.046
No.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.571
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.444
He brought Mariko to see a
factory he was building.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.008
I was digging through the
garbage for something to eat.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.610
So they just took
you home with them?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.322
It was always difficult for
Mariko to make friends.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.121
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.523
Sleep here.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.244
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.169
I'm still dying.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.206
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.167
There is no easy way to say this.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.964
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.288
I have tried, father.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.841
You've done the best you can.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.886
You have always been
my assumed successor.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.279
So the past few years,
as a test,

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.248
I allowed you more control.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.879
It has been an honor.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.089
And I now realize
that was a mistake.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.767
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.724
When I die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.239
Father, I'm sorry if I
have disappointed you...

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.242
Let's not insult one another.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.683
You are not the man
to lead Yashida.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.484
You cannot bring in
someone from the outside.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.807
In that, you are correct.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.005
That will never happen.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.890
<i>Eternity can be a curse...</i>

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.040
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.602
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.801
How old are you?

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.930
Interesting offer.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.451
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.646
I thought you
wanted to be with me.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.120
Come here.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.881
He's dead.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.282
I didn't foresee it.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.726
Who's that?
With Mariko.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.370
His name is Noburo Mori.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.131
Minister of Justice,
a rising star.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.886
He's Mariko's fiancé.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.042
You need to bow.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.559
Bow.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.089
Lord Shingen,
this is Mr. Logan.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.083
I know who he is.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.439
Your father was a good man.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.207
He would often say
the same about you.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.087
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:34.329
Tell me, why do you think he sent
our little Yukio to fetch you?

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.765
To say goodbye.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.602
And now you have.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.840
Time for you to go
back to your cave.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.967
Anyone else you want me to meet?

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.323
I Pledge to you...

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.405
Master Yashida...

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.563
to be vigilant...

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.683
and to dedicate my life...

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.888
to protect Mariko.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.087
That armor belonged
to <i>Shiruba-Samurai...</i>

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.527
the Silver Samurai.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.127
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.485
Logan?

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.089
Hey.
Something's not right.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.399
Let go.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.527
Logan!

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.804
Logan!

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.321
Logan!

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.961
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.570
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.039
Yukio!
Mariko!

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.005
Mariko!

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.370
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.844
Here, here! Here!

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.241
Move!

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.208
In here! Move!

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.485
Keep moving, keep moving.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.770
Move!

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.444
You're bleeding.
You need help.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.125
Just keep moving.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.123
Thank you for
what you did back there.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.884
Those were Yakuza.
I'm fine.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.724
Why are they after you?

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.406
I'm fine. I can make
my way from here.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.207
You should go.
Get yourself a doctor.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.879
Whoa!

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.001
That's nice.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.568
This is one of those
bullet trains, right?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:54.563
I told you I don't
need your help.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.963
So what do they do,
like, 300 miles an hour?

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.929
This cowardly attack was...

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.049
the work of Yakuza thugs.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:16.365
A violent
response to my efforts...

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.729
to crack down on
organized crime.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.731
They exited the North Gate.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:27.770
She was with the stranger...

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.887
Your <i>gaijin</i> friend, where is he?

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.562
Last I saw, he was
protecting your daughter.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.649
You are a toy doll.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.963
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.327
Keep that in mind.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.841
So, where are we headed, Mariko?

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.521
Where are we going?

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.559
I'm going to the end
of the line.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.881
My family has a home
in the South.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:17.680
That's stupid.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.284
No offense, but they're gonna
know to look for you there.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.443
Not this place.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.771
You want to be left alone. Yes.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.119
I understand.
Do you?

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.610
Oh, yeah.
Trust me.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.881
Problem is, if I do that...

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.321
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.441
You can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.361
Unless you want to die. In that
case, you're playing this perfectly.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.164
Oh... What the hell?

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.406
Oh...

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.684
What the hell is happening?

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.121
What happened to you?

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.924
We get off here.
Let's go.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:25.936
Just listen to me, will you? We
need to find someplace safe.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.770
I don't understand. How do
you know they were Yakuza?

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.481
They were the same
guys from the temple.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.056
How do you know
they were after me?

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.239
Look, we need to
find someplace safe.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.416
We need to get off the streets.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.329
I don't understand.
Shut up! Listen.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.926
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:40.605
Straight ahead.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.122
So, where's
the nice part of town?

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.611
Another eight blocks that way.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.808
Good.
We're staying here.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.810
Let's go.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.808
This is a love hotel.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.325
A what?

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.005
A love hotel.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.011
For couples, understand?

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.489
Uh... Right.

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.486
Hey.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.850
Uh, two rooms. Adjoining
rooms, on the same floor.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.327
Right next
to each other. Very close.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.889
Same floor. Same floor.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.121
What did she say?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.209
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.241
She's asking if we prefer "the
dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.691
or the "mission to Mars."

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:16.205
This'll do.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.447
<i>Liftoff!
We have a liftoff!</i>

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.762
Kind of homey, actually.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.770
Where do you plan on sleeping?

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.560
I don't.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:14.245
That's a lot of blood.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.804
I thought you were
done being the hero.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.444
But these guys were...
trying to kill her.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.248
Just let it go.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.370
It's not hard to die.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:36.003
Come to me.

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.161
Eh!

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.647
Oh.

00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.281
Logan...

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.319
You're slipping.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.641
Logan...

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:37.560
Kill him already!

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:40.690
Wanna say something
before you die, <i>gaijin?</i>

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.562
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.324
Is he a doctor?

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.161
In a manner of speaking, yes.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.727
He's a veterinarian...

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.484
student.

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.730
Large animal.

00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.439
Uh... Thanks.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.124
Whoa.

00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:38.410
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.564
Okay, okay, okay.

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.521
Hey.

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.404
Thank you.

00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:02.801
I never needed this before.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:05.281
What? Help?

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:14.080
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.287
Who is she?

00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.967
He met her last year when he
was in America for treatment.

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.999
Your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.081
passed on.

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.360
I'm not getting better,
not like before.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.490
She did this to me.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.879
Blondie!

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.041
Blondie!

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.849
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.399
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.050
So you haven't found them?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.241
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.246
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.239
I can slit your
pretty mouth open,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.322
before you open it to
say one more stupid...

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.286
Ah...

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.570
I asked you to do
one thing, little man.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.524
Bring me the mutant.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.639
I don't work for you.
I work for the House of...

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.605
You work for Yashida, I get it.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.529
Yet you cannot
fulfill his dying wish.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.568
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:03.042
Where is Logan?
I am not done with him.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.879
The mutant has powers.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:16.040
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.925
I did that.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.731
I suppressed his power
so he could be taken.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.123
You see, it's me
you should respect.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.201
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.888
We get off here.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.809
Where are we?

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.529
Just outside Nagasaki.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.091
This way.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.607
This is the guy from
the funeral, the archer.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.923
He was your boyfriend.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.162
That's Harada.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.323
We were village
champions that summer.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.405
He with the bow
and me with the knives.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.646
Harada and I were
planning to get married.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.370
What stopped you?

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.846
Grandfather.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.685
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.204
From the mountain, from the sea.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.044
Chopsticks upright
are a bad omen.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.048
It resembles incense
at a funeral.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.046
Nothing is without meaning.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.199
So, the other night
at the house,

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:03.601
when you ran out in the rain...

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.922
what did that mean?

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.688
My grandfather was dying.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.399
You knew he was gonna die.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.679
He'd been sick for a long time.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:16.206
It wasn't his death I feared.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.603
So, what, then?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.769
What did he tell you that night?

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.681
Mariko, why did
your father hit you?

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.285
I was trying to warn him.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.090
About what?

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.927
What did your
grandfather tell you?

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.249
He told me that...

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.801
in three days, when
they read his will...

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.444
I will become the most
powerful person in Japan.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.084
He gave it all to me.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.881
The company?

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.122
I didn't want it.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.288
He knew that.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.245
I don't understand
why he gave it to me.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:20.001
It was all my father dreamed of.

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.009
Well, that's why.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.641
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.806
Noburo.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.644
Does he know about this?

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.131
No.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.329
Why are you marrying him?

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.762
He seems like
kind of an asshole.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.007
My father arranged it last year.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.481
What?

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.883
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.608
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.926
I don't expect
you to understand.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.961
You're not Japanese.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.206
Our island is long and thin.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.842
Trains only run
in two directions.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.851
I assure you Lord Shingen...

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.883
my officers are
making every effort...

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.003
Then they're idiots.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.088
You've wasted enough of my time.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.048
I have my father's
affairs to attend to.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.085
Get out and find her!

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.043
Tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.808
They open the will
in three days.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.044
We are running out of time.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.562
Soon, I hope.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.889
I'm sending men to the South.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.042
That's where
we found the bodies.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.889
If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.491
they had someone inside.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.161
They'll never find me here.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.005
You're not safe.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.925
I'm coming down there.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.526
They'll follow you.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.080
Please.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.766
Wait a few days.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.286
Please. I'm fine.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.171
Logan's here.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.442
He's wounded, Mariko.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.399
Someone's here.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.159
Mariko?

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160
I have to go.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.401
Mariko?

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.411
A tree fell on the road.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.604
The men could use some help.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.530
Are you okay?

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.400
Tired.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.524
Do you need something?

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.721
No.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.966
This will help.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.250
It's time.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.121
What?

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.891
Please. Take it.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.925
Thank you.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.611
No.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.810
Two hands.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.080
Japanese sword
require two hands.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.042
Like that?
That's it.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.648
It's beautiful, Yashida.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.766
But I can't take it.

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.566
Please.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.926
Thank you.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.521
Keep it safe.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.329
Keep it safe for me.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.491
Someday, I'll come get it.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.003
It's time.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.361
I was here when it happened.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.241
It's how I met your grandfather.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.682
We hid in there.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.725
I heard the stories.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.050
My grandfather would say...

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.363
what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.082
Eventually.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.886
That man can
recover from anything.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:31.486
Maybe you, too.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.562
You don't sleep very well.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.722
You call out in the night.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.606
Who's Jean?

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.371
We should go back.
There's rain coming.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.645
I'll make tea.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.131
For you.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.570
This isn't right.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.488
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.642
Your grandfather
called me a ronin.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:43.401
A samurai without a master.

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:48.443
He said I was destined
to live forever...

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.006
with no reason to live.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.485
Was he right?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.091
Yes.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.969
Still?

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.161
Hey.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.730
What are you doing?

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.800
This isn't going to end well.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.202
Everyone you love dies.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.882
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.684
Do you know what that means?

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.203
An animal.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.605
A fierce creature with long
claws and sharp teeth.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.728
It fears nothing.

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:02.570
When I was a girl,
I had nightmares.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.641
I'd wake up and
run to my parents.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.285
My father would get angry.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.803
"Go back to sleep.
Face your fears."

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.766
My grandfather was different.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.486
He told me stories
about <i>Kuzuri,</i> his friend.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.449
Who he met at the bottom
of a well.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:36.088
He said the <i>Kuzuri</i> was
magical and saved his life.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.770
He said <i>Kuzuri</i> would protect
me, too, as I slept in my bed.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.530
Who's Jean?

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.685
Is she like you?

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.442
What happened to her?

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.649
She died.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.124
I killed her.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.723
Along with the Kuzuri.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.400
Logan.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.683
Mariko?

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080
Logan!

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.211
Logan!

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.841
Mariko?

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:37.726
Mariko!

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.443
No! Logan!

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.361
No!

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.440
Logan!

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.967
No!

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.040
Mariko!

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.601
Logan!

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:11.401
No!

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:14.721
Logan!

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.564
Mariko! Mariko!

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.245
Logan!

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.920
Where are they taking her?

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:42.804
Where are they taking her?

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.450
Where, you piece of shit?

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.931
I no talk, <i>gaijin.</i>

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.489
I never talk.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.127
Who hired you?

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.009
Uh-oh.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.964
Take me to Noburo.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.643
Logan...
Take me to him.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.800
I need to tell you something.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.883
Do it. Now.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.083
You wait in the car.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.562
Logan.
What?

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.323
I saw you die.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.005
What?

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.244
I saw you die.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:04.682
When? Just now?

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.849
Awhile ago.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.890
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.327
More like looking
through a keyhole.

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.121
But I'm always right.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.368
All I can see is one part
of a person's life...

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.530
their death.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.481
And I saw yours.

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.563
So, what did you see?

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.364
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.409
You're holding your own
heart in your hand.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.528
It's not beating.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.600
I don't have time for this shit.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.766
When I was five, I knew how
my own parents would die.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.607
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.721
Look at me.

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.571
A lot of people have tried to
kill me, and I'm still here.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:08.690
Yeah...

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.366
but you're different
now, aren't you?

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:14.043
They can hurt you.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.202
They can kill you.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.362
Just wait in the car.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.202
I said, wait in the car.
You need backup.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.243
You're not safe,
not in your condition.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.601
Just think of me
as your bodyguard.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.409
Sexy.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.408
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.929
Okay, round four.
Here we go.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.485
Drink for you, my lady.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.561
Get out.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.924
Not you.

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.001
Call me old-fashioned...

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:44.799
but I thought
being engaged meant

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.136
you were done with
this kind of bullshit.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.639
I am the Minister of Justice.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.056
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.039
Really? You're gonna
try and talk tough,

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.849
standing there in
your red underwear?

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.446
You have ten words...

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.967
ten words...

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.483
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.484
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.239
And if I don't
like what you say,

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:08.846
you are going through
that fucking window.

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:11.879
You don't have the faintest
idea what's going on...

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.568
How many words was that?
Nine.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.371
Nine.
You have one word left.

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:23.043
Really?

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.810
Really?

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.645
Shingen. Shingen!

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.801
Keep going.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.291
Since he got sick...

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.962
old man Yashida spent
billions on doctors, healers.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.885
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North...

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.441
secretly trying
to prolong his life.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.729
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.042
He was obsessed with you.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.926
English!

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.484
Shingen lied,
protected the old man...

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.849
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.401
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.799
And then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.326
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.480
It's true.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.689
Mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding...

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.320
not once the will was revealed.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.246
She never took to me.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.524
Oh, really?
A class act like you.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:22.845
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.607
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.682
Political careers
don't last forever.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480
That's right.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.523
Wait! Wait! No!

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.445
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.169
I didn't like it.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.171
Wow.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.576
How did you know there's
a pool down there?

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.011
I didn't.

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:07.689
Did you know I
studied biology in college?

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.005
Genetics.

01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:17.486
There are genes
that skip generations.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.764
Recessive genes.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.359
Eyes.

01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.486
Eyes. Hair.

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.166
Talent.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.050
Temperament.

01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.408
Not every child gets the same.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.322
My father saw
little of himself in me.

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:41.005
But in you...

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:43.767
he faced a mirror.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.850
How did you
convince my father...

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.490
to award you control...

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.125
of Asia's largest corporation?

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.045
You've gone insane.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.329
I'm just waking up.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.650
If you kill me, you will lose...

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.769
what little honor you have left.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.681
Fear not Mariko.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.327
I don't want to hurt you.

01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.806
I want to help you.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.690
Help you end your pain...

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.160
what that mutant stopped you...

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:32.646
from doing last week.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.081
I never wanted to die, Father.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:53.959
It's alright, Mariko.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:28:59.842
Come with me.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.960
What is happening?!

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.327
More than you can imagine.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.284
You.

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.170
Me.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.041
Sorry to interrupt, but I
need your daughter alive.

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.531
What are you?

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.761
A chemist, a nihilist...

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:27.647
a capitalist, a mutation.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.765
A viper.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.809
Where is the security?

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:25.841
Yakuza.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.481
Shingen?

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.366
Logan.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.570
This. This here.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.324
Where is this?

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.568
Master Yashida's birthplace.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.410
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.406
How far?

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.646
500 kilometers from here.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.881
I gotta get that
thing out of me.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.400
How?

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.881
No, stop, Logan.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:38.044
I saw you die.
I'm never wrong.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.248
I'm never wrong.
You're not always right.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.736
You didn't know the old
man was gonna bite it.

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.816
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:45.729
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.288
I'm the only chance she's got, but
not with that thing inside me.

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.599
You're going to die, Logan.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.125
Maybe that's okay.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.403
No, listen to me, Logan!

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.562
No, stop. Logan!

01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:59.216
You're not gonna want to watch this part.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:01.766
No! Listen to me!
Please, no!

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.971
No, stop.
Listen to me.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.247
Logan!

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:17.087
Move!

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.839
Stay away from him.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.929
He killed your master.

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.331
Put hands on your sister.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.519
And now you want him?

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.043
Oh, no. I can't see.

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.849
You'll always be a beggar.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.040
You're crazy.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.327
Oh, no.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.806
Yukio.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.401
Logan!

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.682
Logan! Logan!

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:49.686
Logan!

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.048
Don't hit my friends.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.201
Where's Mariko?

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:41.204
She's gone. That Viper
bitch took her.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.681
It was my father's obsession...

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.210
with mutation,
with God's mistakes...

01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.884
like you and her,
that ruined this house.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.530
You tried to kill your daughter.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.645
Live with that.

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.650
What kind of monster are you?

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:32.090
The Wolverine.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.449
Hey, come here,
come here. That's it.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.121
I was wrong.

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.171
I told you.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.084
Let me have a look at you.

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.405
It's nothing.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.245
Hey, thank you.

01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:13.767
It's a trap, Logan.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.084
Why have you brought me here?

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.965
What are you hiding?

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.850
You will soon find out.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.088
Welcome, Mariko.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.449
It's all right, Mariko. She also
serves the House of Yashida.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.011
She serves herself.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.447
She infected Logan.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:52.921
Hmm...

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:54.321
And what about Grandfather?

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.930
What did you infect him with?

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.127
I granted his dying wish.

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.842
I helped him rest.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:09.281
Now, it's your turn.

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.885
Listen to me, mutant.
She will not be harmed.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.964
She will be fine.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.242
So long as you do your job.

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.090
Logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:58.887
It was easy to lure him here.

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.799
It's another thing
to capture him.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.883
We're ready. He's never
faced the Black Clan.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.806
Yes, well...

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:11.962
Dip your arrows in this.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.409
It won't kill him,

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.039
but it will slow him down.

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:18.166
Keep your potions.

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.921
He's no challenge
for us now. He's weak.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:22.881
Okay.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:27.929
But when you fail...

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.811
you have this.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.283
Did you have a nice rest?

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.839
I don't know
what you said or did

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.359
to deceive Harada
or my grandfather...

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:01.771
Now, now, calm down.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.922
Your grandfather sought me out.

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:06.124
I am the head
of this family now.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:12.971
And why do you suppose that is?

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.730
Why do you think
the old man chose you?

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.769
Because you are strong?

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:25.802
Or because you are weak?

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.644
I see you've come to fight.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:23.961
It's pointless.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.487
You're weak.
You're outnumbered.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.645
The Black Clan has protected the
House of Yashida for 700 years.

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.724
Is that all the men you brought?

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:38.650
I'm gonna get her.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.282
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.569
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.002
Go fuck yourself, pretty boy.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.001
Yukio, run!

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.446
Logan.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.285
<i>Logan.</i>

01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.447
<i>Kayla.</i>

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:40.721
<i>I love you.
Kayla!</i>

01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.205
<i>Logan.</i>

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.605
<i>- Logan!
- Mariko!</i>

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:51.561
Jean.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.011
<i>Save me.</i>

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.208
Stand back.
There is no need.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.329
Where is she?
Where's Mariko?

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:30.441
Where is she?

01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:33.522
"Where is Mariko?"

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.967
Still pining away?

01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.963
That's so sweet.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:41.003
Impressive, no?

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:44.847
He is made of adamantium,
just like you.

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:59.206
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:01.482
I know she's here.
I want to see her.

01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:03.806
You want answers.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.046
Yes, I want answers!

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.049
I'm sorry,
I wish I could say more,

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:10.049
but I was hired in
part for my discretion.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.200
I'm sure you were.

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:13.401
That“

01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:18.327
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:21.770
High-grade toxins
are my specialty.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:24.519
It helps to be
genetically immune

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.921
to every poison
known to man, as I am.

01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:31.891
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:34.371
as I am.

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.201
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.759
why don't you
open these bracelets

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.683
and we'll see
who's made of what?

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.959
The claws.
Now we can begin.

01:50:51.560 --> 01:50:53.847
I know you care for him.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.810
You need to let go of that.

01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:58.168
You are a Yashida.

01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.328
She betrayed my grandfather...

01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.091
and so have you.

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:03.720
No Mariko.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:05.723
We grew up together.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.411
You need to trust me.

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.363
Let me go to him!

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.000
He saved my life!

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.567
Let him go, Mariko!

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.080
This isn't easy for me but...

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.279
I'm following
Grandfather's wishes.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.762
The suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.

01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:26.691
You took it out on your own.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:29.682
I didn't see that coming.

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:31.530
The Viper woman is evil...

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:33.489
we both know that.

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.450
But she's a means to an end...

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:37.840
Where is she?

01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:39.639
An end your grandfather wanted.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:40.766
You are strong.

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.844
You have courage.

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:44.959
Real courage.

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:51.330
But that won't help much now.

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:05.806
What the...?

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.284
You need to trust me.

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.211
Is that hard?

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:13.531
We were meant to be together.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.048
We still can be.

01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.405
Perhaps.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:48.320
Stop!

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.561
This is madness.

01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.321
Let's go.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:06.241
Go!

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.399
Run!

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.250
Come on.

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.331
Mariko, come!
Go! Run!

01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:01.051
Mariko, get out!

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.485
Ahhh!

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.086
Come on.

01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.126
This is not the way.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.170
Two hands.

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:13.726
Master...

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.128
Hey! Bub!

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:44.840
Harada.

01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.845
I'm sorry.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.287
Now, you die.

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.445
Today is not my day.

01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:33.091
Hey!

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:41.930
Logan-<i>san.</i>

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:44.128
Don't look so shocked.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:50.366
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:53.171
Surely, I could survive this.

01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.644
It's all right.
It won't take long.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.204
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:05.041
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:10.127
We built it to make me strong, so I
can take what you would not give.

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:13.489
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:16.567
to my body.

02:00:18.840 --> 02:00:22.128
My legacy must be preserved.

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.407
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:27.846
can have no meaning.

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:33.650
It is the only life that can.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.525
Hold on.

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:38.523
We are almost there.

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.685
The peace,
the peace you've wanted.

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:45.322
Your reward.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.163
You know, I'm giving
you the very death...

02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:51.882
you longed for.

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:05.727
This feeling...

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.406
to be invincible...

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.729
like you.

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.727
You are a monster.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.321
Mariko.

02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:33.560
It's me.
Your grandfather.

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.004
I buried my grandfather.

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:42.811
You asked me to
come say goodbye.

02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.169
Sayonara.

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.363
Are you all right?

02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.681
Logan.

02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.689
Logan.

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:35.886
Logan.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.485
You're here.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:53.404
Of course.

02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:57.008
Can you stay?

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.202
I can't.

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:05.244
Yes, you can.

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:09.247
This is what you wanted.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.725
Not anymore.

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:20.246
I'm all alone here.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.608
You put me here.

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:30.926
You were hurting people, Jean.

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.650
I had to.

02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.322
I love you, Jean.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.683
I always will.

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.250
You are my only family.

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:35.167
Be well, sister.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:51.809
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.646
Stay.

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.810
I can't, princess.

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.239
I'm a soldier,

02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:12.004
and I've been hiding too long.

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:28.371
<i>In our business
profile tonight, Mariko Yashida.</i>

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.330
<i>A two-generation passing of the
torch in the Yashida family...</i>

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.319
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,</i>

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:35.481
<i>who built this tech giant.</i>

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:37.799
I know
it will always be the purpose

02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.882
for a corporation
to make a profit...

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:44.329
but Yashida Industries believes we
can also work with our community.

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:52.847
So, have you decided?

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:56.560
What?

02:06:56.760 --> 02:06:59.047
Mariko says we can
go wherever we want.

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:00.929
Just say where.

02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.491
What are you doing?

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:07.409
I'm your bodyguard.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.650
So, where do you want to go?

02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:16.927
Uh...

02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:19.403
Let's just start with up.

02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:21.210
And then?

02:07:25.240 --> 02:07:26.924
We'll see.

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.606
Interesting.

02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:24.282
<i>With cutting edge technology,</i>

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.368
<i>and the world's leading minds...</i>

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.090
<i>we are on the frontlines...</i>

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:31.489
<i>keeping you healthy,
keeping you safe.</i>

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.002
<i>Trask Industries.</i>

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:36.487
<i>Solving tomorrow's
problems, today.</i>

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:38.765
I'll take the pat-down.

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:39.921
Opt out.

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:54.119
You can go ahead, sir.

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:55.246
I'll wait.

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.330
What do you want?

02:10:07.080 --> 02:10:09.606
There are dark forces,
Wolverine.

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.362
Human forces
building a weapon...

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.922
that could bring about
the end of our kind.

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.889
What do I want?
I want your help.

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:24.964
Why would I trust you?

02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.451
You wouldn't.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:53.451
Hello, Logan.

02:10:57.760 --> 02:10:59.649
How is this possible?

02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:02.565
As I told you a long time ago...

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:06.479
you are not
the only one with gifts.
