WEBVTT

00:01:09.988 --> 00:01:14.784
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.287
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:19.414
And I would expect you, of all people,

00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:22.167
would understand
my feelings on misuse of power.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:26.337
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

00:01:26.504 --> 00:01:30.008
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:32.510
You're here because I need you.

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.305
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:39.184
No. This one's special.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.354
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.024
Yeah, the brochure is great.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:50.028
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:52.530
- Illness?
- John.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:54.866
You think your daughter is sick, Mr Grey?

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:58.745
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:01.247
Of course.

00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:04.000
Jean, can you come down, dear?

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.055
We'll leave you, then.

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:31.069
<i>It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr Lensherr's, without our permission.</i>

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:34.781
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

00:02:34.948 --> 00:02:38.243
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.372
Really? I doubt that.

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:01.099
Oh, Charles.

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:04.269
I like this one.

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:06.896
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.817
The question is,
will you control that power?

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:15.780
Or let it control you?

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:39.554
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:44.142
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.812
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

00:03:48.688 --> 00:03:51.024
Open the door. Warren.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.318
One second!

00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.655
Open this door.

00:03:57.822 --> 00:03:59.449
Warren.

00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.329
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.471
Oh, God.

00:04:21.638 --> 00:04:24.974
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

00:05:52.186 --> 00:05:55.857
The whole world's going to hell and
you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

00:06:07.618 --> 00:06:09.287
Bobby!

00:06:15.752 --> 00:06:18.212
Thanks, Kitty.

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:29.307
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:33.644
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:39.150
That was my last cigar.

00:06:39.317 --> 00:06:40.985
Logan.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.491
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:49.202
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:53.039
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:56.209
Yeah. Good luck with that.
Throw me. Now.

00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:59.670
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:19.190
Class dismissed.

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:24.529
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:29.784
<i>Simulation complete.</i>

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:36.374
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:38.292
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:41.546
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:44.715
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:48.678
Yeah, best defense is a good offense.
Or is it the other way round?

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.807
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:57.353
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.455
- Scott!
- Jean.

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:18.958
Scott. Scott.

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.252
Scott.

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.546
Scott.

00:08:24.422 --> 00:08:26.716
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

00:08:28.426 --> 00:08:31.304
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.600
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:39.103
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.858
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:48.613
They were looking for you.
You didn't show.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:49.780
What do you care?

00:08:49.947 --> 00:08:53.034
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:55.244
No, you didn't. The professor did.

00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.873
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.125
Hey, look.

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:06.214
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:11.302
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:18.267
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

00:09:40.164 --> 00:09:42.625
- Mr Secretary.
- Yes.

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:48.172
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:55.304
Mr President.

00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:57.515
Have a seat, Hank.

00:09:58.975 --> 00:10:02.019
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:05.690
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:10.861
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

00:10:11.028 --> 00:10:13.698
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:17.243
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.413
Yes, sir. She can do that.

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:24.583
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.379
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:30.715
<i>Where is Magneto?</i>

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:33.384
<i>Raven?</i>

00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:38.097
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

00:10:38.264 --> 00:10:41.350
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

00:10:41.517 --> 00:10:44.895
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:49.066
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

00:10:49.984 --> 00:10:53.070
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

00:10:56.866 --> 00:10:58.909
In here with us.

00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:02.997
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:05.624
You don't want to play games with me?

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:10.379
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

00:11:11.422 --> 00:11:13.716
You wanna know where he is?

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:23.726
Homo sapien.

00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:32.318
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:35.446
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

00:11:35.613 --> 00:11:39.450
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

00:11:39.617 --> 00:11:43.954
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:47.625
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.586
It's what she stole from the FDA.

00:11:56.592 --> 00:11:58.636
Dear Lord.

00:12:00.262 --> 00:12:03.057
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:08.687
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:14.652
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

00:12:18.364 --> 00:12:21.242
When an individual acquires great power,

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:25.204
the use or misuse of that power
is everything.

00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:32.002
Will it be for the greater good or will it be
used for personal or for destructive ends?

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.839
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.675
Why? Because we are mutants.

00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:40.553
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:45.182
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

00:12:45.349 --> 00:12:47.977
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:51.981
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

00:12:52.148 --> 00:12:54.400
without any superhuman authority behind it.

00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:58.112
Einstein wasn't a mutant
so far as we know.

00:13:00.531 --> 00:13:05.286
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr Moira McTaggert. Jones.

00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:09.290
<i>The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.</i>

00:13:09.457 --> 00:13:14.211
<i>His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.</i>

00:13:14.378 --> 00:13:18.048
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:21.302
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:23.888
into the body of this man?

00:13:24.054 --> 00:13:29.852
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:44.450
Professor?

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:50.581
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

00:13:57.755 --> 00:14:00.216
The forecast was for sunny skies.

00:14:01.926 --> 00:14:03.969
I'm sorry.

00:14:12.937 --> 00:14:16.982
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.861
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

00:14:21.028 --> 00:14:24.990
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:29.954
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.165
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:36.377
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

00:14:36.544 --> 00:14:42.007
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.347
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

00:14:48.514 --> 00:14:51.100
He took Jean's death so hard.

00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:53.310
Yes, things are better out there,

00:14:53.477 --> 00:14:57.481
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:01.235
There's something you're not telling us.

00:15:10.119 --> 00:15:11.996
Hank?

00:15:12.162 --> 00:15:14.248
Ororo. Charles.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:19.753
I love what you've done with your hair.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.674
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:27.428
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

00:15:27.595 --> 00:15:29.763
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.017
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:37.688
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

00:15:37.855 --> 00:15:40.232
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:43.152
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:45.904
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:49.366
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:51.535
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

00:15:51.702 --> 00:15:55.456
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:59.084
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:02.046
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:05.257
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

00:16:05.424 --> 00:16:08.052
They're calling it a cure.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.308
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:17.686
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

00:16:17.853 --> 00:16:19.897
Storm.

00:16:20.064 --> 00:16:22.399
They're announcing it now.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.908
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

00:16:31.075 --> 00:16:34.078
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:37.247
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

00:16:37.414 --> 00:16:40.709
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:44.004
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

00:16:44.171 --> 00:16:48.092
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.427
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.723
<i>I proudly present the answer to mutation.</i>

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.185
<i>Finally, we have a cure.</i>

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:06.485
Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind
of coward would take it just to fit in?

00:17:06.652 --> 00:17:10.989
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:13.158
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:18.163
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.750
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:26.630
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant
rights since before you had claws.

00:17:26.797 --> 00:17:30.926
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.304
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:39.017
No. Professor.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.270
They can't cure us.

00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:47.359
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:49.987
Or any of us, for that matter.

00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:55.868
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

00:17:56.034 --> 00:18:01.165
This is about getting organized. Bringing
our complaints to the right people.

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:05.836
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:11.008
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:17.014
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

00:18:18.724 --> 00:18:23.020
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.690
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

00:18:26.857 --> 00:18:29.318
Nobody is talking about extermination.

00:18:29.485 --> 00:18:32.112
No one ever talks about it.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.200
They just do it.

00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:42.456
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:48.337
And then one day, when the air is still and
the night has fallen, they come for you.

00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:52.257
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:54.551
the extermination has already begun.

00:18:54.718 --> 00:18:59.264
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:02.392
They will force their cure upon us.

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:08.106
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.443
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.738
Who will you stand with? The humans?

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.408
Or us?

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:30.420
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:32.673
Back off.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.010
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

00:19:38.554 --> 00:19:41.682
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.768
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

00:19:44.935 --> 00:19:47.646
You know who you're talking to?

00:19:47.813 --> 00:19:49.898
Do you?

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.611
And what can you do?

00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.948
So you have talents?

00:19:58.115 --> 00:20:01.118
That and more. I know you control metal.

00:20:01.285 --> 00:20:05.289
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.541
Other than you two.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:13.297
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:17.426
Could you locate one for me?

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:40.449
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

00:20:40.616 --> 00:20:44.161
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

00:20:44.328 --> 00:20:46.038
Oh, Mr President.

00:20:46.204 --> 00:20:48.290
Shut up.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:56.173
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.883
Please.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.845
Keep it up. I'll spray
you in the face, bitch.

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:07.768
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:10.020
Yeah, right.

00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:41.385
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:43.804
Thank you, Dr Rae.
Not an easy mace to get to.

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:48.642
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

00:21:49.393 --> 00:21:52.229
He is a mutant.
You understand our concern.

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:56.900
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:00.904
Until we can fully map his DNA. We can
replicate it, but we can't generate it.

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.407
And his power? What is its range?

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.659
You'll see.

00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:11.248
Jimmy.

00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:14.918
There's someone I would like you to meet.

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:17.004
Hello there, son.

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:20.090
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.224
I'm sorry.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.227
It's OK.

00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:45.115
You have an amazing gift.
Thank you, Jimmy.

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:57.252
Extraordinary, isn't he?

00:22:58.336 --> 00:23:00.464
Yes, he is.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.377
Scott.

00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:51.014
Scott.

00:23:51.765 --> 00:23:53.391
Scott.

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:57.646
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

00:23:57.813 --> 00:24:00.190
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

00:24:00.357 --> 00:24:03.026
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

00:24:03.193 --> 00:24:05.529
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

00:24:05.695 --> 00:24:08.448
Stop!

00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:06.840
Jean?

00:25:08.258 --> 00:25:09.551
Scott.

00:25:12.637 --> 00:25:14.055
How?

00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:20.937
I don't know.

00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:37.871
I wanna see your eyes.

00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:42.125
- Take these off.
- No.

00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:46.046
No.

00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:48.924
Trust me. I can control it now.

00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:59.768
Open them. You can't hurt me.

00:26:35.553 --> 00:26:38.390
- What happened?
- No clue.

00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:42.143
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

00:27:10.588 --> 00:27:13.967
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

00:27:37.073 --> 00:27:39.409
I can't see a damn thing.

00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:41.911
I can take care of that.

00:27:58.219 --> 00:28:00.263
What the...

00:28:34.464 --> 00:28:36.758
Logan!

00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:44.307
She's alive.

00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:50.021
Jean.

00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:58.738
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:01.074
The only explanation of Jean's survival

00:29:01.241 --> 00:29:06.329
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

00:29:08.331 --> 00:29:09.833
Is she gonna be OK?

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:15.588
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've
ever encountered, her potential limitless.

00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:20.468
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:25.014
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:27.684
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:33.857
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

00:29:34.023 --> 00:29:39.904
The conscious Jean, whose powers were always
in her control, and the dormant side.

00:29:40.071 --> 00:29:46.035
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

00:29:46.661 --> 00:29:52.459
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

00:29:53.918 --> 00:29:57.881
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

00:29:58.047 --> 00:30:03.219
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:06.764
or the Phoenix furiously struggling
to be free.

00:30:06.931 --> 00:30:09.809
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:15.440
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

00:30:15.607 --> 00:30:17.901
What have you done to her?

00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:21.571
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

00:30:21.738 --> 00:30:24.657
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:28.244
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:32.540
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

00:30:32.707 --> 00:30:35.585
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

00:30:35.752 --> 00:30:39.255
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:43.426
It sounds to me like Jean
had no choice at all.

00:30:43.593 --> 00:30:47.972
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

00:30:55.939 --> 00:30:58.608
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:02.111
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:05.490
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

00:31:05.657 --> 00:31:11.913
Some are desperate for this cure while
others are offended by the very idea of it.

00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:27.178
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:32.517
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

00:31:32.684 --> 00:31:35.645
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

00:31:36.479 --> 00:31:38.314
Good. Bring him in.

00:31:38.481 --> 00:31:40.650
Are you sure you want to start with him?

00:31:40.817 --> 00:31:43.278
I think it's important. Yes.

00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:47.156
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

00:31:47.323 --> 00:31:49.701
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:52.662
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

00:31:52.829 --> 00:31:56.332
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

00:31:58.835 --> 00:32:00.878
You ready?

00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:33.161
The transformation can be a little jarring.

00:32:37.206 --> 00:32:40.877
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:42.837
It'll all be over soon.

00:32:44.213 --> 00:32:49.886
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

00:32:50.053 --> 00:32:51.888
Warren, calm down.

00:32:52.055 --> 00:32:54.098
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:57.310
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

00:32:57.477 --> 00:33:01.314
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

00:33:09.364 --> 00:33:11.324
Warren, it's a better life.

00:33:12.533 --> 00:33:15.119
- It's what we all want.
- No.

00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:18.539
It's what you want.

00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.086
Warren, no!

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.911
Told you so.

00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:56.012
About time.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:59.599
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:03.519
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

00:35:03.686 --> 00:35:06.355
Without him, they have nothing.

00:35:06.522 --> 00:35:08.524
Read off the guest list.

00:35:09.734 --> 00:35:13.863
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:16.032
This one robbed seven banks.

00:35:22.038 --> 00:35:26.042
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.837
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

00:35:33.216 --> 00:35:37.553
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.641
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

00:35:41.808 --> 00:35:45.228
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

00:35:45.394 --> 00:35:47.897
How fascinating.

00:35:49.357 --> 00:35:52.235
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:56.405
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:11.420
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:16.759
I think he'll make a fine addition
to our army.

00:36:16.926 --> 00:36:18.928
No!

00:36:43.786 --> 00:36:46.289
You saved me.

00:36:50.084 --> 00:36:51.794
Eric.

00:36:54.171 --> 00:36:56.966
I'm sorry, my dear.

00:36:57.133 --> 00:36:59.594
You're not one of us any more.

00:37:05.308 --> 00:37:08.311
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

00:37:14.483 --> 00:37:18.321
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

00:37:18.487 --> 00:37:21.073
Policy is being made without me,
Mr President.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.327
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

00:37:24.493 --> 00:37:28.164
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:30.041
That was an isolated incident.

00:37:30.207 --> 00:37:33.502
You have to understand
those mutants were a real threat.

00:37:33.669 --> 00:37:37.882
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

00:37:38.049 --> 00:37:40.217
I have.

00:37:41.844 --> 00:37:44.138
And I worry about how democracy survives

00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:46.849
when one man can move cities
with his mind.

00:37:47.016 --> 00:37:49.018
As do I.

00:37:52.355 --> 00:37:54.982
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:59.362
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

00:38:27.139 --> 00:38:28.808
Jean.

00:38:33.229 --> 00:38:36.148
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

00:38:39.151 --> 00:38:44.907
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:47.868
Are you OK?

00:38:49.578 --> 00:38:51.664
Yeah.

00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:55.918
More than OK.

00:39:08.055 --> 00:39:10.766
Logan, you're making me blush.

00:39:12.184 --> 00:39:15.271
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:20.860
It's OK.

00:39:35.207 --> 00:39:37.293
It's OK.

00:40:15.998 --> 00:40:18.584
- Wait.
- No.

00:40:24.048 --> 00:40:25.674
Jean.

00:40:25.841 --> 00:40:28.844
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:32.014
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:38.187
The professor said you might be different.

00:40:40.147 --> 00:40:42.525
He would know, wouldn't he?

00:40:42.691 --> 00:40:46.362
What? You think he's not in your head too?

00:40:46.529 --> 00:40:50.950
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

00:40:55.412 --> 00:40:57.540
Where's Scott?

00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:03.003
Jean?

00:41:03.921 --> 00:41:07.216
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

00:41:08.384 --> 00:41:11.303
You need to tell me
what happened to Scott.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.393
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

00:41:29.405 --> 00:41:30.906
Oh, God.

00:41:38.747 --> 00:41:41.250
Look at me.

00:41:43.836 --> 00:41:47.131
Stay with me. Talk to me.

00:41:47.298 --> 00:41:49.091
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

00:41:49.258 --> 00:41:51.051
Focus. Focus, Jean.

00:41:52.887 --> 00:41:55.598
Kill me.

00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.434
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

00:41:58.601 --> 00:42:00.144
- Don't say that.
- Please.

00:42:00.311 --> 00:42:02.771
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:07.276
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

00:42:07.443 --> 00:42:10.070
It'll be all right. We can help you.

00:42:10.738 --> 00:42:13.657
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

00:42:13.824 --> 00:42:15.743
I don't want to fix it.

00:42:27.004 --> 00:42:30.799
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:34.386
I told you they would draw first blood.

00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:37.056
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

00:42:37.223 --> 00:42:43.145
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

00:42:43.812 --> 00:42:46.398
Come. We have an army to build.

00:42:49.652 --> 00:42:51.654
I picked something up.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.990
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

00:42:55.157 --> 00:42:57.534
It's a mutant.

00:42:57.701 --> 00:43:01.789
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

00:43:01.956 --> 00:43:04.166
More powerful than you.

00:43:07.336 --> 00:43:09.129
Where is she?

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.218
Logan.

00:43:14.385 --> 00:43:16.428
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

00:43:16.595 --> 00:43:18.681
What have you done?

00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:26.063
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

00:43:27.982 --> 00:43:31.193
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

00:43:36.699 --> 00:43:42.955
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

00:43:44.206 --> 00:43:46.041
It may be too late.

00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:52.589
- Wait for me here.
- What?

00:43:52.756 --> 00:43:54.842
I need to see Jean alone.

00:43:55.551 --> 00:43:57.720
You were right, Charles.

00:43:57.886 --> 00:44:01.223
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.268
Same as the professor.
Visiting an old friend.

00:44:04.435 --> 00:44:06.603
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.856
So, shall we go inside?

00:44:11.233 --> 00:44:13.610
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:18.866
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:22.745
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:24.913
Nobody gets inside.

00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:15.214
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

00:45:15.381 --> 00:45:17.466
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do.

00:45:17.633 --> 00:45:19.134
You have a home and a family.

00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:22.805
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

00:45:22.971 --> 00:45:26.850
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

00:45:27.017 --> 00:45:29.812
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

00:45:29.978 --> 00:45:31.980
No. I want to help you.

00:45:32.773 --> 00:45:36.318
Help me? What's wrong with me?

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.320
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

00:45:38.487 --> 00:45:41.448
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

00:45:41.615 --> 00:45:44.159
For your own good, Jean.

00:45:44.785 --> 00:45:47.121
Stay out of my head.

00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:53.836
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

00:46:00.134 --> 00:46:04.054
Look at me, Jean. I can help you.
Look at me.

00:46:04.221 --> 00:46:06.140
Get out of my head.

00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:12.729
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

00:46:12.896 --> 00:46:16.191
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

00:46:16.358 --> 00:46:20.529
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

00:46:20.696 --> 00:46:22.990
No! Stop it!

00:46:25.492 --> 00:46:27.703
That's it.

00:47:09.703 --> 00:47:12.164
Jean, let me in.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.520
No, Jean.

00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:18.772
Jean!

00:49:17.539 --> 00:49:19.875
Don't let it control you.

00:49:28.925 --> 00:49:30.636
Charles.

00:49:57.412 --> 00:50:00.374
My dear. Come with me.

00:50:14.971 --> 00:50:17.099
No.

00:50:20.268 --> 00:50:21.770
God!

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.975
We live in an age of darkness.

00:51:00.142 --> 00:51:04.813
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

00:51:05.689 --> 00:51:09.985
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

00:51:10.152 --> 00:51:13.822
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

00:51:15.323 --> 00:51:17.826
A world he tried to heal.

00:51:18.827 --> 00:51:21.621
A mission he never saw accomplished.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:27.502
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

00:51:27.669 --> 00:51:32.841
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

00:51:33.675 --> 00:51:36.511
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

00:51:37.179 --> 00:51:40.515
And when we were alone,
he gave us a family.

00:51:41.725 --> 00:51:48.815
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

00:51:48.982 --> 00:51:52.360
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

00:51:52.527 --> 00:51:56.490
And that's a vision of a world united.

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.557
Kitty.

00:52:23.558 --> 00:52:25.602
Bobby.

00:52:28.522 --> 00:52:30.565
- You OK?
- Yeah.

00:52:34.694 --> 00:52:38.740
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

00:52:40.242 --> 00:52:42.953
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:45.121
Yeah, me too.

00:52:45.288 --> 00:52:49.417
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

00:52:49.584 --> 00:52:51.670
You have Rogue and I have...

00:52:53.547 --> 00:52:55.799
You know, I just miss home.

00:52:57.425 --> 00:52:59.761
The first snow and all that.

00:53:02.264 --> 00:53:05.600
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

00:53:05.767 --> 00:53:08.144
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

00:53:08.311 --> 00:53:10.939
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

00:53:11.106 --> 00:53:12.691
Come on.

00:53:24.786 --> 00:53:27.122
This place can be home too.

00:54:06.369 --> 00:54:09.331
Thank you for this, Bobby.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.766
You need a lift, kid?

00:54:27.933 --> 00:54:30.018
No.

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.105
Where are you going?

00:54:35.607 --> 00:54:38.193
You don't know what it's like
to be afraid of your powers,

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.236
afraid to get close to anybody.

00:54:40.403 --> 00:54:42.697
Yeah, I do.

00:54:43.907 --> 00:54:47.535
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

00:54:47.702 --> 00:54:51.122
A hug. A handshake.

00:54:51.289 --> 00:54:53.208
A kiss.

00:54:53.375 --> 00:54:56.878
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

00:54:58.546 --> 00:55:01.049
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

00:55:01.883 --> 00:55:04.636
Just be sure it's what you want.

00:55:06.054 --> 00:55:08.723
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.934
To go upstairs and unpack?

00:55:11.101 --> 00:55:14.270
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

00:55:16.523 --> 00:55:19.401
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

00:55:19.567 --> 00:55:21.069
Marie.

00:55:22.362 --> 00:55:24.489
Marie.

00:56:02.444 --> 00:56:08.783
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:14.956
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

00:56:16.458 --> 00:56:19.127
And I thought to myself,
"Why would Charles

00:56:19.294 --> 00:56:22.922
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

00:56:27.302 --> 00:56:31.139
I can manipulate the metal in this,

00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:34.809
but you, you can do anything.

00:56:34.976 --> 00:56:37.228
Anything you can think of.

00:56:47.822 --> 00:56:49.866
Jean.

00:56:50.033 --> 00:56:52.118
Enough.

00:56:53.995 --> 00:56:55.538
Enough.

00:56:57.874 --> 00:57:00.126
You sound just like him.

00:57:00.293 --> 00:57:03.171
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:07.342
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

00:57:08.259 --> 00:57:10.345
As nature intended.

00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:18.353
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

00:57:19.687 --> 00:57:21.981
And that fight begins now.

00:57:30.573 --> 00:57:33.284
She shouldn't be here with us.

00:57:33.451 --> 00:57:37.205
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

00:57:37.372 --> 00:57:40.750
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:46.714
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:50.885
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

00:57:51.052 --> 00:57:56.891
My single greatest regret is that he
had to die for our dream to live.

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.702
So what now? What do we do?

00:58:15.869 --> 00:58:19.330
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

00:58:19.497 --> 00:58:25.336
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

00:58:25.503 --> 00:58:31.259
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

00:58:36.347 --> 00:58:38.933
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.438
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

00:58:43.605 --> 00:58:45.607
It was, son.

00:58:49.277 --> 00:58:53.448
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

00:58:53.615 --> 00:58:57.452
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:13.635
Rogue.

00:59:14.594 --> 00:59:16.638
Hey, Rogue.

00:59:25.772 --> 00:59:30.151
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

00:59:43.456 --> 00:59:45.667
Logan.

00:59:45.833 --> 00:59:47.335
Logan.

00:59:47.502 --> 00:59:49.170
- Logan.
- Jean?

00:59:49.921 --> 00:59:52.173
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.175
Logan. Logan.

00:59:54.342 --> 00:59:56.594
- Logan.
- Stop.

00:59:56.761 --> 00:59:59.055
Logan. Logan. Logan.

01:00:19.951 --> 01:00:22.578
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:26.541
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:29.085
She killed the professor.

01:00:29.252 --> 01:00:32.547
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.884
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:40.722
Why can't you just let her go?

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.890
Because you love her.

01:00:52.734 --> 01:00:55.445
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:58.781
So if you're with us, then be with us.

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:15.089
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:18.760
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:21.721
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:01:22.013 --> 01:01:25.683
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:01:26.893 --> 01:01:32.440
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

01:01:32.607 --> 01:01:35.234
I'm looking for someone.

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:39.572
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

01:01:40.907 --> 01:01:44.952
I figured she'd want the cure.
She's pathetic.

01:01:49.082 --> 01:01:51.125
Come on, Iceman.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.921
Make a move.

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:03.971
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:19.487
<i>Today's attack was only our first salvo.</i>

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:23.491
<i>So long as the cure exists,
our war will rage.</i>

01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:29.997
<i>Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.</i>

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:34.001
<i>And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...</i>

01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.838
<i>Join us or stay out of our way.</i>

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:41.008
<i>Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.</i>

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:45.263
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

01:02:47.974 --> 01:02:51.894
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

01:02:52.061 --> 01:02:56.190
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:59.861
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:06.200
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:09.537
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:12.290
Let's go. Keep it moving.

01:03:12.457 --> 01:03:16.043
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.714
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:24.010
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:26.137
Absolutely no metal.

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:40.735
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:03:41.027 --> 01:03:45.573
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:51.913
We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure!

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:15.389
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:23.689
The cure for that infirm, imperfect
condition called homo sapiens.

01:06:25.858 --> 01:06:27.943
They have their weapons.

01:06:28.903 --> 01:06:31.030
We have ours.

01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:39.413
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

01:06:40.706 --> 01:06:47.088
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.508
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

01:06:50.675 --> 01:06:52.802
take control of the cure,

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:55.304
and destroy its source.

01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:59.141
And then nothing can stop us.

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:16.158
Jean.

01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:31.841
I know the smell of your adamantium
from a mile away.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:34.885
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

01:07:35.052 --> 01:07:39.598
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:53.154
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.907
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

01:07:57.074 --> 01:08:00.494
And you stood there and let him die?

01:08:00.661 --> 01:08:04.165
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

01:08:17.678 --> 01:08:19.805
OK.

01:08:20.681 --> 01:08:24.518
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr President.

01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:30.566
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:37.198
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

01:08:38.324 --> 01:08:41.535
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:18.989
Approaching target dead ahead.

01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:22.910
Set for 360-degree incursion.

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:39.009
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

01:09:43.597 --> 01:09:45.766
OK, send them in.

01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:47.017
OK.

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:51.605
Freeze, mutants! Get your hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:08.789
OK. I give up.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:12.042
Sorry, Mr Secretary, it was a decoy.

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:15.087
If he's not there, then
where the hell is he?

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:27.516
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:30.978
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

01:10:31.145 --> 01:10:34.773
So how are we supposed to get there?
Cos I don't swim.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:37.568
Leave that to me.

01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:45.743
Storm. Storm.

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:48.662
What are you doing back here?

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:50.748
I need help.

01:10:50.915 --> 01:10:53.667
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:56.670
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

01:10:56.837 --> 01:10:59.506
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go.

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:02.009
They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

01:11:02.176 --> 01:11:05.596
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

01:11:05.763 --> 01:11:07.848
Let's suit up.

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:13.604
Hard to believe this once fit me.

01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:16.065
If Magneto gets that cure,
we can't stop him.

01:11:16.231 --> 01:11:19.193
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.032
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

01:11:26.617 --> 01:11:29.036
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

01:11:29.203 --> 01:11:31.705
I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:34.124
But we lost Scott.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.377
We lost the professor.

01:11:36.543 --> 01:11:41.382
If we don't fight now, everything
they stood for will die with them.

01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:44.385
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.553
Are you?

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:49.765
Then we stand together.

01:11:51.058 --> 01:11:53.394
X-Men.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.646
All of us.

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:04.530
We're in.

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:06.740
Let's go.

01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:13.706
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:20.045
But are you ready to do what
you need to do when the time comes?

01:13:47.132 --> 01:13:49.635
Dad, what's going on?

01:13:50.928 --> 01:13:53.013
It's an earthquake.

01:13:56.475 --> 01:13:58.977
We're trapped.

01:16:02.309 --> 01:16:06.104
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:23.413
My God.

01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:51.525
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:10.877
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

01:17:11.044 --> 01:17:14.381
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:33.984
In chess, the pawns go first.

01:17:36.695 --> 01:17:39.156
Humans and their guns.

01:17:48.123 --> 01:17:50.917
Plastic. They've learned.

01:17:57.132 --> 01:17:59.885
That's why the pawns go first.

01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:12.272
Target the bridge.

01:18:18.779 --> 01:18:20.572
Fire!

01:18:27.454 --> 01:18:32.250
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

01:18:51.978 --> 01:18:56.149
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:02.656
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

01:19:02.823 --> 01:19:06.618
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

01:19:07.494 --> 01:19:09.454
Then God help us.

01:19:19.297 --> 01:19:21.341
They're coming for him.

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.043
Don't ever do that again.

01:20:04.176 --> 01:20:06.303
You men cover the doors!

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:09.639
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

01:20:25.447 --> 01:20:28.158
Traitors to their own cause.

01:20:34.414 --> 01:20:37.000
Finish them!

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.870
Not yet.

01:21:28.718 --> 01:21:31.388
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

01:21:31.555 --> 01:21:33.640
With pleasure.

01:21:39.437 --> 01:21:42.148
Hold it!

01:21:43.984 --> 01:21:45.986
He's going for the boy!

01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:48.321
Not if I get there first.

01:21:48.488 --> 01:21:50.532
Kitty!

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.961
Come on.

01:22:06.047 --> 01:22:08.008
Grow those back.

01:22:18.685 --> 01:22:20.770
Don't you know who I am?

01:22:21.688 --> 01:22:24.357
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

01:22:56.222 --> 01:22:57.891
Going somewhere?

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.397
You're the guy that invented the cure,
right?

01:23:04.564 --> 01:23:06.566
Yes, I am.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.110
Girls.

01:23:09.277 --> 01:23:11.571
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

01:23:11.738 --> 01:23:14.908
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

01:23:15.075 --> 01:23:17.243
Calm down. Calm down.

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:19.621
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:23:37.597 --> 01:23:42.394
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:46.272
Oh, you get the point.

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:49.484
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:50.944
No.

01:23:57.075 --> 01:24:01.871
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

01:24:03.289 --> 01:24:05.500
This way.

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:10.463
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:16.553
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:22.308
I'm the wrong guy
to play hide-and-seek with.

01:24:22.475 --> 01:24:24.811
Who's hiding, dickhead?

01:24:36.406 --> 01:24:38.324
Don't. No.

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:40.869
Don't.

01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:44.831
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

01:24:45.665 --> 01:24:48.001
Do we look like we need your help?

01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:20.200
It's time to end this war.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.963
Take cover.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.258
Get out of the way.

01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:52.106
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:53.733
Go! Go! Go!

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:44.117
We work as a team.

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:48.413
Best defense is a good offense.

01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:56.921
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

01:27:10.476 --> 01:27:12.604
Go ahead.

01:27:13.813 --> 01:27:16.316
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

01:27:16.482 --> 01:27:18.484
Right.

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:10.078
You're in over your head, Bobby.

01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:13.206
Maybe you should go back to school.

01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:26.219
You never should have left.

01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:29.722
This is it.

01:28:29.889 --> 01:28:31.808
Hey.

01:28:31.975 --> 01:28:34.894
Make it a strike.

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:48.074
You never learn, do you?

01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:53.246
Actually, I do.

01:29:06.718 --> 01:29:08.845
I'm...

01:29:09.012 --> 01:29:11.723
One of them?

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:25.111
This is what they want for all of us.

01:29:46.132 --> 01:29:47.925
It's over, Jean.

01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:52.597
It's over.

01:29:55.767 --> 01:29:57.643
No! Don't shoot!

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.325
No!

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:32.637
Everybody get out of there!

01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:43.356
Bobby!

01:30:53.407 --> 01:30:55.535
What have I done?

01:31:06.295 --> 01:31:10.591
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

01:31:10.758 --> 01:31:13.136
Go.

01:31:16.806 --> 01:31:18.391
Jean!

01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:05.771
Jean!

01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:08.274
I know you're still there!

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.448
You would die for them?

01:32:58.616 --> 01:33:00.618
No, not for them.

01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:03.996
For you.

01:33:05.915 --> 01:33:08.000
For you.

01:33:12.964 --> 01:33:15.007
Save me.

01:33:16.842 --> 01:33:18.094
I love you.

01:34:57.902 --> 01:35:00.446
You're back.

01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:09.330
I'm sorry.

01:35:09.497 --> 01:35:11.540
I had to.

01:35:12.333 --> 01:35:15.419
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:18.964
It's what I want.

01:35:31.185 --> 01:35:32.853
Hey.

01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:36.023
Good to see you, buddy.

01:35:36.190 --> 01:35:38.818
<i>With the thanks of a grateful nation</i>

01:35:38.984 --> 01:35:42.154
<i>I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,</i>

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:46.450
<i>and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,</i>

01:35:46.617 --> 01:35:49.370
<i>human and mutant alike,</i>

01:35:49.537 --> 01:35:51.622
<i>Dr Hank McCoy.</i>

01:35:54.708 --> 01:35:56.919
Way to go, fur ball.

01:43:45.596 --> 01:43:47.639
Morning.

01:43:51.977 --> 01:43:54.813
Hello, Moira.

01:44:01.153 --> 01:44:02.738
Charles.
