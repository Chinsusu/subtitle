WEBVTT

00:00:58.143 --> 00:00:59.783
<i>We get the wheels,
we get</i> la feria,

00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:01.811
<i>we keep moving on.
No messing around.</i>

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.040
<i>You mess those wheels up
this time, Chong,</i>

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:04.074
<i>I'm gonna have your ass.</i>

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.149
<i>Move!</i>

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:08.017
<i>- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.</i>

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:09.296
<i>Where's your party, boy?</i>

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.780
<i>Turn down the radio.</i>

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.347
You inviting the cops, too,
or what?

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:13.487
I want <i>El cromo.</i>

00:01:15.118 --> 00:01:16.578
Gonna get some green

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.161
for this shit right here, homes.

00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.831
Fuck.

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:25.169
Hey.

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:41.443
Uh, guys?

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:45.107
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:46.393
Look at this guy, eh?

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.111
The plating flakes off.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:49.356
Yeah?

00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:51.327
This is a lease.
No one's gonna pay to ride...

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.501
Shit.

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:11.126
Come on, man.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.180
Uh, guys, guys.

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:18.517
What the fuck?

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.233
Guys, seriously,
you don't wanna do this.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.234
Take him out.

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:34.072
Fuck him up!

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.577
No! Not the car!

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.709
Get that <i>puto!</i>

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:51.086
Fuck him up, man!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.550
Fuck him up!

00:02:57.262 --> 00:02:58.432
Get him!

00:02:58.596 --> 00:02:59.886
Hit that fool!

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:06.024
Motherfucker!

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:37.637
Shit.

00:03:58.573 --> 00:03:59.873
Fuck.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.285
<i>Everyone's asleep, Burt.</i>

00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.207
<i>Sleepwalking.
Between the ice caps,</i>

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.665
<i>the pornographers,
poisoned water, mutants...</i>

00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:58.295
<i>it's all connected.</i>

00:04:58.383 --> 00:05:00.803
<i>Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.</i>

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.512
<i>Why are we still
talking about mutants?</i>

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.059
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.555
Yeah, it was a good trip.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.229
Killed it up and down the fence.

00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:13.896
USA! USA! USA!

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:20.655
USA! USA! USA! USA!

00:05:47.932 --> 00:05:49.272
Wolverine.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:52.227
I knew it was you.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.729
Oh, fuck.
Please!

00:05:55.023 --> 00:05:56.573
I'm in trouble!

00:05:56.816 --> 00:05:58.936
You're the only one
that could help!

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:02.702
Get the fuck away from me!

00:06:07.785 --> 00:06:08.945
Please!

00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:11.211
Logan!

00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.461
Who was that?

00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:19.463
I don't know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry.

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:25.571
As I live and breathe,
the Wolverine.

00:07:26.197 --> 00:07:27.867
And he's a junkie now.

00:07:28.032 --> 00:07:29.492
Who the fuck are you?

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:33.155
You know, you got some
buckshot in your door.

00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:35.038
I heard you was in Phoenix.

00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:38.042
But then, last night,
some friends of mine

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:39.286
in Texas HP called...

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.710
and told me they found

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.005
three dead cholos
in a pullout on 54.

00:07:44.048 --> 00:07:46.298
Not unusual, I know.

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.967
Except one was missing a hand,
another one a leg.

00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:51.564
So they was thinking...

00:07:51.722 --> 00:07:54.732
it was either an escaped
tiger or Freddy Krueger.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:57.308
But neither one of them
can drive...

00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:00.478
one being fictional,
the other one extinct.

00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:02.818
And since the wheel lugs
they found

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.820
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.990
and, well...

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.568
this is a '24 Chrysler.

00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:13.494
She found you yet?

00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.831
Gabriela?

00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:18.084
See...

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:20.749
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:23.338
Well, not really.
I'm looking for someone

00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:24.761
who's looking for you.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.760
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:31.756
Something for which
I am responsible.

00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:34.524
Mexican lady.

00:08:35.516 --> 00:08:37.386
Has her sights on you now.

00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:41.231
Doesn't ring any bells?

00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:42.477
I don't know any Gabriela,

00:08:42.565 --> 00:08:43.935
so get the fuck out of my car.

00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:45.744
Oh.

00:08:46.777 --> 00:08:47.817
You know...

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.779
I know
what you're hiding, <i>amigo.</i>

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:54.035
The old cue ball
south of the border.

00:08:54.785 --> 00:08:55.945
What do you want?

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.710
A little co-operation.

00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:08.634
I'm a fan, by the way.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.350
Fuck, fuck!

00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:21.814
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:24.983
I know I said June,
but I need the boat now.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:26.649
Why would that mean
the price go up?

00:09:26.817 --> 00:09:28.897
Listen to me.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.910
I know you wanted 70...

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:32.382
Okay, what if I could
put together

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.406
$45,000 cash right now?

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.155
Hello? Hello?

00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:37.447
Shit.

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:41.915
Hey, Sam.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:43.083
Morning.

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:35.393
"I know that virtue
to be in you, Brutus.

00:10:35.553 --> 00:10:38.063
"As well as I do know
your outward favor.

00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.522
"Well, honor is the subject
of my story."

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:42.143
He's having a bad day.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.690
They're all bad days.

00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:46.689
He needed these six hours ago.

00:10:50.192 --> 00:10:51.742
This is not enough, you know.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.200
Won't see us through the week.

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:55.533
I'm working on it.

00:10:57.867 --> 00:10:58.867
Your turn.

00:10:59.577 --> 00:11:01.157
I've had a rough night.

00:11:02.747 --> 00:11:03.867
Poor you.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:10.339
In other news,
he told me last night

00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:11.701
he's communicating with someone.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:13.759
He's not talking to anybody.

00:11:13.924 --> 00:11:15.224
Don't be so sure.

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:17.394
He's got all these details.

00:11:17.553 --> 00:11:20.103
I thought that tank was
supposed to act as a barrier.

00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:21.434
It's got them cracks in it.

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:22.769
Just please stop.

00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:24.444
Bottom left.

00:11:31.108 --> 00:11:32.528
You're not listening.

00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:35.953
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

00:11:36.113 --> 00:11:37.783
I think he's trying to
read my mind.

00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:39.238
That's what these are for.

00:11:41.786 --> 00:11:43.446
<i>Eating his curds and whey</i>

00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:46.291
<i>Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her</i>

00:11:46.457 --> 00:11:47.617
<i>And frightened Miss Muffet...</i>

00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:03.268
Friends, I have
good news for you today!

00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:04.812
It's not about what you do.

00:12:04.975 --> 00:12:06.975
It's not about your deeds.

00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:08.561
You can't
live up to God's rules.

00:12:08.729 --> 00:12:12.729
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

00:12:14.902 --> 00:12:16.492
Make way, sir.

00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:18.823
I said make way!

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:22.119
The new Quesalupa
from Taco Bell!

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:24.624
Get it with chicken!
Get it with steak!

00:12:24.787 --> 00:12:26.827
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

00:12:26.997 --> 00:12:28.787
it's the next big thing!

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.958
Go now while supplies last.

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:33.841
Who are you?

00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:35.588
You know who I am.

00:12:35.756 --> 00:12:38.086
You're the man
who puts me to sleep.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:39.469
We both could use some sleep.

00:12:39.635 --> 00:12:41.005
No! No!

00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:47.643
What are you doing to me?

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:48.726
Charles.

00:12:50.187 --> 00:12:52.187
Come on, now.

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:36.358
How long have I been here?

00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.091
What are these?

00:13:58.255 --> 00:13:59.566
You remember what they are.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.510
The shots mellow the seizures.

00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.262
The pills
keep them from happening.

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.429
How about you blow on them
to make them safe?

00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:08.718
Fuck off, Logan.

00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:10.391
So you remember who I am now.

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.899
I always know who you are.

00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:15.562
It's just sometimes
I don't recognize you.

00:14:16.732 --> 00:14:17.902
Take the pills.

00:14:23.739 --> 00:14:26.449
You leave me alone
with that fucking albino.

00:14:26.617 --> 00:14:28.117
He doesn't listen to me.

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:31.409
I know a damn speciation
when I see one.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.580
A what?

00:14:32.748 --> 00:14:35.788
Speciation.
New mutant, a young one.

00:14:36.585 --> 00:14:37.771
There are forces
trying to kill them.

00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:39.625
Forces?
They want help.

00:14:40.047 --> 00:14:42.297
Forces, forces.

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:44.796
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:47.599
They don't want me,
they want you.

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:53.136
Oh, yes, that's how
fucking stupid they are.

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:57.151
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

00:14:57.314 --> 00:14:59.574
The Statue of Liberty
was a long time ago,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:00.990
Charles, a long time.

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:04.149
There are no new mutants.
Understand?

00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:07.491
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

00:15:07.658 --> 00:15:09.118
You always thought...

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:11.947
we were part of God's plan.

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:16.833
But maybe...

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:20.498
Maybe we were God's mistake.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:33.099
What a disappointment you are.

00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:37.146
When I found you...

00:15:37.313 --> 00:15:41.153
you were pursuing a career
as a cage fighter.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.525
A warm capper to a life
as an assassin.

00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.945
Hooked on barbiturates.

00:15:47.114 --> 00:15:49.374
You were an animal.

00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:52.039
But we took you in.

00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.833
I gave you a family.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.290
And they're gone now.

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:58.384
Logan.

00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:00.877
Logan...

00:16:03.047 --> 00:16:04.547
What did you do?

00:16:06.884 --> 00:16:08.224
What did you do?

00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:10.465
Answer me!
Why are we here?

00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:12.388
No one should live like this.

00:16:12.556 --> 00:16:13.966
Drugged in a fucking tank!

00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:15.231
It's for your own good.

00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:16.391
No, it's not!

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.070
You're waiting for me to die.

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.673
I don't wanna fight...

00:18:04.835 --> 00:18:07.495
but there's things
we need to discuss.

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:09.919
What things?

00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:13.967
Well, would it be
considered nagging...

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.758
if I was to repeat
my previous observation...

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.520
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

00:18:21.518 --> 00:18:23.268
It's what the guy gave me.

00:18:23.437 --> 00:18:25.687
Wasn't in a position
to make demands.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.266
I almost died this morning.

00:18:27.441 --> 00:18:29.002
That seizure was...
It was barely a minute.

00:18:29.026 --> 00:18:31.171
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

00:18:31.195 --> 00:18:32.525
You're less affected.

00:18:32.696 --> 00:18:34.526
You know he needs a higher dose.

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:37.488
And I know you got more
money squirreled away.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:38.928
That money's
to get us out of here.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.702
No, not us.
You and him.

00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:42.501
You're saving
to buy a Sunseeker.

00:18:42.664 --> 00:18:44.004
"Sun" is the keyword.

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:47.376
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:48.554
Do you?

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:52.472
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:57.844
Found this in your pocket.

00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:00.888
Adamantium.

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.329
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

00:19:04.353 --> 00:19:06.164
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

00:19:06.188 --> 00:19:07.438
I just mopped these floors.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:08.904
I don't need this shit.

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.996
A year ago, you asked
me to help you.

00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.915
And God knows I've tried.

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:28.713
But I can't help you,
Logan, not really...

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.380
if you're not
going to talk to me.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:35.051
I hear you at night.
You're not sleeping.

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:36.887
You don't wanna talk about that.

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:40.757
Or the booze you're drinking.

00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:43.851
Or the pus you're wiping
away from your knuckles.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.940
Or the blood
I wash from your clothes.

00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:49.441
Or the fresh wounds
in your chest.

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.938
The ones that aren't healing.

00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:53.532
And I'm pretty sure...

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.712
you don't wanna talk
about the fact

00:19:54.736 --> 00:19:56.606
that you can't read
the label on that bottle.

00:19:58.282 --> 00:19:59.532
It says, "Ibuprofen."

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:02.788
That was my favorite mug.

00:20:03.287 --> 00:20:05.117
Stay out of my shit.

00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.751
Something's happening
to you, Logan.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:11.497
On the inside you're sick.
I can smell it.

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.545
<i>Best night ever!</i>

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:22.973
Hey, driver.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.580
I love you.
I love you.

00:20:43.744 --> 00:20:45.414
You're such a doll.

00:21:42.511 --> 00:21:43.721
Mr. Logan.

00:21:43.887 --> 00:21:44.927
Oh, Jesus.

00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:46.683
Please. We need a ride.

00:21:46.848 --> 00:21:48.728
Not available.
Call a cab.

00:21:48.892 --> 00:21:49.932
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.162
I don't wanna
know your name, lady.

00:21:51.186 --> 00:21:52.646
There are men after us.

00:21:52.813 --> 00:21:54.290
We need to get out of here.

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:56.024
Go north, cross to Canada.

00:21:56.191 --> 00:21:57.731
Anyone can do that job.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:58.901
I'll give you $50,000.

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.153
How did you find me, huh?

00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:02.858
'Cause you are fucking up
my life, lady!

00:22:03.031 --> 00:22:05.241
The people after you,
they're on my ass now!

00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:07.539
Sightings were posted.

00:22:07.703 --> 00:22:08.753
Laura, go inside.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.080
What sightings?

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:11.975
People said someone who
looked like the Wolverine

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:13.999
was in El Paso, driving.

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:15.747
Said he looked old.

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:19.972
Hey!

00:22:20.173 --> 00:22:22.093
I told you
to stop it with that ball!

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:23.389
Bad girl!
No, please.

00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:25.102
I told you, bad girl!
No, please.

00:22:25.262 --> 00:22:26.364
<i>Mamacita's</i> gonna
have to pay for that.

00:22:26.388 --> 00:22:27.388
Stop, please. No.

00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:30.771
Shit!

00:22:33.103 --> 00:22:34.583
They're gonna
have to pay for damages.

00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:37.399
And she has cash.

00:22:37.566 --> 00:22:38.566
I've seen it.

00:22:38.734 --> 00:22:40.420
You should get your fat ass
back in your office.

00:22:40.444 --> 00:22:41.454
You'll get your money.

00:22:44.364 --> 00:22:46.374
Don't let her call anyone,
please.

00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:48.583
They will find us.
They will kill us.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.130
I am a nurse.

00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:01.801
Was. In Mexico City.

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.430
When did that happen?

00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:07.974
This morning.
Near the border.

00:23:11.641 --> 00:23:12.981
I got away from them, but...

00:23:15.312 --> 00:23:16.312
now they know my car.

00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:22.403
Look, I gotta go.

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:24.779
No, wait. Please. Here.

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.323
Please, wait! Look.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.240
Look. Here, take this.
It's $20,000.

00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.583
Here. Take us
to this address.

00:23:32.954 --> 00:23:35.174
You can have $30,000 more
when we get there.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.630
My friends there
will give it to you.

00:23:39.127 --> 00:23:40.587
They will be waiting.

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:43.011
They will give you anything.

00:23:44.132 --> 00:23:45.302
Where did you get this?

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:46.797
My boyfriend.

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:50.311
He wants to kill me
and take her.

00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:55.015
And that's your daughter?

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.020
Yes.

00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:04.151
I know you're still good inside.

00:24:04.319 --> 00:24:05.399
I know you want to help us.

00:24:05.445 --> 00:24:06.506
You don't know
anything about me.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:07.530
Please!

00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:10.874
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

00:24:11.034 --> 00:24:12.954
I can't just leave
to North Dakota!

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.620
We have to be there Friday.
Or what?

00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:17.368
Or we miss our chance to cross.

00:24:17.958 --> 00:24:18.998
Please.

00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:21.213
You have to. Please.

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:25.804
Please.

00:24:33.348 --> 00:24:35.058
I like those.
Huh?

00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:36.935
They make you look younger.

00:24:41.398 --> 00:24:42.728
Charles, listen.

00:24:43.608 --> 00:24:45.398
I gotta go away
for a few days, okay?

00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:48.408
I got a long ride
for some good money...

00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:50.452
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:52.534
We're gonna
drive down to Yelapa.

00:24:52.617 --> 00:24:53.897
We're gonna
get ourselves a boat.

00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:55.911
And we're gonna
go live on the ocean.

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:58.079
Will you be safe there?

00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:02.538
Yeah. We'll be safe.

00:25:02.711 --> 00:25:04.301
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

00:25:10.719 --> 00:25:11.929
Be back in a few days.

00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:56.258
Shit.

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:29.009
Logan.
Yeah?

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:30.342
What happened?

00:26:30.507 --> 00:26:31.877
Did something go wrong?

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.510
The job was wrong to begin with.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:55.030
Logan!

00:26:58.368 --> 00:26:59.488
Logan!

00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:00.701
What?

00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.871
Who does this belong to?

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.550
Who's that?

00:27:15.552 --> 00:27:18.052
Thought you were supposed to
see shit coming.

00:27:18.221 --> 00:27:19.391
I can track mutants.

00:27:19.556 --> 00:27:21.556
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

00:27:21.725 --> 00:27:23.385
Go inside
and keep Charles quiet.

00:27:23.518 --> 00:27:24.848
Go inside now!

00:27:34.112 --> 00:27:35.992
You need to turn around,
asshole.

00:27:36.072 --> 00:27:37.072
This is private property.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.450
Yes, it is.

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:40.909
In fact, I believe it belongs

00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:42.576
to a multinational
smelting company...

00:27:42.746 --> 00:27:44.116
based in Shanghai.

00:27:45.749 --> 00:27:47.959
Where are you keeping
the old man? Hmm?

00:27:48.126 --> 00:27:49.586
Is he over there?

00:27:52.255 --> 00:27:53.415
Or is he there?

00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:55.591
That'd be smart.

00:27:57.093 --> 00:27:59.393
I'd like to meet him.

00:27:59.554 --> 00:28:02.184
I'm told the HSA
classifies his brain

00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:04.305
as a weapon
of mass destruction now.

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:07.269
Damn shame,
what happened back east.

00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:09.769
He's been dead for a year.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.070
I need the girl.

00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:14.284
What girl?

00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:16.564
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

00:28:17.072 --> 00:28:18.622
There's no girl here.

00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:20.452
I know you went to the motel.

00:28:20.617 --> 00:28:21.827
Yeah, I was called there.

00:28:21.993 --> 00:28:23.913
There was no girl.
It was just the woman.

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.579
Just the woman.
Such as she was.

00:28:29.459 --> 00:28:30.919
So, you saw Gabriela.

00:28:32.253 --> 00:28:35.513
But you didn't call me.
That hurts.

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:38.733
You didn't shoot
the poor thing, did you?

00:28:38.802 --> 00:28:39.932
No, did you?

00:28:40.053 --> 00:28:41.143
I asked you first.

00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:42.394
I don't like guns.

00:28:42.514 --> 00:28:43.644
Of course.

00:28:44.432 --> 00:28:47.192
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

00:28:47.352 --> 00:28:48.522
Like I asked.

00:28:51.648 --> 00:28:52.818
See?

00:28:52.982 --> 00:28:55.032
You're not the only one
that's been enhanced.

00:29:03.284 --> 00:29:04.954
Logan. Logan!

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.120
This is Laura.

00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:08.831
Caliban, come!

00:29:09.332 --> 00:29:11.792
This is who
I've been telling you about.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.670
This is Laura.

00:29:14.462 --> 00:29:16.212
We've been waiting for you.

00:29:21.302 --> 00:29:22.302
Come, come here.

00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:24.853
It's okay.

00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:26.348
Come.

00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:29.061
Laura.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:33.690
It's okay. It's okay.

00:29:35.817 --> 00:29:36.817
Come.

00:29:37.068 --> 00:29:38.068
Come.

00:29:39.696 --> 00:29:43.316
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:44.825
It's safe.

00:29:45.326 --> 00:29:46.576
We can look after you here.

00:29:47.203 --> 00:29:48.203
Come on.

00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:52.248
Looks like ex-military.
Bounty hunter, maybe?

00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:53.417
Worse.

00:29:54.711 --> 00:29:55.881
Is he by himself?

00:29:56.045 --> 00:29:57.085
Yeah, not for long.

00:29:58.006 --> 00:29:59.336
You get him back in his ride,

00:29:59.424 --> 00:30:01.054
take him out to the wash
and dump him.

00:30:01.217 --> 00:30:02.887
What if he wakes up
before I get there?

00:30:08.057 --> 00:30:10.187
Text me where you are.
We'll pick you up.

00:30:23.907 --> 00:30:24.907
Yes.

00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:30.078
Logan.

00:30:30.914 --> 00:30:32.424
Logan.
Hey. Hey!

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:35.036
You'll get it back
after I figure out

00:30:35.126 --> 00:30:36.766
what you and your mother
have got us into.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.130
No, Logan.
What?

00:30:38.296 --> 00:30:39.296
I think the...

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.350
Logan, the woman that you met,
that's not her mother.

00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:54.648
So she talks?
We're communicating.

00:30:54.812 --> 00:30:56.062
Communicating.

00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:58.899
Take these now.

00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:02.488
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

00:31:02.654 --> 00:31:04.814
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:09.115
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

00:31:09.285 --> 00:31:11.035
She needs our help.
She's not a mutant.

00:31:11.204 --> 00:31:12.294
Yes, she is!

00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:13.535
What's her gift, Charles?

00:31:13.706 --> 00:31:15.166
Eating? Pipe throwing?

00:31:18.211 --> 00:31:19.301
It's okay.

00:31:39.732 --> 00:31:40.822
Oh, yeah.

00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:42.904
Take the gun.
Dump the body.

00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:45.149
Text me when you're
on the way back.

00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:46.601
You have anything else you need?

00:31:46.656 --> 00:31:48.316
Food for the kid?

00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:56.211
You're fucked now, mutie.

00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:07.719
It's okay.

00:32:09.512 --> 00:32:11.682
- Choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.

00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:17.345
It's okay. Sit down.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.860
We gotta go.
What?

00:32:19.022 --> 00:32:20.572
What's going on? Where?
Stay here.

00:32:20.732 --> 00:32:22.192
Don't move.
Where are we going?

00:32:23.109 --> 00:32:25.739
Hey, don't worry.
He will be back for you.

00:32:29.866 --> 00:32:32.616
Logan, the girl. You've got
to go back for the girl.

00:32:37.707 --> 00:32:40.037
Logan, what about the girl?

00:32:41.711 --> 00:32:42.881
Logan.

00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:51.602
Logan, we mustn't forget
about Laura.

00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:53.103
She's not our problem.

00:33:01.564 --> 00:33:02.694
Shit!

00:33:11.157 --> 00:33:12.157
Ah, shit!

00:33:40.895 --> 00:33:41.975
Logan.

00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:43.266
Yeah, I'm thinking.

00:33:43.439 --> 00:33:44.479
The child.

00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:46.944
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.280
Please be quiet.
Logan.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.530
Huh.

00:33:53.616 --> 00:33:55.446
Charles Xavier.
Where's Caliban?

00:33:55.993 --> 00:33:57.953
America's most wanted
octogenarian.

00:33:58.121 --> 00:33:59.621
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

00:34:05.628 --> 00:34:06.628
Ah.

00:34:08.548 --> 00:34:09.548
Where's Caliban?

00:34:11.509 --> 00:34:13.195
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.139
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:16.814
I told you, she's not here.

00:34:16.973 --> 00:34:19.233
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

00:34:20.476 --> 00:34:21.662
Well, I left him
in the same ditch

00:34:21.686 --> 00:34:22.806
he was gonna leave me in.

00:34:39.203 --> 00:34:40.373
Jesus, Wolverine,

00:34:40.496 --> 00:34:42.496
seeing you like this
just breaks my damn heart.

00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:44.625
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

00:34:52.717 --> 00:34:53.837
Go get her.

00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:08.078
Laura.

00:36:12.463 --> 00:36:13.973
That a girl!

00:36:15.424 --> 00:36:16.434
Hey, baby.

00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:27.018
Laura...

00:36:29.981 --> 00:36:31.021
Laura!

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.190
Honey, you wanna stay
where you are.

00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:36.279
You wanna see
your friends, right?

00:36:37.822 --> 00:36:39.162
Command, stop.

00:36:40.032 --> 00:36:41.662
You said alive or dead.

00:36:42.952 --> 00:36:43.952
Laura!

00:36:45.621 --> 00:36:46.621
Laura.

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:49.379
Laura.

00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:51.292
No. No.

00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:54.552
Move! Go!

00:37:00.303 --> 00:37:01.503
Move! Go!

00:37:05.683 --> 00:37:07.483
Stop shooting!

00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:10.733
She heals! Move! Go!

00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:13.861
Holy shit!

00:37:58.402 --> 00:37:59.532
Gotcha!

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.250
Ah!

00:38:10.873 --> 00:38:11.963
Come on, hold her down.

00:39:04.093 --> 00:39:06.643
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

00:39:07.096 --> 00:39:08.136
Hold on!

00:39:11.267 --> 00:39:12.517
Very much like you.

00:39:34.623 --> 00:39:35.833
Laura, are you all right?

00:39:47.553 --> 00:39:48.643
Ahh!

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:55.810
Move!

00:40:04.737 --> 00:40:05.737
Hold on!

00:40:11.577 --> 00:40:13.367
Fuck! Come on!

00:40:14.997 --> 00:40:15.997
Come on!

00:40:23.047 --> 00:40:24.167
Shit.

00:41:16.642 --> 00:41:18.482
Fall in! Let's go!

00:41:25.317 --> 00:41:26.607
Oh, watch out!

00:41:26.944 --> 00:41:27.954
Ah!

00:42:10.696 --> 00:42:11.776
Sit back.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:22.540
Bring me the tracker.

00:42:30.007 --> 00:42:31.047
You.

00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:34.295
Who the hell are you?

00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:38.641
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

00:42:39.808 --> 00:42:41.478
You know who she is, Logan.

00:42:42.311 --> 00:42:43.351
No, I don't.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.730
Does she remind you of anybody?

00:43:17.346 --> 00:43:19.556
I read about you
when I was a kid.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.100
I believe you're thinking
of someone else.

00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:24.185
Hmm.

00:43:31.443 --> 00:43:35.703
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

00:43:36.198 --> 00:43:38.908
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:41.118
What changed?

00:43:42.454 --> 00:43:43.544
You got religion?

00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:49.253
I'm gonna need you to do

00:43:49.378 --> 00:43:51.088
one more thing
for the good guys...

00:43:52.923 --> 00:43:56.393
and track one more
special mute for me.

00:44:00.556 --> 00:44:01.766
I'm not helping you.

00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:03.933
Of course, you'd say that.

00:44:04.601 --> 00:44:07.481
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:12.396
Beware of the light.

00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:16.199
Caliban, I bet that's what
your mama told you

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.910
every day when you was a kid.

00:44:24.163 --> 00:44:25.463
Beware of the light.

00:44:31.337 --> 00:44:34.087
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

00:44:34.173 --> 00:44:35.763
The girl is not worth it,
trust me.

00:44:36.008 --> 00:44:38.258
She's not a natural fuck-up
like you.

00:44:38.427 --> 00:44:41.097
She's a business mistake,
a R&D gone bad.

00:44:41.263 --> 00:44:42.433
There's liability.

00:44:42.765 --> 00:44:44.215
They can't have things
with patents

00:44:44.308 --> 00:44:46.098
running around,
hurting people, can they?

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:49.019
We need to get her off the board

00:44:49.104 --> 00:44:50.774
before she hurts anybody else.

00:44:50.939 --> 00:44:53.529
Someone you care about, maybe.

00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:02.446
So, get to sniffin'.

00:45:06.955 --> 00:45:08.955
<i>My name is Gabriela Lopez.</i>

00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:10.631
<i>I am a nurse.</i>

00:45:10.793 --> 00:45:12.423
<i>And for 10 years, I worked for</i>

00:45:12.503 --> 00:45:14.963
<i>Transigen Research
in Mexico City.</i>

00:45:16.173 --> 00:45:18.843
<i>Transigen is owned
by an American company.</i>

00:45:22.221 --> 00:45:24.681
<i>What I am about to show you
is illegal...</i>

00:45:25.015 --> 00:45:27.305
<i>in the U.S. and Canada.</i>

00:45:34.817 --> 00:45:37.067
<i>They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.</i>

00:45:37.528 --> 00:45:39.238
<i>But, of course, that was a lie.</i>

00:45:39.405 --> 00:45:42.655
<i>These children
were born in Transigen.</i>

00:45:43.826 --> 00:45:45.196
<i>They were born here...</i>

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:47.749
<i>and have never left.</i>

00:45:47.913 --> 00:45:50.503
<i>They have never seen
the sun or the ocean...</i>

00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:52.843
<i>rain or snow...</i>

00:45:54.169 --> 00:45:55.879
<i>or any of God's creatures.</i>

00:45:56.839 --> 00:45:58.719
<i>They have no
birth certificates...</i>

00:45:59.216 --> 00:46:00.676
<i>no names...</i>

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.180
<i>besides the ones
we have given them.</i>

00:46:06.223 --> 00:46:10.193
<i>They were raised in the
bellies of Mexican girls.</i>

00:46:10.352 --> 00:46:12.232
<i>Girls no one can find anymore.</i>

00:46:12.938 --> 00:46:16.188
<i>Their fathers are</i>
semillas geneticas...

00:46:16.358 --> 00:46:17.858
<i>special seeds in bottles.</i>

00:46:32.374 --> 00:46:33.924
<i>- Birthday? No birth.
- Maria.</i>

00:46:34.877 --> 00:46:36.627
<i>We do not dress them up
for Halloween.</i>

00:46:37.379 --> 00:46:39.919
<i>We do not call them "baby"
or kiss boo-boos.</i>

00:46:40.757 --> 00:46:41.901
<i>Don't think of them as children.</i>

00:46:41.925 --> 00:46:43.005
<i>Think of them as things...</i>

00:46:43.093 --> 00:46:44.603
<i>with patents and copyrights.</i>

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.720
<i>Comprende?</i>

00:46:45.804 --> 00:46:46.814
<i>Si, senor.</i>

00:46:47.556 --> 00:46:49.176
<i>They thought we were too poor</i>

00:46:49.266 --> 00:46:50.476
<i>and stupid to understand.</i>

00:46:51.143 --> 00:46:53.063
<i>We're poor, yes...</i>

00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:54.268
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

00:46:54.396 --> 00:46:55.556
<i>Use your powers.</i>

00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:04.161
<i>This is business.</i>

00:47:04.323 --> 00:47:06.783
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

00:47:07.409 --> 00:47:08.409
<i>Killers.</i>

00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:16.463
<i>These are babies of</i> mutantes...

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:25.259
North Dakota.

00:47:25.427 --> 00:47:26.427
Mmm.

00:47:26.803 --> 00:47:28.763
You took that woman's money.

00:47:28.931 --> 00:47:31.311
You said you would take
the child there.

00:47:36.772 --> 00:47:38.232
What is she?

00:47:39.608 --> 00:47:41.278
She's your daughter, Logan.

00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:45.155
Alkali has your genetic code.

00:47:45.322 --> 00:47:46.492
Not just mine.

00:47:46.615 --> 00:47:47.615
Logan...

00:47:47.658 --> 00:47:48.760
I don't want to talk about it.

00:47:48.784 --> 00:47:49.969
I don't wanna hear
about it anymore.

00:47:49.993 --> 00:47:51.413
Logan...
Just stop.

00:47:51.954 --> 00:47:53.254
I have to pee.

00:48:06.468 --> 00:48:07.468
Last ride.

00:48:11.932 --> 00:48:13.022
You're welcome.

00:48:19.606 --> 00:48:20.886
Stop it.
For God's sake,

00:48:20.941 --> 00:48:22.281
I can do this myself!

00:48:22.442 --> 00:48:23.586
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:24.740
Just get on with it.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.360
Not with you standing there.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.120
Trust me, I'm not lookin'.

00:49:02.065 --> 00:49:03.065
Hello.

00:49:03.692 --> 00:49:04.822
Hi, there!

00:49:05.319 --> 00:49:06.839
You know you gotta pay
for that, right?

00:49:08.864 --> 00:49:11.414
Hey! Where's your
mommy and daddy, huh?

00:49:14.828 --> 00:49:15.828
Come on.

00:49:15.996 --> 00:49:17.076
That's enough. These, too.

00:49:19.374 --> 00:49:20.424
Shit!

00:49:20.626 --> 00:49:21.706
Not okay!

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.050
Sorry.

00:49:27.132 --> 00:49:28.802
Um, do you sell phone chargers?

00:49:29.384 --> 00:49:30.514
Uh...

00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:37.226
Come on. Get in the car.

00:50:03.794 --> 00:50:05.714
<i>As the children became older...</i>

00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.919
<i>Laura. Laura.</i>

00:50:08.423 --> 00:50:10.263
<i>They became more difficult.</i>

00:50:12.594 --> 00:50:14.394
<i>They could not be controlled.</i>

00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:20.097
<i>The company made their bodies
into weapons.</i>

00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:22.936
<i>Tried to teach them to kill.</i>

00:50:23.105 --> 00:50:25.315
<i>But they did not want to fight.</i>

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.900
<i>A soldier who will not fight
is useless.</i>

00:50:32.989 --> 00:50:34.949
<i>Inside this building...</i>

00:50:35.117 --> 00:50:36.437
<i>they are working on
something new.</i>

00:50:37.119 --> 00:50:40.119
<i>Something they think
is better than the children.</i>

00:50:40.706 --> 00:50:43.126
<i>Something they say
is without a soul.</i>

00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:44.811
<i>Would you like to hear
my full lab report, Dr. Rice?</i>

00:50:44.835 --> 00:50:46.495
<i>You can't get good sushi here.</i>

00:50:46.753 --> 00:50:48.803
<i>It's the Mexican equivalent
of Denver, Colorado.</i>

00:50:51.133 --> 00:50:52.733
<i>They must have been successful.</i>

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:55.970
<i>About a week ago, they told
us to shut our program down.</i>

00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:01.309
<i>They started putting
the children to sleep.</i>

00:51:04.688 --> 00:51:07.648
<i>We are going to save
as many children as we can.</i>

00:51:07.983 --> 00:51:10.073
<i>I read about a place, up north.</i>

00:51:10.485 --> 00:51:12.275
<i>A place for mutants.</i>

00:51:12.446 --> 00:51:13.656
<i>They call it Eden.</i>

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.300
<i>If you are watching this...</i>

00:51:30.464 --> 00:51:32.304
<i>it means that I am dead.</i>

00:51:33.383 --> 00:51:36.643
<i>I am not sure if
any other children survived.</i>

00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:39.143
<i>We were separated.</i>

00:51:39.306 --> 00:51:41.346
<i>There is no more money.</i>

00:51:41.516 --> 00:51:43.186
<i>That was a lie.</i>

00:51:44.644 --> 00:51:46.234
<i>She's not my child.</i>

00:51:47.731 --> 00:51:49.151
<i>But I love her.</i>

00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:52.688
<i>You may not love her.</i>

00:51:54.321 --> 00:51:56.701
<i>But she is your child.</i>

00:51:57.866 --> 00:52:00.406
<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.870
<i>take her to safety.</i>

00:52:49.918 --> 00:52:52.128
Is this where we're hiding out?

00:52:52.796 --> 00:52:53.916
We're not hiding out.

00:52:54.047 --> 00:52:56.087
We're gonna get
a couple of hours' sleep...

00:52:56.258 --> 00:52:57.838
clean up, get some new clothes,

00:52:57.926 --> 00:53:00.096
get a new ride
and get outta here.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.119
<i>Harrah's Hotel and Casino</i>

00:53:07.143 --> 00:53:08.443
<i>welcomes you to Oklahoma City.</i>

00:53:09.145 --> 00:53:12.015
<i>Please keep right
for valet parking.</i>

00:53:12.107 --> 00:53:13.147
Hey.

00:53:13.275 --> 00:53:14.919
<i>The fun never stops at
Harrah's Hotel and Casino.</i>

00:53:14.943 --> 00:53:17.453
Hey, keep it out front,
all right?

00:53:23.785 --> 00:53:25.245
Come on, let's go.

00:53:52.188 --> 00:53:53.358
Hey, Laura.

00:53:53.523 --> 00:53:54.573
Let's go.

00:53:54.649 --> 00:53:55.779
We need clothes.

00:54:08.496 --> 00:54:09.706
<i>Going up.</i>

00:54:11.833 --> 00:54:13.843
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

00:54:14.836 --> 00:54:16.126
Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.

00:54:16.254 --> 00:54:17.514
What? Okay.

00:54:18.006 --> 00:54:19.166
Push up again.
Thank you.

00:54:19.341 --> 00:54:20.381
<i>Going up.</i>

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.680
Come here. Stand there.
Just stand there.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.760
Logan, it's yours.

00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:26.887
What?

00:54:27.015 --> 00:54:28.055
I'm not gonna wear it now.

00:54:28.141 --> 00:54:29.821
In the room. We'll get
changed in the room.

00:54:31.561 --> 00:54:32.981
<i>You're a low-down, lying Yankee.</i>

00:54:34.189 --> 00:54:35.229
<i>Prove it.</i>

00:54:43.907 --> 00:54:46.657
This is a very
famous picture, Laura.

00:54:46.826 --> 00:54:48.536
It's almost 100 years old.

00:55:08.556 --> 00:55:13.396
<i>In life, in death, oh, Lord</i>

00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:18.271
<i>Abide with me</i>

00:55:22.112 --> 00:55:24.322
I first saw this picture

00:55:24.406 --> 00:55:26.906
at the Essoldo Cinema
in my hometown...

00:55:27.075 --> 00:55:29.235
when I was your age.

00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:32.751
<i>Who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name</i>

00:55:32.914 --> 00:55:36.294
<i>Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done</i>

00:55:47.262 --> 00:55:48.262
Shit.

00:56:29.304 --> 00:56:31.224
<i>I've heard
that you're a low-down,</i>

00:56:31.306 --> 00:56:32.966
<i>Yankee liar.</i>

00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:34.431
<i>Prove it.</i>

00:56:43.443 --> 00:56:45.153
You read these
in your spare time?

00:56:46.821 --> 00:56:48.871
Oh, yeah, Charles,
we got ourselves an <i>X-Men</i> fan.

00:56:49.824 --> 00:56:51.534
You do know
they're all bullshit, right?

00:56:51.618 --> 00:56:54.578
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:56.830
In the real world, people die.

00:56:56.998 --> 00:56:58.828
And no self-promoting asshole

00:56:58.917 --> 00:57:00.417
in a fucking leotard
can stop it.

00:57:00.585 --> 00:57:02.545
This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
Logan...

00:57:02.712 --> 00:57:04.148
Her nurse has been feeding
her some grade-A bullshit.

00:57:04.172 --> 00:57:05.552
I don't think
Laura needs reminding

00:57:05.632 --> 00:57:07.052
of life's impermanence.

00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:10.891
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

00:57:12.222 --> 00:57:14.022
Two more pills in one hour.

00:57:14.933 --> 00:57:16.063
Give 'em to him.

00:57:16.684 --> 00:57:17.944
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

00:57:19.229 --> 00:57:21.269
<i>A man has to be
what he is, Joey.</i>

00:57:22.524 --> 00:57:24.324
<i>Can't break the mold.</i>

00:57:24.484 --> 00:57:26.824
<i>I tried it
and it didn't work for me.</i>

00:57:26.986 --> 00:57:29.316
<i>Joey, there's no living
with a killing.</i>

00:57:29.489 --> 00:57:31.409
<i>There's no going back from one.</i>

00:57:31.574 --> 00:57:33.834
<i>Right or wrong, it's a brand.</i>

00:57:34.035 --> 00:57:35.495
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

00:57:36.579 --> 00:57:37.999
<i>Now you run on home
to your mother,</i>

00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:39.791
<i>and tell her
everything's all right.</i>

00:57:40.959 --> 00:57:44.049
<i>And there aren't any more
guns in the valley.</i>

00:58:04.732 --> 00:58:05.942
Who are you guys?

00:58:06.484 --> 00:58:07.744
More cops? 'Cause I told

00:58:07.819 --> 00:58:09.319
the other guys
everything that I...

00:58:19.247 --> 00:58:21.577
Get up!
In your cage, tracker.

00:58:21.749 --> 00:58:23.419
You did your job.

00:58:45.106 --> 00:58:46.476
Fellas.

00:58:59.746 --> 00:59:01.286
Shit.

00:59:02.832 --> 00:59:04.172
Knock yourselves out.

00:59:06.211 --> 00:59:07.646
I'll tell you what.
Eight grand...

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.920
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

00:59:10.089 --> 00:59:11.729
mounted, balanced,
and complete paperwork.

00:59:11.841 --> 00:59:13.051
I'll give you 10 as-is,

00:59:13.134 --> 00:59:14.594
if you can forget the paperwork.

00:59:16.429 --> 00:59:18.639
Well, you still need new
tires, man, they're bald.

00:59:18.806 --> 00:59:19.926
How long will that take?

00:59:20.099 --> 00:59:21.099
An hour.

00:59:53.716 --> 00:59:54.716
Jesus.

01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:10.227
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:22.575
Sir, are the keys in...
Sir!

01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:24.745
You have
the keys in it? Sir!

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.840
Shit!

01:00:54.402 --> 01:00:56.032
Charles. Charles!

01:00:57.155 --> 01:00:58.485
Argh!

01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:30.018
<i>Going up.</i>

01:03:47.909 --> 01:03:49.079
Oh, shit!

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.453
You all right?

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:53.658
We gotta get outta here.

01:03:57.084 --> 01:03:58.594
I'm so sorry.

01:04:00.254 --> 01:04:01.634
I'm so sorry.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:29.009
<i>Emergency
personnel are still on scene</i>

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.663
<i>at Harrah's Casino Hotel
in Oklahoma City...</i>

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:33.747
<i>where at least 400 guests
were stricken</i>

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.669
<i>with temporary paralysis
yesterday.</i>

01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:37.628
<i>Many are noting a similarity</i>

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.508
<i>to the Westchester incident
over a year ago...</i>

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.245
<i>that left over 600 injured...</i>

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.689
<i>and took the lives
of seven mutants,</i>

01:04:42.713 --> 01:04:44.173
<i>including several of the X-Men.</i>

01:04:44.924 --> 01:04:46.054
Knock it off.

01:04:48.928 --> 01:04:50.428
I said, knock it off!

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:52.176
She's a child, Logan.

01:04:54.684 --> 01:04:56.194
And, point of fact,
she's your...

01:04:56.352 --> 01:04:58.152
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

01:05:00.273 --> 01:05:01.375
Tell me, how long has it been?

01:05:01.399 --> 01:05:02.729
I don't know!

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:04.741
Two days.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:06.452
You saw what happened yesterday.

01:05:06.529 --> 01:05:07.631
If that shit
had gone on any longer,

01:05:07.655 --> 01:05:08.735
everyone in that casino...

01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:11.083
I did what I had to do
to save Laura.

01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:12.542
You didn't do anything.

01:05:12.702 --> 01:05:15.122
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

01:05:15.788 --> 01:05:19.168
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:21.130
rambling on like a lunatic.

01:05:21.294 --> 01:05:22.804
So much easier for you.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.052
Easier? Jesus!

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:26.423
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.051
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:31.718
blaming someone else
for your boring shit.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.647
I know, Pop, I'm such
a giant disappointment.

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:37.729
You honestly derive
no sense of purpose...

01:05:37.893 --> 01:05:38.943
from what we're doing?

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:40.653
Okay, what are we doing?
Hmm?

01:05:41.397 --> 01:05:44.937
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:46.149
Yeah, I see that.

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:48.529
And where we're taking her,
there are others.

01:05:48.696 --> 01:05:50.486
Does that mean nothing to you?

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.486
Yeah, means nothing to me.

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:54.237
Especially since
Nurse Gabriela...

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:56.830
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

01:05:56.996 --> 01:05:58.656
What are you talking about?

01:05:58.831 --> 01:05:59.951
Give those to him, will you?

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.226
Take out two pills
and give them to him.

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.750
Logan! Logan!
Give 'em to him.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.090
Now!

01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.048
I wanna see it.

01:06:33.866 --> 01:06:36.036
Dr. Rice.
It's under control...

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:05.647
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

01:07:05.898 --> 01:07:07.108
Language, Logan.

01:07:07.274 --> 01:07:09.404
And you're screaming
at a machine.

01:07:09.568 --> 01:07:11.318
Oh, what? She can gut a man
with her feet,

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:12.923
she can't hear
a few naughty words, huh?

01:07:12.947 --> 01:07:15.527
She can learn to be better.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.160
You mean, better than me?

01:07:17.326 --> 01:07:19.036
Actually, yes.

01:07:20.788 --> 01:07:22.958
And, by the way,
Laura's foot claws...

01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:25.714
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:27.086
Is that a fact?

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:29.173
In a pride of lions,
the female...

01:07:29.338 --> 01:07:31.798
is both hunter and caregiver.

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:33.046
Good to know.

01:07:33.426 --> 01:07:35.926
She uses her front claws
for hunting...

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.425
and the back claws defensively.

01:07:37.513 --> 01:07:38.513
Oh, yeah?

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.217
Thus, ensuring their survival.

01:07:46.522 --> 01:07:47.652
Hey, hey!

01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:18.144
We should help them.

01:08:19.555 --> 01:08:21.845
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

01:08:22.016 --> 01:08:23.676
Someone has come along.

01:08:35.404 --> 01:08:37.744
<i>Alert. Alert.</i>

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:41.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:20.324 --> 01:09:22.374
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

01:09:23.744 --> 01:09:25.664
Ready? Go!

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.580
Ah. Good, got it.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.417
Come on, let's get home.
Laura!

01:09:33.504 --> 01:09:35.014
Thank you so much for your help.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:36.549
I'm Kathryn.
James.

01:09:36.715 --> 01:09:37.715
This is my son, Nate.

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.093
Hi.
Hey.

01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.680
That's your daughter?

01:09:40.845 --> 01:09:43.005
Yeah, that's Laura,
and that's my dad...

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:44.934
Chuck.

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:46.057
Come on, Laura, let's go.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.020
Well, can we show
our appreciation

01:09:48.102 --> 01:09:49.746
and treat the three of you
to a decent meal?

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:51.060
We don't live far from here.

01:09:51.230 --> 01:09:53.270
Uh, no, thanks.
That would be lovely!

01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.951
My name is Dr. Rice.

01:10:03.242 --> 01:10:04.952
But you can call me Zander
if you like.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.623
My colleague tells me

01:10:07.705 --> 01:10:10.075
you've been somewhat resistant.

01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:12.206
He believes you've been

01:10:12.293 --> 01:10:14.043
dispensing
delayed information...

01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:16.301
to allow your friends
to stay one step ahead.

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:20.944
I'm offering you the possibility

01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:22.258
of redemption, Caliban.

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:25.217
To protect the world,
and in the process,

01:10:25.306 --> 01:10:26.556
save your friends.

01:10:26.724 --> 01:10:29.984
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

01:10:30.144 --> 01:10:31.944
Unlike you, she's impure.

01:10:32.104 --> 01:10:33.814
She wasn't made by nature.

01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:35.151
She's a mistake of my own.

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:36.399
I did what I could

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:37.743
and they burned me and beat me.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:39.612
Your colleagues are savages.

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:41.494
I agree.

01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:43.485
The Reavers
were very ineffective.

01:10:43.657 --> 01:10:46.577
But I'm bringing
new tools to bear.

01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:47.754
But I still need someone

01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:48.972
to point us
in the right direction.

01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:50.246
No, I can't help you.

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.084
Breathe, breathe.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.249
Now, what does he have?
The old man.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.168
Alzheimer's? ALS?

01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:58.921
A degenerative brain disease

01:10:59.006 --> 01:11:01.426
in the world's most
dangerous brain?

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.339
What a combo.

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.310
<i>Be nice.
Now, you know we got company.</i>

01:11:08.474 --> 01:11:09.524
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:10.923
<i>Everybody, have a seat.</i>

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:12.308
<i>Nate, sit up.</i>

01:11:12.478 --> 01:11:14.164
<i>James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?</i>

01:11:14.188 --> 01:11:16.188
<i>You wanna say grace?
Say grace, baby.</i>

01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:19.777
Uh, thank you, God,
for this food...

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.994
and for our new friends,
the Howletts.

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.445
Mmm. They came
to our aid.

01:11:24.615 --> 01:11:25.985
Amen.
Amen.

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:27.677
Here we go.
Here you go, Charles.

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:29.541
Thank you, sir.

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:45.385
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.468
Oh, there's plenty more
if she wants.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.230
She's fine. Thank you.

01:11:51.392 --> 01:11:52.472
This is delicious.

01:11:52.559 --> 01:11:53.954
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

01:11:53.978 --> 01:11:55.348
Where are you all headed?

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:56.901
Uh... Oregon.
South Dakota.

01:11:58.732 --> 01:11:59.732
Um...

01:11:59.858 --> 01:12:02.238
Well, Oregon
and then South Dakota.

01:12:02.403 --> 01:12:03.743
Vacation?

01:12:03.904 --> 01:12:04.914
Uh... Yes.

01:12:05.322 --> 01:12:07.072
Uh, long overdue.

01:12:07.241 --> 01:12:08.491
We're city folk.

01:12:08.659 --> 01:12:12.079
Always wanted to take a road trip,
see the country.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:14.752
Um... And meet
the people in it.

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:16.165
That sounds lovely.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:17.453
Been trying to get Will here

01:12:17.543 --> 01:12:19.043
to take a vacation
for years now.

01:12:19.253 --> 01:12:20.855
Oh. If we go traipsing
all over the country,

01:12:20.879 --> 01:12:22.023
who's gonna take care
of this place?

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:23.917
Exactly.
I say, let it go.

01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:25.091
And live off what?

01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:27.009
The Lord will provide.

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:29.030
I'm still waiting for
the Lord to provide me

01:12:29.054 --> 01:12:30.264
with a new thresher.

01:12:30.431 --> 01:12:32.391
All the same,
I'd love to travel someday.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:34.769
And I bet you will.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:36.413
I could drop out of school.

01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:37.497
Okay, let's not go that far.

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:38.611
I mean, I'll do it.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:39.972
- No. No.
- Why not?

01:12:40.107 --> 01:12:41.437
You wanna travel,
I wanna travel.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:42.525
Son. Son.

01:12:42.943 --> 01:12:44.087
That sounds good to you, right?

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:45.401
This is the perfect plan.

01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:46.971
Why would you want
to do that, Nate?

01:12:47.698 --> 01:12:50.118
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

01:12:51.702 --> 01:12:53.122
for a lot of years.
Right, Charles?

01:12:53.746 --> 01:12:55.616
Yes, it was a...

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:59.418
It was a special needs
school. Um...

01:13:00.586 --> 01:13:02.126
Uh-huh.
That's a good description.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.300
He was there, too.

01:13:04.465 --> 01:13:05.465
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

01:13:05.591 --> 01:13:06.751
I got kicked out a few times.

01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:09.546
I wish I could say
you were a good pupil,

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:10.926
but the words would choke me.

01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:35.577
Ma'am, I can't thank you
enough for this.

01:13:35.662 --> 01:13:37.002
Uh, it was great.

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.964
But we have a long drive
ahead of us, so...

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:40.393
But you need to rest, don't you?

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.057
Yeah, we'll find
a motel somewhere.

01:13:42.086 --> 01:13:43.146
The nearest one
is two hours from here

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.290
and it's not even that nice.

01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.511
We have a perfectly fine
room upstairs

01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:47.776
for your father
and your daughter and

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.486
you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:50.779
Kathryn, it's very,
very nice of you,

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:52.013
but we really should go.

01:13:52.137 --> 01:13:54.307
We can leave
early in the morning.

01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:57.773
Break of dawn, as it were.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.439
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:03.606
Okay.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:04.690
Sit.

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:10.658
Um, sweetie,
you want some dessert?

01:14:10.823 --> 01:14:12.123
Two days on the road,

01:14:12.199 --> 01:14:14.119
only one meal,
and hardly any sleep.

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.334
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.325
Well, that's 101 reasons
to keep moving.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:20.497
I'm not a box
of avocados, Logan.

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:22.435
And then what?
We stay the night, then what?

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.959
Then we take her to
her friends in Eden.

01:14:28.215 --> 01:14:30.545
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

01:14:32.136 --> 01:14:33.466
Take the pills.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:38.891
Oh, shit!

01:14:40.561 --> 01:14:42.061
What's going on?
Nate!

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:44.229
Go fill up the tub
before we lose pressure.

01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:45.728
Honey, check the sink.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:47.319
They shut it off again.

01:14:47.985 --> 01:14:49.629
They are just not going to
let this thing go.

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:51.133
Well, you might as well
handle it now.

01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:53.133
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

01:14:53.157 --> 01:14:54.487
We got three houseguests

01:14:54.575 --> 01:14:55.615
and a sink full of dishes.

01:14:55.742 --> 01:14:57.372
All right, all right.

01:14:58.245 --> 01:14:59.655
The pump station
that supplies us

01:14:59.746 --> 01:15:00.986
is a mile and a half from here.

01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:02.876
Sometimes it gets itself
shut off.

01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:04.041
- By assholes.
- Hey!

01:15:04.209 --> 01:15:05.209
No.

01:15:05.586 --> 01:15:07.496
My son is happy to go with you.

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:09.421
No, no, no, that's fine.

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:11.430
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:13.342
I can go.
No, you got homework.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.010
All right, I'll go.

01:15:15.179 --> 01:15:16.889
Just, uh,
let me get my dad settled.

01:15:20.726 --> 01:15:21.726
All right.

01:15:23.395 --> 01:15:25.765
I'm just saying,
I don't care what the lawyer says.

01:15:28.108 --> 01:15:29.228
But it's dangerous.

01:15:29.902 --> 01:15:31.402
I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

01:15:45.459 --> 01:15:46.629
Want TV? There's TV here.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:47.793
I'm fine.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.050
Okay. Get some rest.

01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:51.129
You know, Logan...

01:15:51.715 --> 01:15:53.875
this is what life looks like.

01:15:54.301 --> 01:15:56.931
A home,
people who love each other.

01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:58.255
Safe place.

01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.970
You should
take a moment and feel it.

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.770
Yeah. It's great.

01:16:05.938 --> 01:16:07.478
Logan. Logan!

01:16:09.441 --> 01:16:11.571
You still have time.

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:18.242
Charles, the world is not
the same as it was.

01:16:20.661 --> 01:16:23.331
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

01:16:23.914 --> 01:16:26.584
And where we're going, Eden...

01:16:27.459 --> 01:16:28.839
it doesn't exist.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.923
Her nurse got it
from a comic book.

01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:36.179
You understand?
It's not real.

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.933
It is for Laura.

01:16:42.766 --> 01:16:45.186
It is for Laura.

01:16:48.146 --> 01:16:49.476
Get some rest.

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:54.945
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here,

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.198
except for us.

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:58.993
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

01:16:59.157 --> 01:17:00.777
then screwing with our water.

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:04.285
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

01:17:04.871 --> 01:17:07.541
So, out on the highway
today, those trucks...

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.210
Who knows. Maybe.

01:17:11.378 --> 01:17:13.378
Hey, look at 'em.

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:15.804
Look like dinosaurs
with their 20-ton bodies

01:17:15.882 --> 01:17:17.222
and tiny little brains...

01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:19.554
shucking their cloned-up
super corn.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.040
You know it tastes
like shit, too.

01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:22.388
Why do people eat it?

01:17:22.556 --> 01:17:24.886
They don't. They drink it.
Corn syrup.

01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.858
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:30.557
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

01:17:30.731 --> 01:17:33.571
Used to be a time when a bad
day was just a bad day.

01:17:33.734 --> 01:17:35.154
Mine still are.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:59.840
Those are for breakaway roping.

01:18:00.927 --> 01:18:02.677
Those are for barrel racing...

01:18:02.929 --> 01:18:04.929
and right here
is for pole bending.

01:18:05.098 --> 01:18:06.928
They're all second, third place.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.730
I'm not too good at it,
but my dad makes me.

01:18:19.446 --> 01:18:21.406
Do you want to listen?

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:32.788
Do you like it?

01:18:36.755 --> 01:18:39.085
Um, here, you can
take it for tonight...

01:18:39.257 --> 01:18:42.297
and I'll get it back
from you in the morning.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.228
Looks like we're gonna
be here a while.

01:19:30.684 --> 01:19:31.984
Should hold it.

01:19:32.144 --> 01:19:33.274
Yeah.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.110
Till next time.

01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:36.819
Thanks.

01:19:38.775 --> 01:19:41.105
Hey, so, uh,
how long has your girl

01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:42.824
been like that?
Huh?

01:19:43.196 --> 01:19:44.356
Mute.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:48.488
Uh, since the beginning.

01:19:49.035 --> 01:19:50.035
Mmm.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.710
Well, in a lot of ways,
I envy you.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:54.960
They get to be Nate's age,

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.041
with the nonsense that comes
out of their mouths...

01:19:57.961 --> 01:20:00.301
Makes you wonder the
whole point of it all.

01:20:02.674 --> 01:20:04.224
Shit.

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:09.388
Don't worry.

01:20:09.556 --> 01:20:11.016
We won't need it.

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:12.475
Stay here.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.190
Evening, Mr. Munson.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:22.815
What brings y'all this way?

01:20:23.904 --> 01:20:25.324
Why don't you ask your boys?

01:20:25.489 --> 01:20:26.659
Mr. Munson,

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.468
you understand you're
trespassing right now, right?

01:20:28.492 --> 01:20:30.052
I have an easement with
the previous owner

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:31.076
of your property.

01:20:31.161 --> 01:20:32.501
Huh. Bullshit.

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:34.662
"Previous" being
the operative word.

01:20:35.874 --> 01:20:37.084
Who's this?

01:20:38.418 --> 01:20:39.418
Just a guy telling you

01:20:39.544 --> 01:20:40.924
to get back in your nice truck.

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:43.757
Go play Okie dickhead
somewhere else.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.260
Hey, Carl...

01:20:50.013 --> 01:20:53.183
it looks like Mr. Munson
hired some muscle.

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:54.680
Looks that way.

01:20:54.851 --> 01:20:56.271
He's a friend of mine.

01:20:56.436 --> 01:20:58.096
A friend with a big mouth.

01:20:58.438 --> 01:20:59.688
I hear that a lot.

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:01.496
Then you probably
hear this, too.

01:21:04.069 --> 01:21:05.609
More than I'd like.

01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:06.949
Then you know the drill.

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:09.954
I'mma count to three...

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.516
and you're gonna
start walking away.

01:21:11.618 --> 01:21:12.678
I got rights to this water.

01:21:12.702 --> 01:21:13.872
One.
I have a lawyer now.

01:21:13.954 --> 01:21:14.964
Two.

01:21:16.623 --> 01:21:18.043
Three.
Ah. Ah.

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.541
You all right, boss?

01:21:22.295 --> 01:21:24.106
- You know the drill.
- Pick up my goddamn hat.

01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:25.130
Get the hell out of here.

01:21:25.298 --> 01:21:27.128
You okay, boss?
Fuck off.

01:21:27.217 --> 01:21:28.217
Go!

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:46.738
You've had training.

01:21:47.237 --> 01:21:48.277
Some.

01:22:08.008 --> 01:22:10.138
Hey, don't wake her yet.

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:12.930
Let her sleep another hour.

01:22:17.267 --> 01:22:19.017
You know, Logan...

01:22:20.687 --> 01:22:23.687
this was, without a doubt...

01:22:24.816 --> 01:22:29.816
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

01:22:37.829 --> 01:22:39.869
But I don't deserve it.

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:43.041
Do I?

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.803
I did something.

01:22:51.468 --> 01:22:53.888
Something unspeakable.

01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:03.399
I've remembered
what happened in Westchester.

01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:11.356
This is not the first time
I've hurt people.

01:23:13.365 --> 01:23:16.655
Until today, I didn't know.

01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:19.577
You wouldn't tell me.

01:23:21.748 --> 01:23:27.748
So we just kept on
running away from it.

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:35.885
I think I finally
understand you.

01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:40.555
Logan...

01:24:08.294 --> 01:24:09.634
He's fantastic.

01:24:09.796 --> 01:24:11.126
You said you only needed
the girl!

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:13.427
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

01:24:13.591 --> 01:24:14.801
Your friends had every chance.

01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:16.138
And so did you.

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:18.393
Nate?

01:24:22.142 --> 01:24:23.482
Put her down.

01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:32.993
Honey.

01:24:33.486 --> 01:24:35.106
Stay down there, Will!

01:24:37.449 --> 01:24:38.449
Stop!

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:40.857
Kathryn!

01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:42.638
Kathryn!

01:24:42.662 --> 01:24:44.002
Kathryn!

01:25:12.484 --> 01:25:13.534
Charles!

01:25:14.611 --> 01:25:15.781
Charles!

01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:30.125
Hold this.

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.463
It wasn't me.
It wasn't me.

01:25:35.048 --> 01:25:36.048
Here he comes.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.126
I could pick him up,

01:25:38.218 --> 01:25:39.218
meet him halfway.

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:40.845
No, no, no.
Let them come to us.

01:25:41.012 --> 01:25:43.142
We struggled with the X-23s.

01:25:43.306 --> 01:25:44.533
We assumed,
because they were children...

01:25:44.557 --> 01:25:45.993
we could raise them
without a conscience.

01:25:46.017 --> 01:25:47.887
But you can't nurture rage.

01:25:48.061 --> 01:25:49.231
You must simply design it...

01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:50.395
from scratch.

01:25:58.071 --> 01:26:00.411
Who the fuck is that?

01:26:05.328 --> 01:26:06.578
Will Munson!

01:26:09.749 --> 01:26:11.169
Just hold on, Charles.

01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:13.921
Munson,
God damn it, come out here!

01:26:18.258 --> 01:26:19.258
Munson!

01:26:21.010 --> 01:26:22.430
Come out here now!

01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:24.761
Come out here now, Munson.

01:26:24.931 --> 01:26:26.221
There's that asshole.

01:26:28.226 --> 01:26:29.556
Hello, asshole.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:32.607
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

01:26:32.939 --> 01:26:34.769
I don't know what
Munson's paying you...

01:26:35.358 --> 01:26:37.938
but Canewood can start
you out at five G.

01:26:38.069 --> 01:26:39.109
A week, that is.

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:43.374
You best stay
where you are, pal.

01:26:43.533 --> 01:26:45.293
I'm the law out here.

01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:47.869
No, no, no.

01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:50.247
What in high...

01:26:51.958 --> 01:26:53.878
What? Oh, shit!

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:55.043
Shoot him!

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.126
We need to intervene.

01:26:58.298 --> 01:27:00.548
Well, he only listens
to you, Doctor.

01:27:03.469 --> 01:27:04.599
24!

01:27:05.889 --> 01:27:06.889
Get back here!

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:09.144
Stop! Stop now!

01:27:09.309 --> 01:27:11.139
Hold this down,
right now, tight!

01:27:15.565 --> 01:27:17.315
Our boat.
What?

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.905
The Sunseeker.

01:27:34.584 --> 01:27:35.594
No.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:45.469
Come!

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:46.798
24!

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.100
Need some help out here!

01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:51.619
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

01:27:51.643 --> 01:27:53.163
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:54.991
Get your lily-faced
ass out here!

01:28:01.194 --> 01:28:02.364
Listen to me!

01:28:02.528 --> 01:28:04.088
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:28:04.197 --> 01:28:06.117
All right,
we gotta go around that truck

01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:07.489
and flank them farmers.

01:28:07.659 --> 01:28:08.949
Follow my lead.

01:28:09.035 --> 01:28:10.945
Bring extra ammo,
take these clips.

01:28:11.037 --> 01:28:12.077
Come!

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:13.540
Now!

01:28:14.374 --> 01:28:15.714
Pick her up.

01:28:26.552 --> 01:28:27.722
Beware the light.

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:52.330
What the hell are you?

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:20.558
Sit down.

01:31:39.871 --> 01:31:41.161
Hold still.

01:31:41.581 --> 01:31:42.921
Hold still.

01:32:04.937 --> 01:32:06.057
Get him on the truck.

01:32:06.105 --> 01:32:07.105
Yeah.

01:32:08.774 --> 01:32:10.034
Go.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.530
It's all right, it's all right.

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.620
It's all right.
You did fine, 24.

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:22.746
You're healing.
Just breathe.

01:32:24.123 --> 01:32:26.633
You're a newborn,
by any measure.

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:28.092
Just breathe.

01:32:28.419 --> 01:32:29.499
Your body has work to do.

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:32.260
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

01:32:32.423 --> 01:32:33.763
stromal cell proliferation.

01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:37.425
This will help you heal.

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:39.814
Make you stronger.

01:33:34.902 --> 01:33:36.072
Well...

01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:43.874
It's got water, and...

01:34:06.892 --> 01:34:08.232
It's got water.

01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:27.408
Fuck this. Fuck this.

01:34:40.843 --> 01:34:42.013
God!

01:34:48.309 --> 01:34:50.099
Fuck! Fuck!

01:34:50.227 --> 01:34:51.267
Fuck!

01:34:51.937 --> 01:34:52.937
Shit!

01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:06.788
Fuck! Fuck!

01:35:08.579 --> 01:35:10.119
Fuck!

01:35:10.289 --> 01:35:11.919
Motherfucking...

01:35:16.253 --> 01:35:17.303
Shit!

01:35:18.464 --> 01:35:20.514
Fuck! Fuck!

01:35:48.369 --> 01:35:49.949
Welcome back.

01:35:50.621 --> 01:35:52.516
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.420
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

01:35:54.542 --> 01:35:56.042
her daddy's gone.

01:36:02.174 --> 01:36:03.384
I'd always hoped...

01:36:04.176 --> 01:36:08.636
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

01:36:09.014 --> 01:36:10.684
There's so few of you left.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:15.345
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

01:36:15.521 --> 01:36:16.832
But I really
got to get on my way.

01:36:16.856 --> 01:36:18.066
No, no, don't do that.

01:36:18.232 --> 01:36:20.692
What you need is rest,
and treatment.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:22.379
You need to check yourself
in somewhere.

01:36:22.403 --> 01:36:23.573
I'll be fine.

01:36:23.696 --> 01:36:24.856
No, you're not!

01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.030
I mean, I know
that you're different...

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.469
but that doesn't change the fact

01:36:29.493 --> 01:36:31.503
that something inside you
is poisoning you.

01:36:31.662 --> 01:36:33.872
You got to check yourself
into a hospital.

01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:35.709
Find out what it is!

01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:37.377
I know what it is.

01:36:38.252 --> 01:36:40.502
Please, mister, if you don't
want to go to a hospital,

01:36:40.588 --> 01:36:41.588
maybe I can help you.

01:36:41.755 --> 01:36:43.005
Maybe I can run some tests.

01:36:43.174 --> 01:36:45.554
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

01:36:45.718 --> 01:36:47.388
You wanna save a life,
save your own.

01:36:47.553 --> 01:36:48.603
Forget we were here.

01:36:48.762 --> 01:36:49.852
Let's go.

01:37:01.025 --> 01:37:02.025
Hey!

01:37:02.568 --> 01:37:03.568
Hey!

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:26.089
You can't just take shit,
you know.

01:37:44.610 --> 01:37:46.820
I don't know
how you got me here...

01:37:47.613 --> 01:37:48.783
but thank you.

01:37:48.864 --> 01:37:49.874
<i>De nada.</i>

01:37:50.074 --> 01:37:51.244
Yeah.

01:37:53.118 --> 01:37:54.448
You can talk?

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.830
You can talk?

01:37:58.666 --> 01:38:00.416
What the fuck?

01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:01.746
Why in the fuck...

01:38:01.919 --> 01:38:02.938
What's all this bullshit been

01:38:02.962 --> 01:38:04.922
for the last
2,000 fucking miles?

01:38:07.925 --> 01:38:09.585
What? Shut up.

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:10.930
Shut the fuck up!

01:38:11.011 --> 01:38:13.721
Jonah, Gideon,
Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.

01:38:13.806 --> 01:38:16.096
What? Who's that?

01:38:16.267 --> 01:38:17.427
Who is that?

01:38:18.811 --> 01:38:22.361
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca,
Delilah, and Rictor.

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:23.896
North Dakota.

01:38:24.858 --> 01:38:26.148
What?

01:38:26.277 --> 01:38:27.647
North Dakota, <i>por favor.</i>

01:38:27.778 --> 01:38:28.948
Shit, okay. Look...

01:38:29.029 --> 01:38:30.199
No<i>. Por favor.</i>

01:38:31.824 --> 01:38:33.494
This place. Okay?

01:38:33.659 --> 01:38:34.789
Your nurse,

01:38:34.868 --> 01:38:37.158
she read too many stories,
you understand?

01:38:37.329 --> 01:38:38.869
Too many stories!

01:38:42.710 --> 01:38:45.500
I've seen it!
I've seen it, okay?

01:38:45.671 --> 01:38:46.801
This all here...

01:38:46.964 --> 01:38:48.974
None of this...
No <i>existo,</i> okay?

01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:50.049
You understand me?

01:38:50.217 --> 01:38:51.507
This Eden
does not exist. No!

01:38:51.677 --> 01:38:52.967
<i>Si!</i> Eden!

01:38:53.137 --> 01:38:54.967
It's a fantasy, kid.
See that?

01:38:55.139 --> 01:38:56.157
Those are the names
of the people

01:38:56.181 --> 01:38:57.981
who just made this...

01:38:58.058 --> 01:38:59.848
They made this whole thing up.

01:39:00.352 --> 01:39:01.652
Okay? This whole...

01:39:01.812 --> 01:39:02.812
It happened once,

01:39:02.855 --> 01:39:04.735
and they just turned it
into a big, fucking lie!

01:39:06.066 --> 01:39:07.186
That's all this is. No!

01:39:07.901 --> 01:39:09.031
Fuck.

01:39:09.862 --> 01:39:10.992
No.

01:39:11.488 --> 01:39:13.368
I know, I understand.

01:39:13.741 --> 01:39:15.661
This is a long way.

01:39:15.826 --> 01:39:16.826
You understand?

01:39:16.869 --> 01:39:19.249
I am not taking you
to North Dakota.

01:39:22.416 --> 01:39:25.706
I am fucked up.
And I cannot get you there.

01:39:25.878 --> 01:39:29.008
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

01:39:29.173 --> 01:39:31.883
Don't fucking hit me!

01:39:32.051 --> 01:39:33.051
Don't hit me!

01:39:33.886 --> 01:39:35.046
Jonah, Gideon...

01:39:35.179 --> 01:39:36.323
Stop saying those names.
Rebecca...

01:39:36.347 --> 01:39:37.347
Delilah, Rictor.

01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:38.931
Right now.
Stop saying those names.

01:39:39.058 --> 01:39:40.228
Stop it! Stop!

01:39:40.351 --> 01:39:41.521
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

01:39:41.685 --> 01:39:44.055
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

01:39:44.521 --> 01:39:46.191
You wanna go?

01:39:46.273 --> 01:39:48.113
I'll take you there.

01:39:48.567 --> 01:39:50.067
See for yourself.

01:39:50.402 --> 01:39:52.662
Let's go to fucking fantasyland.

01:40:05.584 --> 01:40:06.936
<i>We understand the importance</i>

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960
<i>of containment, Dr. Rice.</i>

01:40:08.253 --> 01:40:09.397
But you can't leave
a war zone behind

01:40:09.421 --> 01:40:10.421
like you did in Juarez.

01:40:10.589 --> 01:40:11.775
Well, try to remind yourselves

01:40:11.799 --> 01:40:13.193
that these are all
little killing machines.

01:40:13.217 --> 01:40:15.236
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.260
Not all.

01:40:17.429 --> 01:40:19.259
I was told you want
these assets off-board,

01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:20.470
dead or alive.

01:40:20.641 --> 01:40:21.891
Are you changing my brief?

01:40:22.059 --> 01:40:23.099
No.

01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:24.600
All right, then.

01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:27.558
Save tissue from this one.

01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:29.821
He's a good tracker
and had a high IQ.

01:40:35.239 --> 01:40:36.619
Here you go.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.360
Hey.

01:41:22.161 --> 01:41:23.161
Hmm?

01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:24.660
Let me drive.

01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:28.631
Absolutely not.

01:41:34.298 --> 01:41:35.838
Quit looking at me.

01:41:40.262 --> 01:41:41.512
<i>No comprende.</i>

01:41:43.015 --> 01:41:44.515
You are dying.

01:41:47.394 --> 01:41:48.854
You want to die.

01:41:51.732 --> 01:41:53.232
Charles told me.

01:41:56.361 --> 01:41:58.571
What else did he tell you?

01:41:59.031 --> 01:42:00.571
To not let you.

01:42:12.711 --> 01:42:14.551
Hey, hey, hey!

01:42:21.762 --> 01:42:22.762
Rest.

01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:08.854
Keep it steady.

01:45:11.181 --> 01:45:12.771
Swing him toward me.

01:45:15.268 --> 01:45:16.268
Yeah.

01:45:18.855 --> 01:45:21.065
Easy. Easy

01:45:54.266 --> 01:45:55.976
Is this good, Rictor?

01:45:56.435 --> 01:45:57.635
No, not so much. Less.

01:46:03.942 --> 01:46:05.402
Hey!

01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:13.240
Where am I?

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.790
Hey, what is it?

01:46:17.164 --> 01:46:18.464
Where did you get that?

01:46:18.623 --> 01:46:19.963
Where we came from.

01:46:20.625 --> 01:46:21.625
They gave it to us

01:46:21.668 --> 01:46:22.812
when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

01:46:22.836 --> 01:46:24.626
It makes you crazy,
is what it does.

01:46:24.755 --> 01:46:25.755
It'll kill you.

01:46:25.839 --> 01:46:27.839
No, not if you use it
in small doses.

01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:29.798
It's helping you heal.

01:46:31.303 --> 01:46:32.643
Where's Laura?

01:46:32.804 --> 01:46:34.774
She's asleep down there.

01:46:34.931 --> 01:46:36.811
Do you want me to wake her up?

01:46:44.441 --> 01:46:45.651
No.

01:47:06.838 --> 01:47:08.548
You had a nightmare.

01:47:12.385 --> 01:47:14.175
Do you have nightmares?

01:47:15.472 --> 01:47:16.472
<i>Si.</i>

01:47:19.559 --> 01:47:21.309
People hurt me.

01:47:23.355 --> 01:47:24.855
Mine are different.

01:47:31.029 --> 01:47:32.489
I hurt people.

01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:51.880
You know what it is.

01:47:53.718 --> 01:47:55.598
It's made out of Adamantium.

01:47:56.388 --> 01:47:58.598
It's what they put inside of us.

01:47:59.558 --> 01:48:01.348
That's why it can kill us.

01:48:03.186 --> 01:48:05.516
Probably what is killing me now.

01:48:07.566 --> 01:48:08.856
Anyway...

01:48:09.442 --> 01:48:11.192
I got this a long time ago...

01:48:12.571 --> 01:48:16.071
and I kept it as a reminder
of what I am.

01:48:18.285 --> 01:48:20.245
Now I keep it to, uh...

01:48:27.127 --> 01:48:28.417
Actually, uh...

01:48:31.882 --> 01:48:34.132
I was thinking of
shooting myself with it.

01:48:34.759 --> 01:48:36.259
Like Charles said.

01:48:41.975 --> 01:48:43.935
I've hurt people, too.

01:48:46.938 --> 01:48:49.768
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

01:48:59.326 --> 01:49:01.326
They were bad people.

01:49:05.123 --> 01:49:06.793
All the same.

01:50:21.825 --> 01:50:24.075
Not funny.
That is not funny!

01:50:25.704 --> 01:50:27.044
Hey! Hey, pal.

01:50:27.205 --> 01:50:29.535
How long have I been out?

01:50:31.167 --> 01:50:32.447
How long have I been
in that bed?

01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:33.844
Two days.

01:50:34.004 --> 01:50:35.314
You've been sitting here
for two days?

01:50:35.338 --> 01:50:36.899
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

01:50:36.923 --> 01:50:38.643
You can't do that.
You can't just stay here.

01:50:38.675 --> 01:50:40.545
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

01:50:40.719 --> 01:50:43.049
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

01:50:43.221 --> 01:50:44.221
If you keep waiting,

01:50:44.264 --> 01:50:45.866
Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:46.930
You need to get out!

01:50:47.017 --> 01:50:49.097
We're leaving tomorrow
before dawn.

01:50:49.519 --> 01:50:51.099
We're gonna cross the border.

01:50:51.271 --> 01:50:52.901
It's a safe haven.

01:50:54.107 --> 01:50:55.357
Same coordinates?

01:50:55.525 --> 01:50:57.735
<i>Yes, between noon and 5:00.</i>

01:50:57.902 --> 01:51:00.242
<i>Satellites are blind then.</i>

01:51:00.405 --> 01:51:01.485
<i>Your asylum approved.</i>

01:51:01.614 --> 01:51:02.704
Copy.

01:51:18.757 --> 01:51:20.427
Swing it to your right, Laura.

01:51:23.928 --> 01:51:25.758
A little more. Yeah.

01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:27.270
You see the woods?

01:51:29.392 --> 01:51:30.482
<i>Si.</i>

01:51:31.061 --> 01:51:32.541
It's an eight mile hike
through there.

01:51:33.646 --> 01:51:34.766
And you see that pass?

01:51:34.939 --> 01:51:36.109
Mm-hmm.

01:51:36.274 --> 01:51:37.404
That's the border.

01:51:39.277 --> 01:51:41.107
That's where we will be safe.

01:51:48.411 --> 01:51:49.951
Come inside.

01:51:56.795 --> 01:51:58.335
Laura told me
all that you did for her.

01:51:58.797 --> 01:52:00.837
She was lucky to have you.

01:52:03.301 --> 01:52:05.261
Take it.
She says it's yours.

01:52:07.138 --> 01:52:09.678
That's why you did it, right?

01:52:11.935 --> 01:52:13.685
Yeah, well...

01:52:14.479 --> 01:52:17.319
Look, I don't need it.
You do, okay?

01:52:17.649 --> 01:52:19.319
Suit yourself.

01:52:40.964 --> 01:52:42.634
Your friends, they seem nice.

01:52:42.799 --> 01:52:43.839
Kind of reminds me...

01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:46.970
Hey, hey, what's going on?

01:52:47.470 --> 01:52:48.470
Huh?

01:52:50.014 --> 01:52:51.394
You're with your pals.
You made it.

01:52:52.392 --> 01:52:53.892
Where will you go?

01:52:55.019 --> 01:52:56.519
Nearest bar, for starters.

01:52:57.856 --> 01:53:00.316
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

01:53:00.483 --> 01:53:02.363
I even gave back the money.

01:53:02.527 --> 01:53:03.567
Such a nice man.

01:53:03.695 --> 01:53:05.855
Hey, I never asked for this!

01:53:06.573 --> 01:53:08.373
All right?
Charles never asked for this.

01:53:08.533 --> 01:53:10.413
Caliban never asked for this.

01:53:11.202 --> 01:53:13.252
And they are six feet
under the ground!

01:53:14.372 --> 01:53:16.372
Now, I don't know what
Charles put in your head...

01:53:16.541 --> 01:53:19.341
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

01:53:20.712 --> 01:53:23.012
I only met you,
like, a week ago.

01:53:24.215 --> 01:53:26.175
You got your Rebecca,
your Delilah...

01:53:26.342 --> 01:53:28.052
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

01:53:28.219 --> 01:53:29.849
Everything you asked for,
you've got it!

01:53:32.891 --> 01:53:34.771
And it is better this way.

01:53:36.227 --> 01:53:38.187
Because I suck at this.

01:53:39.898 --> 01:53:43.028
Bad shit happens to people
I care about.

01:53:43.193 --> 01:53:44.863
You understand me?

01:53:46.946 --> 01:53:48.446
Then I'll be fine.

01:55:56.451 --> 01:55:59.371
Run!
Towards the mountains! Run!

01:57:09.482 --> 01:57:10.782
Run, Bobby, run!

01:57:15.947 --> 01:57:16.947
Ah!

01:57:34.882 --> 01:57:36.382
Go! Go!

01:57:37.009 --> 01:57:38.009
Move faster!

01:57:38.177 --> 01:57:40.257
We need to reach them before
they get to the border.

01:58:57.089 --> 01:58:58.339
Move out!

01:58:58.508 --> 01:58:59.508
Let's go, let's go!

01:59:01.344 --> 01:59:02.804
Run! Run!

01:59:02.970 --> 01:59:05.560
<i>Corre,</i> Jonah! Run!

01:59:12.146 --> 01:59:13.686
I want you to breathe.

01:59:13.856 --> 01:59:15.146
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

01:59:31.415 --> 01:59:32.415
There she is.

01:59:32.625 --> 01:59:33.665
We got her.

01:59:36.379 --> 01:59:38.459
Back it up! Contain her.

02:00:05.074 --> 02:00:06.124
Get behind me!

02:00:27.638 --> 02:00:29.428
You took all the medicine.

02:00:31.017 --> 02:00:32.227
It's wearing off.

02:00:59.003 --> 02:01:00.343
Go to your friends.

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:02.589
Go.

02:01:04.091 --> 02:01:05.221
Laura?

02:01:07.219 --> 02:01:08.549
You'll know when.

02:01:20.691 --> 02:01:21.941
Nine o'clock.

02:01:23.986 --> 02:01:26.236
That green juice
is wearin' off, huh?

02:01:27.239 --> 02:01:29.779
You know, for an old mute,
it's kind of a short high.

02:01:30.242 --> 02:01:31.792
Be hard to
keep them claws out, soon.

02:01:31.953 --> 02:01:33.793
Waste this dick, Logan!

02:01:35.039 --> 02:01:36.749
Please stop,
Mr. Howlett.

02:01:37.208 --> 02:01:38.310
I'm gonna have to tell these men

02:01:38.334 --> 02:01:39.384
to fire on these children.

02:01:39.543 --> 02:01:40.883
You don't want that.

02:01:41.045 --> 02:01:43.375
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

02:01:43.547 --> 02:01:46.127
You will not survive
further wounds.

02:01:46.384 --> 02:01:47.934
Allow me to introduce myself.

02:01:48.302 --> 02:01:49.302
I'm Zander Rice.

02:01:50.471 --> 02:01:52.561
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

02:01:52.723 --> 02:01:56.273
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

02:01:57.311 --> 02:01:58.771
Yes, he was one of them.

02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:01.939
I think I might have killed him.

02:02:03.275 --> 02:02:04.395
I think you're right.

02:02:04.485 --> 02:02:06.005
Why don't you show
some respect, mutie?

02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:08.030
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

02:02:08.614 --> 02:02:10.534
My friend Donald overstates.

02:02:11.575 --> 02:02:14.285
He makes it sound more brutal
than intended.

02:02:14.453 --> 02:02:17.713
The goal was
not to end mutant kind...

02:02:17.873 --> 02:02:19.173
but to control it.

02:02:21.293 --> 02:02:22.423
I realized

02:02:22.503 --> 02:02:24.147
we needn't stop perfecting
what we eat and drink.

02:02:24.171 --> 02:02:25.232
That we could use those products

02:02:25.256 --> 02:02:26.296
to perfect ourselves.

02:02:27.425 --> 02:02:28.715
To distribute gene therapy

02:02:28.801 --> 02:02:30.141
discreetly through everything...

02:02:30.302 --> 02:02:32.512
from sweet drinks
to breakfast cereals.

02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:33.810
And it worked.

02:02:33.973 --> 02:02:36.483
Random mutancy
went the way of polio.

02:02:36.642 --> 02:02:37.942
We embarked
on our next endeavor.

02:02:38.144 --> 02:02:39.774
Growing mutants of your own.

02:02:39.937 --> 02:02:40.998
Precisely.
Dangerous times, James.

02:02:41.022 --> 02:02:42.022
You can't...

02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.520
Argh!

02:02:44.525 --> 02:02:45.885
Argh!

02:03:01.042 --> 02:03:02.042
Showtime, boy!

02:03:38.746 --> 02:03:40.616
Get up, boy.
Get up, boy!

02:03:45.544 --> 02:03:46.754
He did that. Get up!

02:04:00.101 --> 02:04:01.771
Laura! No!

02:04:06.816 --> 02:04:07.816
Laura!

02:04:55.281 --> 02:04:56.281
Please.

02:05:31.192 --> 02:05:32.192
Ah!

02:05:39.742 --> 02:05:40.782
Go.

02:05:42.578 --> 02:05:43.578
Let's go.

02:05:44.121 --> 02:05:45.121
Go.

02:05:46.582 --> 02:05:48.082
Go, go, go!

02:05:48.792 --> 02:05:51.002
Go! Get out of here! Go!

02:05:54.715 --> 02:05:56.835
Go. Go, go, go!

02:06:01.263 --> 02:06:02.683
Go, go!

02:06:02.890 --> 02:06:03.930
Go!

02:06:04.308 --> 02:06:05.348
Run!

02:06:05.559 --> 02:06:06.559
No!

02:06:07.394 --> 02:06:08.854
No!

02:06:46.517 --> 02:06:47.977
No, no. No.

02:07:12.918 --> 02:07:14.628
Take your friends, and run.

02:07:14.795 --> 02:07:16.005
No.

02:07:16.714 --> 02:07:19.344
Run. They'll keep
coming and coming.

02:07:19.508 --> 02:07:22.178
Listen, you don't have
to fight anymore.

02:07:26.432 --> 02:07:28.522
Go, go.

02:07:36.066 --> 02:07:38.106
Don't be what they made you.

02:07:46.118 --> 02:07:48.328
Laura... Laura...

02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:53.880
Daddy.

02:08:01.342 --> 02:08:05.762
So, this is what it feels like.

02:08:08.015 --> 02:08:09.015
No!

02:08:16.899 --> 02:08:17.899
No!

02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:32.710
Daddy.

02:08:33.415 --> 02:08:34.415
Dad.

02:09:06.323 --> 02:09:09.163
"A man has to be
what he is, Joey.

02:09:10.536 --> 02:09:12.196
"Can't break the mold.

02:09:15.082 --> 02:09:17.582
"There's no living
with a killing.

02:09:18.710 --> 02:09:20.630
"There's no going back.

02:09:22.798 --> 02:09:24.678
"Right or wrong, it's a brand.

02:09:25.551 --> 02:09:27.471
"A brand that sticks.

02:09:30.514 --> 02:09:32.854
"Now you run on home
to your mother.

02:09:34.059 --> 02:09:37.519
"You tell her
everything's all right.

02:09:39.106 --> 02:09:42.436
"There are no more guns
in the valley."

02:09:59.293 --> 02:10:01.303
Let's go.
We gotta move.

02:11:17.204 --> 02:11:20.924
<i>There's a man goin' 'round
takin' names</i>

02:11:21.917 --> 02:11:25.747
<i>And he decides who to free
and who to blame</i>

02:11:27.464 --> 02:11:30.804
<i>Everybody won't be treated
all the same</i>

02:11:32.177 --> 02:11:35.307
<i>There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down</i>

02:11:38.392 --> 02:11:40.942
<i>When the man comes around</i>

02:11:44.690 --> 02:11:48.320
<i>The hairs on your arm
will stand up</i>

02:11:49.611 --> 02:11:53.241
<i>At the terror in each sip
and in each sup</i>

02:11:54.783 --> 02:11:58.123
<i>For you partake
of that last offered cup</i>

02:11:59.663 --> 02:12:03.213
<i>Or disappear
into the potter's ground</i>

02:12:05.711 --> 02:12:07.711
<i>When the man comes around</i>

02:12:09.840 --> 02:12:12.550
<i>Hear the trumpets
hear the pipers</i>

02:12:14.344 --> 02:12:17.474
<i>One hundred million
angels singing</i>

02:12:19.558 --> 02:12:24.228
<i>Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum</i>

02:12:25.772 --> 02:12:28.982
<i>Voices callin', voices cryin'</i>

02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:33.864
<i>Some are born an' some are dyin'</i>

02:12:35.157 --> 02:12:38.867
<i>It's Alpha's and Omega's
kingdom come</i>

02:12:40.037 --> 02:12:44.247
<i>And the whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

02:12:45.375 --> 02:12:48.625
<i>The virgins are all
trimming their wicks</i>

02:12:50.297 --> 02:12:54.637
<i>The whirlwind
is in the thorn tree</i>

02:12:55.177 --> 02:12:58.757
<i>It's hard for thee
to kick against the pricks</i>

02:13:02.351 --> 02:13:06.021
<i>Till Armageddon
no Shalam, no Shalom</i>

02:13:07.397 --> 02:13:10.937
<i>Then the father hen will
call his chickens home</i>

02:13:12.444 --> 02:13:15.614
<i>The wise men will bow down
before the throne</i>

02:13:17.324 --> 02:13:20.744
<i>And at his feet they'll
cast their golden crown</i>

02:13:23.413 --> 02:13:25.793
<i>When the man comes around</i>

02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:31.880
<i>Whoever is unjust
let him be unjust still</i>

02:13:32.631 --> 02:13:36.891
<i>Whoever is righteous
let him be righteous still</i>

02:13:37.177 --> 02:13:41.717
<i>Whoever is filthy
let him be filthy still</i>

02:13:42.182 --> 02:13:45.352
<i>Listen to the words
long written down</i>

02:13:47.896 --> 02:13:50.226
<i>When the man comes around</i>

02:13:51.983 --> 02:13:55.283
<i>Hear the trumpets
hear the pipers</i>

02:13:56.488 --> 02:13:59.408
<i>One hundred million
angels singin'</i>

02:14:01.827 --> 02:14:06.747
<i>Multitudes are marchin'
to the big kettle drum</i>

02:14:07.958 --> 02:14:11.168

and penny pound</i>
