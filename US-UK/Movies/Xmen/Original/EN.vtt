00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:56.182
– You're always sick.
– You were sick when you were my age.

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:02.521
– Evening, sir.
– Evening, Victor.

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:05.858
I didn't realize you were still here.

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.363
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's all right.

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:13.866
Very kind of you.

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:17.828
– Any better, Son?
– Still cold, Father.

00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:19.705
Just a mild fever.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.000
– You'll be all right in the morning.
– You always say that.

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:25.378
And you always pull through, don't you?

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:28.881
– Yeah.
– Now, you taking your medicine?

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.427
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.347
– Your father's drunk again.
– Elizabeth!

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.810
– You should help him home, Victor.
– It's not my name he's calling, sir.

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:44.063
– Father!
– Stay where you are, James.

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.023
– Get off me! – Father!

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:49.193
Now! You never loved him!

00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:52.363
I told you never to come back here.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:00.579
Get out!

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:13.676
James?

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.267
– No. – James?

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.313
– There are things you don't understand.
– Don't.

00:02:24.353 --> 00:02:25.980
– I need him to know!
– Please don't.

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:28.024
– No more lies. – James...

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:47.793
– No! – James!

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.594
He... He wasn't your father,

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:06.270
Son.

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:16.614
What are you?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.965
– I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
– Yes, you did!

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:39.011
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.850
We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that?

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:47.853
And brothers protect each other.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:51.941
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.569
– I want to go home. – We can't.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:58.239
We stick together, no matter what,

00:03:58.322 --> 00:04:01.450
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:04.036
Can you do that, little brother?

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:08.833
– I'm going down to the river.
– They're coming.

00:04:08.916 --> 00:04:11.752
– Head over the hill. Hurry!
– Can you run?

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:19.677
– Keep on running and don't look back.
– Okay.

00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:23.741
Back to back!

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:22.466
That's enough!

00:06:25.052 --> 00:06:26.303
Enough!

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:41.110
No! No!

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.154
Stand down, soldier!

00:06:49.952 --> 00:06:51.370
Victor!

00:06:54.498 --> 00:06:55.916
Stand down! Stand down!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.335
Stand down!

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.007
No!

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:32.036
Ready, aim...

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.455
Wake me when it's over.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.007
Fire!

00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:54.391
Freaks! You're animals! Freaks!

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.810
My name is Major William Stryker.

00:07:56.894 --> 00:08:00.022
You've been charged
with killing a senior officer.

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.024
Is that correct?

00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:04.276
Apparently, we have some issues
with authority...

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.071
– Just keep a lid on it.
– ...sir.

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.995
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.910
at 1000 hours.

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.204
– How'd that go? – It tickled.

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:24.588
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:28.050
– What do you care?
– Oh, I care.

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.387
I care because I know how special you are.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.180
How valuable.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:41.438
Look, you can stay here
locked up like freaks of nature,

00:08:42.564 --> 00:08:44.358
or you can join me.

00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:49.113
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

00:08:50.114 --> 00:08:54.451
Now, tell me, how would you like
to really serve your country?

00:09:08.632 --> 00:09:09.651
You know, I love this weapon

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:11.277
more than any other thing
in the whole wide world.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.303
– Do you wanna know why? – No.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:15.722
It's memorable.

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:17.891
Sure, it's a little bulky,
tough to get on a plane.

00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:21.520
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.897
they will never, ever forget it.

00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:25.774
That's funny, Wade.

00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:29.236
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.072
Right, it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:36.034
or bone claws
or the fingernails of a bag lady.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.005
– Manicure? – Victor. Easy.

00:09:50.591 --> 00:09:53.343
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:57.264
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her last night.

00:09:57.514 --> 00:10:00.100
– I love her.
– You love her after one night?

00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:01.810
She's a gymnast.

00:10:03.187 --> 00:10:05.063
Bradley, take her down.

00:10:09.693 --> 00:10:11.779
Oh, God.

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.781
– Are you gonna puke?
– If we were meant to fly,

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:15.616
– we'd grow wings.
– Don't worry, Nancy.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.119
– More people die driving than flying.
– How about from impaling?

00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:22.331
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:25.793
– Would you like a bucket? – No.

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.045
Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five.

00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:08.126
– Why are we here?
– All in good time. Zero?

00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:17.886
– Intruder! Perimeter breach!
– Man the weapon!

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:23.475
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

00:11:52.963 --> 00:11:54.548
Having fun yet?

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.638
– Fred? – The tank?

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:04.850
– The tank. – Yeah, I got that.

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:44.264
Great. Stuck in an elevator
with five guys on a high-protein diet.

00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.183
– Wade.
– Dreams really do come true.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:47.309
Just shut it!

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:50.395
– You're up next. – Thank you, sir.
You look really nice today.

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.981
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:57.027
– Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal?
– No. Not when I'm awake.

00:12:57.903 --> 00:13:00.030
Bradley? Top floor, please.

00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:10.999
Cover the elevator! The elevator!

00:13:20.842 --> 00:13:22.678
Time to go to work.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:02.342
Okay. People are dead.

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:09.349
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier.

00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:17.190
I wouldn't do that if I was you, brother.

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:25.782
– Take the diamonds. They're yours.
– I don't want your diamonds.

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:28.577
I want this.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:32.289
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.834
Where did you find it? I want the source.

00:14:36.835 --> 00:14:41.631
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.721
Tell him this rock is
more valuable to me than his life.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:49.848
Ask him where he found it.

00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:02.069
Okay.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.030
He says it came from the sky.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.077
He's telling the truth.

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:13.747
You don't know the language, Logan.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.916
– It's a meteor fragment.
– I know what it is.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.418
I'm asking him where he found it.

00:15:18.502 --> 00:15:21.004
Sir, base wants to know our location.

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:23.340
– Shut them down. – Yes.

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:27.761
Tell him everyone here will die

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.847
unless he tells me
where he found the rock.

00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.652
– He says that it's sacred.
– Okay, fine.

00:15:47.405 --> 00:15:48.824
Victor.

00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:07.259
Victor!

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.056
Don't even think about it.

00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:16.560
We didn't sign up for this.

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:21.731
Put him down!

00:16:34.244 --> 00:16:36.037
What are you doing?

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.850
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.668
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:43.879
Who do you think you are?

00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:45.922
This is what we do.

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:48.925
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:52.762
till they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

00:16:53.263 --> 00:16:54.723
I'm done.

00:16:57.142 --> 00:16:58.602
You coming?

00:17:05.275 --> 00:17:06.568
Jimmy!

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.409
We can't just let you walk away.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.127
Jimmy!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.340
Jimmy!

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:19.808
Why are you up so early?

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.812
Come here.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.935
See you, baby.

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:06.396
Hey.

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:16.031
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.200
You're wrapped, man.

00:19:37.093 --> 00:19:39.971
Okay, I'm totally gonna get this.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.184
Nope. Come on.

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:48.188
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.689
– How does he do it? – Come on.

00:19:49.773 --> 00:19:51.399
Amazing lady in a box!

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.744
Swing the hammer, ring the bell!

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.704
Hey, what do you do?

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.250
If you turn off the light, you win a prize.

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:13.046
– Three tries for a buck.
– Come on, I wanna do it.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.381
There you go. Okay?

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:21.554
No, that's obvious.

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:26.726
That's two.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.570
Well, that's a stupid trick.

00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.989
It's not a trick, man.

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:42.492
Come on. Freak.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.662
Bye.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.650
Show's over!

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.199
I said show's over!

00:21:28.163 --> 00:21:30.707
The show's never over for us, Bradley.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:35.879
– Victor.
– Aren't you gonna invite me in?

00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:40.550
Yeah. Come on in.

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:58.109
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.362
I'm living a totally
different life now, Victor.

00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.740
No need to bring up the past.

00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:20.340
You know,

00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:25.762
I always thought it would
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:29.432
Well... Well,

00:22:30.475 --> 00:22:31.935
Wade's gone.

00:22:35.438 --> 00:22:37.565
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:42.278
I'm not afraid of dying.

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.198
How do you know?

00:22:46.449 --> 00:22:48.660
You've never tried it before.

00:23:05.843 --> 00:23:07.762
Was it the wars?

00:23:09.222 --> 00:23:10.640
Which one?

00:23:11.182 --> 00:23:12.642
All of them.

00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:23.361
– Tell me. – Hey.

00:23:24.195 --> 00:23:26.030
It's just a scratch.

00:23:33.371 --> 00:23:36.374
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:37.875
Yeah.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.569
Who the hell is this?

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.613
Smells like government.

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:13.244
My God. Haven't aged a day!

00:24:13.328 --> 00:24:14.871
Clean living.

00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:19.917
– You remember Agent Zero? – Still
shooting first, asking questions later?

00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:25.673
– You still chewing on cheap cigars?
– Boys, please.

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.427
– I have a job for you.
– I already have a job.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.638
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:35.141
18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone
in a while.

00:24:35.224 --> 00:24:37.185
– Starting to miss it?
– Right about now I am.

00:24:37.268 --> 00:24:39.562
– Yeah? – Zero, back to the car.

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:44.609
Attaboy.

00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:54.494
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

00:24:54.577 --> 00:24:56.496
Conversation's over.

00:24:57.455 --> 00:25:01.084
Playing <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>
with a schoolteacher,

00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:03.294
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

00:25:03.461 --> 00:25:05.505
And you would know, huh?

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.466
– I would.
– What do you want, Stryker?

00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:13.096
Bradley was killed three days ago.

00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:15.765
Wade before that.

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:19.811
I believe that someone is hunting down
our old team.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.774
– Anyone else?
– As far as I know, Victor is safe.

00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:29.362
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:31.489
I can take care of myself.

00:25:33.449 --> 00:25:35.702
This is not about you, Logan.

00:25:39.163 --> 00:25:41.124
Your country needs you.

00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:43.626
I'm Canadian.

00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:47.463
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:04.981
– Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did.
– What did you do?

00:26:16.325 --> 00:26:18.494
Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye!

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:26.878
What's wrong?

00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:31.174
Stryker came by today.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.760
Don't worry. I said no.

00:26:33.843 --> 00:26:36.846
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:39.265
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:40.975
but what I do best isn't very nice.

00:26:41.058 --> 00:26:44.770
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:47.690
A gift. You can return a gift.

00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:02.580
Come on, fellas.

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:05.208
All right.

00:27:05.708 --> 00:27:07.376
Stay in the car.

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:10.046
I'm just gonna ask nicely.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.093
You mind letting us go by?

00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:18.489
– You in some kind of a hurry there, pal?
– Hey, hey, hey.

00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:19.805
Are you?

00:27:19.889 --> 00:27:21.200
Just move your truck so we can go by.

00:27:21.224 --> 00:27:23.351
We're trying to have
a conversation there, all right?

00:27:23.434 --> 00:27:25.645
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

00:27:25.728 --> 00:27:27.063
Listen...

00:27:27.146 --> 00:27:30.107
Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down.

00:27:34.654 --> 00:27:37.657
– Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
– I know.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.661
Big temper, too. So please let us pass.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.835
– Thank you.
– Come on, man, let's go.

00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:52.421
How'd you do that?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.508
Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.970
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:01.931
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.117
Why is the moon so lonely?

00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:23.619
Why?

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.414
Because she used to have a lover.

00:28:26.497 --> 00:28:28.916
– You tell this to the kids?
– No.

00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:32.878
His name was Kuekuatsheu and they
lived in the Spirit World together.

00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:35.965
Oh, this is a true story? All right.

00:28:36.048 --> 00:28:38.801
And every night they would
wander the skies together,

00:28:40.428 --> 00:28:44.015
but one of the other spirits was jealous.

00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:48.060
Trickster wanted the moon for himself,

00:28:48.603 --> 00:28:52.315
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:56.736
He told him to come to our world
and pick her some wild roses,

00:28:56.986 --> 00:29:01.032
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the Spirit World,

00:29:01.782 --> 00:29:03.701
you can never go back.

00:29:04.702 --> 00:29:10.583
And every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

00:29:13.836 --> 00:29:15.087
But

00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.717
he can never touch her again.

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:21.636
Wow.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.680
Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed.

00:29:26.557 --> 00:29:28.184
"Kuekuatsheu."

00:29:34.732 --> 00:29:36.817
It means "the Wolverine".

00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:39.130
What you doing, Logan?

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:48.514
Kayla.

00:31:32.641 --> 00:31:33.976
Oh, God.

00:31:35.061 --> 00:31:36.312
Kayla!

00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:43.212
You're not from around here, are you?

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.927
What gave me away?

00:32:51.887 --> 00:32:53.305
Victor!

00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:58.602
– You got insurance on this place?
– Insurance? No.

00:32:59.979 --> 00:33:02.690
– Too bad. – Victor!

00:33:16.328 --> 00:33:20.082
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

00:33:20.583 --> 00:33:23.419
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:35.931
Why?

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:38.434
Why?

00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.983
You don't call. You don't write.

00:33:48.027 --> 00:33:51.030
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:33.322
I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

00:34:35.658 --> 00:34:37.159
Stay down.

00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:17.700
Tell me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.681
When are you gonna figure it out?

00:35:41.557 --> 00:35:43.392
We're not like them.

00:35:45.227 --> 00:35:47.479
I am nothing like you.

00:35:49.356 --> 00:35:50.899
Sure, you are.

00:35:52.151 --> 00:35:54.236
You just don't know it yet.

00:36:08.292 --> 00:36:11.587
– What do we got?
– Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

00:36:13.756 --> 00:36:15.841
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.193
– Where is he?
– Hey, hey, don't...

00:36:17.217 --> 00:36:19.178
– I said, where is he?
– I don't know who he is.

00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:21.055
I can help you.

00:36:27.603 --> 00:36:29.521
Six years I've been here.

00:36:29.605 --> 00:36:33.359
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:34.777
I tried to warn you.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.862
Why didn't you tell me it was Victor?

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:39.156
– I didn't know! – Bullshit!

00:36:39.865 --> 00:36:45.204
– Why?
– I swear on my son's life, I didn't!

00:36:52.628 --> 00:36:54.838
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

00:36:54.922 --> 00:36:57.925
I had to lock him up.
He felt I betrayed him.

00:36:58.675 --> 00:37:01.970
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:04.640
You didn't come to warn me,

00:37:04.723 --> 00:37:07.017
you came to save your own ass.

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.269
So what's your plan, Captain?

00:37:09.353 --> 00:37:11.480
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:13.982
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

00:37:15.025 --> 00:37:17.820
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

00:37:21.615 --> 00:37:23.492
And we can still save the others.

00:37:23.575 --> 00:37:25.869
You mean save yourself, right?

00:37:27.788 --> 00:37:29.748
I promise you two things.

00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:33.043
You will suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

00:37:33.127 --> 00:37:35.504
but you will have your revenge.

00:37:37.923 --> 00:37:41.176
I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

00:37:42.886 --> 00:37:45.597
No law. No code of conduct.

00:37:46.306 --> 00:37:50.227
You point me in the right direction,
you get the hell out of my way.

00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:34.104
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:37.900
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

00:38:37.983 --> 00:38:40.527
Trust me, I've been through worse.

00:38:40.611 --> 00:38:42.404
No, you haven't.

00:38:43.363 --> 00:38:44.865
We're ready.

00:38:46.742 --> 00:38:51.497
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

00:38:54.583 --> 00:38:57.669
You remember
what we were looking for in Africa?

00:38:57.753 --> 00:39:00.255
– I remember.
– Well, I found it.

00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:06.345
It helped us create
a metal compound so strong

00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:09.097
that you will be able to withstand
virtually anything.

00:39:09.181 --> 00:39:11.266
It's called Adamantium.

00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:15.771
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

00:39:16.897 --> 00:39:20.943
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

00:39:23.612 --> 00:39:25.364
Become the animal.

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:29.117
Let's do this.

00:39:29.576 --> 00:39:31.245
I almost forgot.

00:39:34.706 --> 00:39:36.375
I want new ones.

00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:39.127
What do you want them to say?

00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:41.630
Wolverine.

00:39:59.356 --> 00:40:01.275
Generals, welcome.

00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.444
General Munson.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:08.365
Today we're gonna witness
medical history.

00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:11.535
– Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
– X?

00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:14.204
Roman numeral 10.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.836
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

00:40:22.004 --> 00:40:23.505
Let's begin.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.220
– We're brothers, Jimmy.
<i>– Logan!</i>

00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:14.848
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:20.228
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

00:41:20.312 --> 00:41:23.774
He feels pain just like the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:27.611
– That's why he had to volunteer.
– Heart rate, 190. 195.

00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:30.197
– Will he survive this?
– I don't know.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.740
200.

00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:35.327
Son.

00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:38.205
Heart rate well beyond maximum.

00:41:38.288 --> 00:41:41.249
– Blood pressure?
– 260 over 180 and rising.

00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:43.669
He can make it. He can make it.

00:41:48.048 --> 00:41:49.257
Victor!

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.139
<i>I love you.</i>

00:41:56.223 --> 00:41:57.849
<i>You're not an animal.</i>

00:42:04.398 --> 00:42:06.108
It means "the Wolverine".

00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:35.053
Well, I guess he can die.

00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:08.545
Come on, old friend. Come back.

00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:13.759
Heart rate rising.

00:43:15.177 --> 00:43:17.637
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:20.515
No rejection. Procedure completed.

00:43:20.891 --> 00:43:23.185
– We did it. – We did it.

00:43:27.898 --> 00:43:29.441
Yeah! Yes.

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:32.527
Are we taking him to the island?

00:43:32.611 --> 00:43:34.404
The island? No.

00:43:36.114 --> 00:43:37.991
The bonding works.

00:43:38.074 --> 00:43:40.368
We'll use his DNA for the XI.

00:43:43.163 --> 00:43:44.915
Erase his memory.

00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:50.170
Erase his memory.

00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:01.598
I think he heard you.

00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:18.448
Lock down!

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.405
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

00:45:40.113 --> 00:45:41.489
Travis.

00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:54.836
– I think there's a naked man in the barn.
– Yep.

00:46:26.534 --> 00:46:27.786
Son?

00:46:29.037 --> 00:46:30.997
What in hell you doing?

00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:33.958
– It's cold. – Cold.

00:46:39.047 --> 00:46:41.633
– You got no clothes on. – Yeah.

00:46:42.926 --> 00:46:45.720
– You're not on the drugs, are you?
– No.

00:46:47.097 --> 00:46:50.725
– No, just had a rough night.
– Yeah, you could say that.

00:46:53.979 --> 00:46:55.981
Come on up to the house.

00:46:56.064 --> 00:46:59.526
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

00:46:59.609 --> 00:47:02.070
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:06.074
I don't want you giving
the old lady a heart attack.

00:47:51.828 --> 00:47:54.956
– You all right in there?
– Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

00:47:56.124 --> 00:47:58.042
Supper's on the table.

00:47:58.626 --> 00:48:00.295
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

00:48:11.765 --> 00:48:14.017
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:19.105
– Set it down over there.
– Right.

00:48:22.692 --> 00:48:24.652
Come and sit down, son.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.286
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:36.539
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

00:48:36.623 --> 00:48:38.500
– "Decent." – What?

00:48:40.502 --> 00:48:43.630
Nothing. I'm just not
really used to that word.

00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:48.218
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:50.637
– You know motorcycles?
– Oh! Lord, here we go.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.390
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the line.

00:48:54.474 --> 00:48:56.559
I think you're a little
young for that, son.

00:48:56.643 --> 00:48:59.687
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:01.231
In the barn.

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.818
Nothing you can break out there.

00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:22.544
<i>Why is the moon so lonely?</i>

00:49:22.627 --> 00:49:24.045
<i>Why?</i>

00:49:24.546 --> 00:49:27.006
<i>Because she used to have a lover.</i>

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.261
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

00:49:51.739 --> 00:49:53.366
You sleep okay?

00:49:55.577 --> 00:49:56.870
Yeah.

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:01.499
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:07.463
You know what happens
to men who go looking for blood?

00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:10.758
– What? – They find it.

00:50:14.429 --> 00:50:16.514
We all got a choice, son.

00:50:16.598 --> 00:50:20.018
– Yeah, well, mine got taken.
– Bullshit.

00:50:24.022 --> 00:50:26.065
This was my son's jacket.

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.777
Try it on.

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.130
– Thank you. – Yep.

00:50:50.173 --> 00:50:54.552
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

00:50:55.887 --> 00:50:57.305
'64, huh?

00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:01.768
Man, you're heavy.

00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:04.103
Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

00:51:04.187 --> 00:51:06.356
– Good morning! – Good morning.

00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:11.402
Oh. It fits you beautifully.

00:51:13.655 --> 00:51:15.156
I brought you some...

00:51:24.707 --> 00:51:27.585
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civilians.

00:51:27.669 --> 00:51:31.089
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

00:51:54.737 --> 00:51:56.197
Come get me.

00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:10.378
Blow his brains all over the road!

00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:11.796
Damn it!

00:52:48.124 --> 00:52:50.293
Alpha one, do not lose him!

00:52:58.217 --> 00:53:00.678
Alpha two! Target coming to you!

00:53:51.521 --> 00:53:52.897
Pull up!

00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:26.013
Pull back! Pull back!

00:54:44.699 --> 00:54:46.117
<i>Zero?</i>

00:54:48.953 --> 00:54:50.580
<i>Zero, come in.</i>

00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:55.251
<i>Zero?</i>

00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:03.759
<i>– Zero, is Logan dead?</i>
– I don't know.

00:55:04.177 --> 00:55:05.595
I'm down.

00:55:07.763 --> 00:55:10.099
<i>Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead?</i>

00:55:14.562 --> 00:55:16.230
<i>Zero, come in.</i>

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:22.612
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:24.989
– Logan? – Where's Victor?

00:55:25.072 --> 00:55:26.782
Come back to base.

00:55:27.283 --> 00:55:29.178
I'll explain everything.
We'll take Victor down together.

00:55:29.202 --> 00:55:32.955
Wrong answer.
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you.

00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:37.835
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:41.797
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna like what you find.

00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:45.927
You wanted the animal, Colonel.
You got it.

00:55:50.932 --> 00:55:54.936
Those were good people back there.
Innocent people.

00:56:05.112 --> 00:56:08.950
It's funny how good, innocent people tend
to die around you.

00:56:29.804 --> 00:56:31.889
Zero never stood a chance.

00:56:32.265 --> 00:56:36.102
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet.

00:56:43.568 --> 00:56:46.529
This facility's compromised.
Prep transport.

00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:57.582
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

00:56:57.665 --> 00:57:00.251
– Don't worry. We'll stop him.
– Really?

00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:04.338
You just spent half a billion dollars
making him indestructible.

00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:07.675
– Sir? – Yes?

00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:11.554
The young mutant you've been looking for.
We've found him.

00:57:11.637 --> 00:57:14.015
General, Logan isn't
the only piece of this puzzle.

00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:16.267
I need to evacuate this facility.

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:19.854
Please go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

00:57:22.815 --> 00:57:25.609
<i>Yo hablo,</i> I talk. <i>Tú hablas,</i> you talk.

00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:28.112
<i>Él habla...</i> Somebody translate.

00:57:29.322 --> 00:57:30.531
Summers!

00:57:31.032 --> 00:57:33.451
Sit up and take off those glasses.

00:57:34.869 --> 00:57:36.537
I have a headache.

00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:39.582
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

00:57:39.665 --> 00:57:42.752
while you write out this conjugation
100 times.

00:57:42.835 --> 00:57:44.754
– Somebody else? – He talks.

00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:46.881
Thank you. He talks. <i>Él habla.</i>

00:57:58.434 --> 00:58:00.728
– You sure it was Victor?
– Yeah.

00:58:02.355 --> 00:58:04.774
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:10.654
What the hell happened to him after I left?

00:58:10.738 --> 00:58:13.991
He got worse.
He felt like you abandoned him.

00:58:14.075 --> 00:58:15.785
Hell, we all did.

00:58:16.243 --> 00:58:19.664
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:22.917
Hunting and killing
everything he was pointed at.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.252
Quit a few months later myself.

00:58:25.336 --> 00:58:27.671
Couldn't take rounding them up.

00:58:28.047 --> 00:58:30.466
– Rounding who up?
– Leave it alone.

00:58:30.966 --> 00:58:32.927
Rounding who up, John?

00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:35.346
Hey! Damn it, John!

00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:37.682
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

00:58:38.265 --> 00:58:40.684
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:43.771
Mutants? Why?

00:58:44.772 --> 00:58:47.566
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.277
protecting people from the bad ones.

00:58:58.285 --> 00:59:01.163
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

00:59:01.247 --> 00:59:05.710
– Remember that stuff in Africa?
– Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it?

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:10.297
Damn.

00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:13.968
What'd they do to you, man?

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.678
Don't ask.

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.650
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

00:59:19.682 --> 00:59:21.225
Does that mean anything to you?

00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:23.602
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:26.647
– Him and Zero were real tight.
– Fred Dukes? Where is he?

00:59:26.731 --> 00:59:28.250
– He's here.
– Well, let's go talk to him.

00:59:28.274 --> 00:59:31.318
Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00.

00:59:31.402 --> 00:59:34.738
But I got to warn you, he developed
a bit of an eating disorder.

00:59:34.822 --> 00:59:39.076
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.579
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.374
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

00:59:45.458 --> 00:59:48.419
I told him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

00:59:51.547 --> 00:59:54.175
Fred Dukes? That looks like
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

00:59:54.258 --> 00:59:56.135
Hey, be nice, man.

00:59:57.845 --> 00:59:59.847
Hey, fat... Fred.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:04.518
I seem to remember that girl
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:08.481
Oh, that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:10.691
You know where Victor is?

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:14.069
– No idea.
– What's the island, slim?

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.617
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:21.052
Listen, I ain't leaving here
till you tell me where Victor is.

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.996
So come on, bub, for old times' sake, huh?

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:28.918
Did you just call me Blob?

01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:32.213
No, but...

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:40.804
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you call him Blob?

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:43.307
I didn't call him Blob. I said "bub".

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.643
– God damn it.
– Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:47.102
I got an idea.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.124
– This is your idea of an idea?
– I'm trying to help you out, Logan.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:52.792
Dukes don't like you that much
and you know it.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.136
– Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
– Well, use them gloves, man.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:59.406
Dance with him a little bit.
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.493
Figure if you do that, he'll probably
tell you everything you want to know.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.370
Come on, man, look at him.

01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:07.164
Got a big old ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:09.667
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:12.586
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.733
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here on a stretcher.

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.260
– You're an asshole.
– Come on, Logan.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.472
– Whup his ass! – You want it?

01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:25.474
Dance with him, Fred!
Just like I taught you.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:27.184
You want to dance with me?

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:30.062
– Come on, Fred!
– Oh! Oh, that feels good.

01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:34.942
Hey! Guess what?

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.736
See, he gonna talk now.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.257
– You got him right where you want him.
– Whose side are you on, anyway?

01:01:40.281 --> 01:01:41.782
Come on!

01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:44.368
Come on, now, lamb chop!

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:01.135
Damn!

01:02:15.774 --> 01:02:17.318
Now, where's Victor?

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.769
Little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

01:03:07.368 --> 01:03:11.705
– Please, don't! Please, don't!
– Victor!

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.670
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:24.551
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island.

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:27.096
They run it together.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.266
What? They what?
Victor will be with Stryker?

01:03:32.184 --> 01:03:33.352
Yeah.

01:03:34.061 --> 01:03:36.063
You didn't know that?

01:03:56.083 --> 01:04:00.504
All that's left now is Logan.
I trust you can handle that.

01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:05.592
– I did before, didn't I?
– Oh, yes. You did that.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:12.266
Our deal. It still applies, right?

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.730
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.449
What's the island?

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:33.370
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:36.707
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:39.752
Mutants.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:44.673
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.928
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:51.805
I tried not to.

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:11.575
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:17.706
They killed her for a goddamn experiment.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:26.089
– Where is it? Where is it?
– Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

01:05:30.636 --> 01:05:34.640
But a prisoner escaped there once.

01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:37.184
– Who?
– His name was Remy LeBeau.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.520
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.439
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:43.958
because he kept taking
all their money at poker.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.943
– That's all I know.
– What's Stryker up to, Fred?

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:47.778
What's the endgame?

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.284
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:57.204
That's all I know, Logan.
That's all I know.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:01.542
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.464
I'm coming with you, Logan.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:11.677
– There's no redemption where I'm going.
– I ain't asking.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.091
There's our dude.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.057
That's cool.

01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:01.185
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

01:07:01.268 --> 01:07:03.395
– I'm not gonna fight with him.
– Yeah, right.

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.522
What? I get in fights with everybody?

01:07:05.606 --> 01:07:07.733
Don't dogs kill cats?

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:10.277
Just go cover the back, will you?

01:07:14.281 --> 01:07:16.783
– Give me 500. – I'm in.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.458
Are you Remy LeBeau?

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:28.879
– Do I owe you money? – No.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.424
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:53.862
Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50.

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:58.825
– May I deal you in?
– What can I get for 17 bucks?

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.203
$17?

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.831
A cab ride home, perhaps?

01:08:09.378 --> 01:08:12.089
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.257
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.426
And your creepy black coat
don't scare me.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:17.761
Really?

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.430
Worked on Dukes.

01:08:20.514 --> 01:08:22.834
You shouldn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kill you

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.977
before Logan even gets a chance.

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.813
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

01:08:27.896 --> 01:08:29.481
Victor Creed.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:33.652
And who's that?

01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:35.487
The man I'm gonna kill.

01:08:37.239 --> 01:08:40.575
He works with a man named Stryker
on an island.

01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:45.580
– Just need to know where it is.
– And why would you think I know that?

01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:48.542
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:54.339
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

01:08:55.382 --> 01:08:59.052
You know, John, there's something
I always wanted to tell you.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:08.186
You're predictable.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.483
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

01:09:14.443 --> 01:09:17.195
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:24.119
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.582
The men who took me wore
tags just like them.

01:09:32.252 --> 01:09:34.629
Hey, now, bub, you listen to me.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:54.149
Damn it. That little...

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:11.708
Two years I rotted in that hellhole
and I ain't never going back.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.297
Shiny.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.135
Tell me something, Jimmy.

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:25.180
Do you even know how to kill me?

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.974
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:30.519
See if that works.

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.489
You're getting slow, old man.

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.166
You son of a bitch.

01:10:56.795 --> 01:10:59.673
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

01:11:23.864 --> 01:11:25.157
Victor!

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:37.210
Well, that's a nice stick.

01:12:35.644 --> 01:12:38.188
Okay, shithead, here's the deal.

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.608
See, you're gonna take me to this island,
where I can kill Creed, Stryker

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.904
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this world. Do you understand?

01:12:46.571 --> 01:12:48.198
You're really gonna kill them?

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:51.117
As long as you stay out of my way, yeah.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.633
Colonel?

01:13:07.175 --> 01:13:09.427
– General? – Is this Weapon XI?

01:13:11.972 --> 01:13:14.891
All their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:16.893
You really hate them, don't you?

01:13:16.977 --> 01:13:18.853
No, I don't hate them.

01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:23.525
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:31.491
We can win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process.

01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:35.120
Pre-emptive action is
the only action here, General.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:38.957
The days of our country
sitting on the sidelines are over.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:43.962
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:46.881
– I admire your passion, I do.
– Thank you.

01:13:47.674 --> 01:13:49.968
But this is as far as it goes.

01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:54.514
– Weapon X was a hiccup.
– We know about your son, Bill.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:58.727
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he killed your wife.

01:13:58.810 --> 01:14:01.855
– You shouldn't have kept that from us.
– That...

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:05.158
That has nothing
to do with my work, General.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:06.526
Bullshit.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.155
You're too close to this.
I'm shutting you down.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:15.327
Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:22.459
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.712
but I took an oath

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.507
to protect the American people

01:14:30.592 --> 01:14:33.553
from every threat, both foreign

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.355
and domestic.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.114
– You don't like flying, huh?
– I'm fine.

01:14:53.198 --> 01:14:54.675
– Just concentrate on what you're doing.
– You sure?

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:56.339
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.049
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

01:14:58.119 --> 01:14:59.930
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.599
You're up and down
like a freaking yo-yo here!

01:15:01.623 --> 01:15:04.000
– Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
– Oh, this is my baby.

01:15:04.084 --> 01:15:06.836
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:09.422
Great.

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:12.133
Relax. We're almost there.

01:15:15.512 --> 01:15:18.932
There it is. The island. Three Mile Island.

01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.434
Hiding in plain sight.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:26.981
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:29.025
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

01:15:29.109 --> 01:15:31.194
– Like you? – Right.

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:36.658
All right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:38.159
About time.

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:50.922
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.800
Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:57.929
– Good luck. – Likewise.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:01.391
Oh, shit.

01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:11.359
How you doing? Everything all right?

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:15.405
– Is he ready yet?
– A few more hours.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:18.741
– And he will respond to my commands?
– Absolutely.

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:23.681
Logan.

01:17:24.933 --> 01:17:27.060
Welcome back to the war.

01:17:28.061 --> 01:17:30.897
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.943
I needed your powers for the Pool.

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:37.487
– For the what?
– The mutant killer.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.031
Deadpool.

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:43.201
Years of searching and refining,

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:47.247
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.499
without ripping it apart.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:53.419
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:57.423
Logan, you were the last.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.759
You made Weapon XI possible.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:06.015
I asked you to help,
but you said you wanted the quiet life.

01:18:08.101 --> 01:18:09.310
Well,

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:14.899
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.918
Who are you?

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.963
Oh, she's real, old friend.

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:52.103
Did you really think
we'd just let you walk away?

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:54.439
You're a dangerous man.

01:18:54.522 --> 01:18:57.317
We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

01:18:58.026 --> 01:19:00.445
Tell him about the day you died.

01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:09.412
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:15.168
It reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatlined.

01:19:27.055 --> 01:19:29.098
Don't be angry with her.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.852
She's a real credit to your species.

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:39.609
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:43.112
Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis.

01:19:43.738 --> 01:19:46.783
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:49.494
Quite a useful tool in a seduction.

01:19:49.577 --> 01:19:51.913
It was never real, my friend.

01:19:57.335 --> 01:19:59.212
It was real for me.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:05.718
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you found.

01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:16.729
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:20.650
I had it backwards.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:27.323
I thought you were the moon
and I was your wolverine.

01:20:29.617 --> 01:20:32.328
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:35.415
I'm just the fool who got played.

01:20:37.417 --> 01:20:40.420
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:45.758
But I ignored my instincts.

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:51.639
I ignored what I really am.

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:58.771
But that won't ever happen again.

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:32.388
– Colonel? – Not now, Kayla.

01:21:32.472 --> 01:21:34.974
I've done everything you've asked.

01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:37.894
My sister.

01:21:38.853 --> 01:21:41.898
You said if I helped you, you'd let her go.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:46.569
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful.

01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:48.933
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:50.615
You let him go?

01:21:54.077 --> 01:21:56.412
– Victor, please.
– You can't let him go.

01:21:56.496 --> 01:21:58.557
– You can't beat him, Victor.
– Then give me the Adamantium!

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.017
– Your tests came back.
– We had a deal!

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:02.710
You would never survive the operation.

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:08.049
– I can take anything he can.
– No, you can't.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:12.804
You're my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time will come.

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:14.514
He's using us.

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:26.567
How about this time you die for real?

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:29.612
Let me go.

01:22:32.198 --> 01:22:34.784
Your little mind games don't work on me.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.202
Victor!

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.613
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:15.575
All that rage.

01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:20.079
– Do it. – Logan!

01:23:21.414 --> 01:23:25.084
– You're not an animal.
– Oh, yes, you are.

01:23:29.172 --> 01:23:30.590
Do it.

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:35.928
Finish it.

01:24:00.453 --> 01:24:01.787
Logan?

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:08.961
My sister. They have my sister.

01:24:09.462 --> 01:24:12.381
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me.

01:24:13.174 --> 01:24:15.301
It was real for me, too.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:21.349
Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

01:24:22.934 --> 01:24:24.393
Where is she?

01:24:29.857 --> 01:24:32.401
– Activate Weapon XI!
– The bonding process isn't complete.

01:24:32.485 --> 01:24:34.195
Just do it! Now!

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:39.051
Come on. Come on!

01:26:30.436 --> 01:26:31.562
Okay.

01:26:32.605 --> 01:26:33.856
Perfect.

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.779
– Kayla, get these kids out of here.
– Logan...

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:37.693
Find another way out.

01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:40.321
Okay. Let's go.

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:42.782
Wade, is that you?

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.955
Guess Stryker finally figured out
how to shut you up.

01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:53.292
Now...

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:01.801
Wade?

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.929
You don't have to do this.

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:07.807
All right, maybe you do.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.649
You're shitting me.

01:27:21.904 --> 01:27:23.697
Shoot on sight!

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.750
– I can help! Point me at them!
– Go.

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:44.260
Go! Now!

01:27:50.558 --> 01:27:53.060
– Did I get them? – Yeah.

01:28:03.237 --> 01:28:04.780
– Let's go. – I can't go.

01:28:04.864 --> 01:28:07.491
– Kayla, come on!
– I have to stay here.

01:28:07.992 --> 01:28:09.618
You take them.

01:28:10.578 --> 01:28:12.788
Go! Go!

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.067
Go <i>left.</i>

01:28:42.151 --> 01:28:43.360
Left.

01:28:44.195 --> 01:28:45.905
– What? – We go left.

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:48.073
– You can't see. – Trust me.

01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:05.090
Let's see you dance up here.

01:29:41.627 --> 01:29:43.671
Nobody kills you but me.

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:54.056
Back to back!

01:29:55.808 --> 01:29:58.269
– I got him!
– Oh, no, you don't.

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.824
Stop! This can't be the way.

01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:37.409
– This is the way.
– How do you know?

01:31:37.493 --> 01:31:39.328
I just know. Come on.

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:52.549
Adamantium bullets.

01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:56.345
Let's see him heal with
a few of these through his thick skull.

01:31:56.428 --> 01:31:58.972
You can't stop him, even with that.

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:01.767
– He'll heal.
– His brain may heal,

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.271
but his memories won't grow back.

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:26.125
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

01:32:27.418 --> 01:32:30.504
– We're done.
– We can never be done, Jimmy.

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:35.467
We're brothers,
and brothers look out for each other.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:11.503
– You miss me? – Ah, Jesus.

01:33:12.963 --> 01:33:15.340
You know, when you said
you were gonna kill everyone,

01:33:15.424 --> 01:33:17.926
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.428
Yeah.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:22.598
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

01:33:22.681 --> 01:33:24.683
– You're welcome. – Logan?

01:33:27.186 --> 01:33:28.479
Logan.

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:34.860
There's kids trying to get off the island.
Split up. Go!

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:36.361
I'm on it.

01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:46.413
Kayla! Kayla!

01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:51.668
Hey.

01:33:56.673 --> 01:33:58.133
I love you.

01:34:10.521 --> 01:34:12.189
– Hey... – I'm so cold.

01:34:12.272 --> 01:34:15.317
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.860
Understand?

01:34:16.944 --> 01:34:20.239
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

01:34:22.616 --> 01:34:25.160
Okay. I'm gonna get you help.

01:34:48.559 --> 01:34:49.977
Logan!

01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:48.910
I should make you pull the trigger.

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:52.623
But that would make us
no better than you.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.500
Throw the gun away.

01:35:58.754 --> 01:36:00.172
Turn around.

01:36:00.797 --> 01:36:05.427
Walk until your feet bleed.
And then keep walking.

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:45.300
<i>It will be all right, Scott.</i>

01:36:45.384 --> 01:36:48.136
<i>My name is Charles Xavier</i>

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.222
<i>I'm a mutant like you.</i>

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:54.518
<i>– I can hear your thoughts.
– Yes, and I can hear yours.</i>

01:36:55.352 --> 01:36:59.231
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

01:37:00.232 --> 01:37:02.150
Come on, let's go.

01:37:48.447 --> 01:37:50.115
The kids are safe.

01:37:55.454 --> 01:37:56.747
Damn.

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:03.170
– Who are you?
– What do you mean, who am I?

01:38:03.253 --> 01:38:06.590
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:09.134
Where the hell am I?

01:38:09.217 --> 01:38:11.428
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

01:38:11.845 --> 01:38:14.556
– I'm a friend.
– Yeah? What's my name?

01:38:14.639 --> 01:38:17.642
– What's my name?
– Your name is Logan.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.649
You need to trust me. We have to go.

01:38:30.072 --> 01:38:31.490
Follow me.

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:38.246
Now!

01:39:11.947 --> 01:39:13.573
Do you know her?

01:39:17.494 --> 01:39:18.829
No.

01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:25.686
Hey, these boys aren't gonna like
what you've done to this place.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.629
We really need to go.

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:30.173
I'll find my own way.

01:39:35.095 --> 01:39:36.555
Good luck.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:09.314
Colonel Stryker?

01:41:13.652 --> 01:41:17.280
– Colonel William Stryker?
– Yes.

01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:20.468
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

01:41:20.492 --> 01:41:22.994
of General Munson, sir.
