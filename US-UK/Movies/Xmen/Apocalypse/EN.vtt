"X-Men: Apocalypse " ^

00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:00.577
Mutants...

00:01:00.578 --> 00:01:04.148
born with extraordinary abilities...

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:08.810
and yet, still, they are children
stumbling in the dark...

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:11.084
searching for guidance.

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:15.630
A gift can often be a curse.

00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:21.094
Give someone wings,
and they may fly too close to the sun.

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.867
Give them the power of prophecy...

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:27.812
and they may live in fear
of the future.

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.565
Give them the greatest
gifts of all...

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.956
powers beyond imagination...

00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:38.377
and they may think they're meant
to rule the world.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:56.733
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:02:02.880
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:09.238
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.569
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:22.253
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.470
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.644
Sleep.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.575
Let the transference begin.

00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:12.088
Watch out!

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:16.435
Death to the false god.

00:05:25.785 --> 00:05:28.731
The pyramid!
The pyramid is collapsing!

00:05:28.756 --> 00:05:32.820
- Run.
- Run for you lives.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:38.321
Protect him!

00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:23.619
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered...

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.165
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:32.286
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:35.381
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President...

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:38.092
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

00:08:38.093 --> 00:08:42.221
Their lives were saved
by a young mutant who stopped him.

00:08:42.222 --> 00:08:45.570
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:48.185
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:51.522
But she has become the symbol
of a new age...

00:08:51.523 --> 00:08:54.108
the face of a world
that will never be the same again.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:55.747
You winking at my girl?

00:08:55.772 --> 00:08:57.120
Yes, the world is panicked.

00:08:57.145 --> 00:08:58.755
Your girl?

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.758
I guess you do look old enough
to be her father.

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:04.003
Excuse me, gentlemen...
is there something you'd

00:09:04.027 --> 00:09:05.775
like to share with the
rest of the class?

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.938
Can I please go to the bathroom?

00:09:07.973 --> 00:09:10.451
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:12.185
Fine, Scott.
And afterwards...

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.676
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.909
that you're disrupting class again?

00:09:17.549 --> 00:09:19.059
I trust you know the way.

00:09:19.084 --> 00:09:21.445
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.467
No, hang on!
Hang on!

00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:28.601
Hey!

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:30.181
Now, I know most of you were, what?

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:33.514
Around seven years old
at that time?

00:09:42.975 --> 00:09:44.997
Summers!

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:48.379
I know you're in here.

00:09:49.778 --> 00:09:51.499
What, are you crying?

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.869
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:58.456
Summers!
You want to eyeball my girl?

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:03.837
Summers.

00:10:06.754 --> 00:10:07.882
Summers!

00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:11.947
STOP!!!

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.262
Yeah!

00:10:46.263 --> 00:10:47.930
Ten fights waged.

00:10:47.931 --> 00:10:49.557
Ten fights won.

00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:51.809
The Winged Warrior.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.435
The Bird of Prey.

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:54.770
The Angel of Death.

00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:56.605
ANGEL!

00:10:56.606 --> 00:10:58.571
Yeah!

00:11:02.946 --> 00:11:06.532
Let's hear it for the fat man!

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:09.285
Our next challenger...

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:10.953
comes straight...

00:11:10.954 --> 00:11:14.725
from the Munich Circus.

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:16.768
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:19.546
the only one that could take on an Angel...

00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:22.199
is the Devil himself.

00:11:22.966 --> 00:11:25.261
I give you...

00:11:25.286 --> 00:11:27.308
the amazing...

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:29.653
the fantastic...

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:33.685
NIGHTCRAWLER!

00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:52.745
Caution

00:11:52.746 --> 00:11:54.455
High voltage!

00:11:54.456 --> 00:11:57.150
Sorry mutants!

00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:12.973
Hey.

00:12:12.974 --> 00:12:15.059
Did you get lost little mouse?

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.375
The fight is over there.

00:12:19.522 --> 00:12:20.606
Fight!

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:22.535
Or they'll kill us both!

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:27.370
And it's about to get exciting.

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:29.354
Ah, you mean this?

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:30.666
Yes?

00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.246
Nightcrawler!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.894
Nightcrawler!
Nightcrawler!

00:12:58.895 --> 00:12:59.895
I'm sorry.

00:12:59.896 --> 00:13:01.954
I'm sorry!

00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:43.563
They went that way!

00:13:49.002 --> 00:13:50.672
You can...

00:13:50.697 --> 00:13:52.072
transform.

00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:53.240
You're her.

00:13:53.241 --> 00:13:54.658
- The hero.
- I'm nobody.

00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:55.826
I'm not a hero.

00:13:55.827 --> 00:13:57.494
Let's get out of here.

00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:20.809
Have a good night, Henryk.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.011
You too, Milosz.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.342
Hi Honey.

00:14:53.343 --> 00:14:54.877
Hi.

00:14:58.473 --> 00:14:59.881
Good day?

00:14:59.906 --> 00:15:01.778
Better now.

00:15:01.893 --> 00:15:02.999
Where's Nina?

00:15:03.024 --> 00:15:05.977
Out back.
With her friends.

00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:10.767
Don't worry.

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:13.357
There is enough for everyone.

00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:21.189
Close your eyes now.

00:15:21.214 --> 00:15:25.103
Go to sleep

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:33.889
and have a sweet dream.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.048
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

00:15:37.929 --> 00:15:40.544
I learned it from my parents.

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.317
And they learned it from their parents.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.762
And them from theirs.

00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:48.590
And one day...

00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:51.659
you'll sing it to your children, too.

00:15:52.777 --> 00:15:54.236
What happened to them?

00:15:54.237 --> 00:15:56.154
Your parents.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.577
They were taken from me...

00:16:01.578 --> 00:16:03.780
when I was a little boy.

00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.660
But they're still here.

00:16:08.793 --> 00:16:10.665
Inside.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.460
And here.

00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:16.592
With you.

00:16:16.593 --> 00:16:20.467
Is someone going to take you away?

00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.292
Never.

00:16:39.115 --> 00:16:41.173
I guess we're more alike
than we thought.

00:16:41.198 --> 00:16:43.074
He won't listen to us.

00:16:43.099 --> 00:16:44.724
He's just...
He's being...

00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:46.541
Scott.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.028
Let me try.

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.567
Smells pretty old in here.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:08.277
Is this a school or a museum?

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:11.458
One more.
And last one.

00:17:11.483 --> 00:17:13.526
There you go.

00:17:13.694 --> 00:17:14.773
I'll see you guys.

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:15.978
Oh.

00:17:25.027 --> 00:17:26.445
Watch where you're going.

00:17:26.446 --> 00:17:28.147
I can't.

00:17:28.285 --> 00:17:29.906
What?
Who are you talking to?

00:17:29.907 --> 00:17:31.574
Me.

00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:34.921
I just heard you in my head.

00:17:34.946 --> 00:17:36.780
I'm telepathic.
I read minds.

00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:37.948
Well, stay out of mine.

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:40.844
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

00:17:40.869 --> 00:17:43.651
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:46.125
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.397
No, you didn't.

00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:50.874
Alex Summers?

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:52.527
Hank McCoy!

00:17:52.552 --> 00:17:55.299
Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you'?

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.964
I keep him under control now.

00:17:58.761 --> 00:18:00.179
This is my brother, Scott.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.461
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

00:18:05.678 --> 00:18:06.894
Where's the professor?

00:18:06.895 --> 00:18:10.856
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated...

00:18:10.857 --> 00:18:13.150
"and a new start made.

00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:14.818
"Let us now start fresh...

00:18:14.819 --> 00:18:16.904
"without remembrance...

00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:21.283
"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."

00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:24.569
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:26.671
when he wrote all that?

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:31.011
That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.

00:18:31.036 --> 00:18:34.236
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.

00:18:34.714 --> 00:18:35.672
Alex.

00:18:35.673 --> 00:18:37.707
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

00:18:37.732 --> 00:18:39.644
You look well.
It's been a while.

00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:41.373
It has.
Not too bad yourself.

00:18:41.398 --> 00:18:42.739
Thank you.

00:18:42.764 --> 00:18:45.158
This is my brother, Scott.

00:18:45.183 --> 00:18:48.389
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.

00:18:48.414 --> 00:18:51.497
Yeah.
It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

00:18:51.522 --> 00:18:54.224
It never does, at first.

00:18:56.319 --> 00:18:58.695
The first step in
understanding one's power...

00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:00.697
is learning the extent of it.

00:19:00.698 --> 00:19:03.951
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

00:19:03.952 --> 00:19:06.912
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...

00:19:06.913 --> 00:19:10.507
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...

00:19:10.532 --> 00:19:12.960
and play a stable and
productive part in it.

00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:14.336
Why don't you take your bandages off...

00:19:14.337 --> 00:19:17.047
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

00:19:17.048 --> 00:19:20.588
Alex, would you line him up? Face him
in the right direction, as it were.

00:19:20.613 --> 00:19:22.205
There's a target just
across the water.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.573
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

00:19:27.684 --> 00:19:29.726
You can open your eyes, Scott.

00:19:29.727 --> 00:19:32.600
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

00:19:38.152 --> 00:19:39.861
Look out!
Get back!

00:19:39.862 --> 00:19:42.054
Get back!
Get back!

00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:45.433
Whoa.

00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:50.232
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:53.830
I used to swing...
from the branches of it, myself.

00:19:56.906 --> 00:19:59.448
I think that was probably
my favorite tree.

00:20:00.351 --> 00:20:01.967
Does that mean I'm expelled?

00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:03.885
On the contrary.

00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:06.624
You're enrolled.

00:20:55.371 --> 00:20:57.080
Do you sell rugs?

00:20:57.081 --> 00:20:59.374
You're not allowed in this area.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:01.376
This rug is for sale?

00:21:01.377 --> 00:21:02.748
I said, this...

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.662
Good morning.
My lord, En Sabah Nur.

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:23.522
Oh, mighty lord.

00:22:23.547 --> 00:22:27.783
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

00:22:32.003 --> 00:22:35.898
The great, all mighty lord.

00:22:35.923 --> 00:22:39.569
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

00:22:39.594 --> 00:22:41.918
We are your loyal followers.

00:22:41.943 --> 00:22:44.309
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:48.385
The great, all mighty lord.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.303
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

00:22:52.328 --> 00:22:53.872
Look, quick.

00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:56.200
Everyone, look.

00:22:56.668 --> 00:22:58.863
En Sabah Nur.

00:22:58.888 --> 00:23:02.223
The great, all mighty lord.

00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:05.958
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

00:23:05.983 --> 00:23:08.180
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:23:08.205 --> 00:23:11.990
The great, all mighty lord.

00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:16.347
Grant us with your power.
Grant us with your authority.

00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:07.355
Lord!

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.326
What's happening?

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.527
En Sabah Nur.
En Sabah Nur.

00:24:25.574 --> 00:24:27.608
Something's wrong.
No. No.

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.625
- Run!
- Quick, run!

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.949
Earthquake!

00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:53.752
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

00:25:53.753 --> 00:25:55.011
She's doing it again.

00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:56.745
Back to bed, please, everyone.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.125
Jesse, back to bed, please.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.817
Come on now.
Spit-spot, back to bed.

00:25:59.842 --> 00:26:02.369
Carrie Anne, come on now.
Back to bed.

00:26:10.075 --> 00:26:11.741
Never seen it like this.

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:13.683
Nor I.

00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:16.665
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

00:26:36.454 --> 00:26:38.155
Jean.

00:26:59.358 --> 00:27:01.627
Jean!

00:27:02.802 --> 00:27:05.592
Jean!

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:15.671
I saw the end of the world.

00:27:15.718 --> 00:27:17.218
I could feel...

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:20.092
all this death.

00:27:21.682 --> 00:27:23.224
It was just a dream.

00:27:23.225 --> 00:27:25.060
No, it felt real.

00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:26.769
I know.

00:27:26.794 --> 00:27:30.023
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

00:27:30.024 --> 00:27:31.316
It can convince itself...

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:32.099
No, no...

00:27:32.124 --> 00:27:35.681
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

00:27:35.706 --> 00:27:37.908
it's something else.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:43.533
Some dark power inside
and it's growing.

00:27:43.558 --> 00:27:45.741
Like a fire.

00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:47.526
I thought I was getting better.

00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:48.944
You are.

00:27:48.969 --> 00:27:50.886
You will.

00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:52.120
You just have to be patient.

00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:55.783
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

00:27:55.808 --> 00:27:57.911
To be trapped inside
your own head.

00:27:57.936 --> 00:28:00.332
Oh, I think I do.

00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:04.767
It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.

00:28:04.925 --> 00:28:06.593
All their suffering.

00:28:06.594 --> 00:28:08.341
All their pain.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.796
Their secrets.

00:28:13.475 --> 00:28:16.979
I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.

00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:21.783
Lie back.

00:28:31.218 --> 00:28:35.468
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

00:28:36.849 --> 00:28:39.600
You will learn to control your powers.

00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:41.761
And when you do...

00:28:42.104 --> 00:28:44.647
you'll have nothing to fear.

00:28:46.223 --> 00:28:48.067
Her nightmares were different this time.

00:28:48.068 --> 00:28:50.883
Well, it could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

00:28:50.907 --> 00:28:53.511
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

00:28:53.536 --> 00:28:54.956
I picked it up
on one of my meters.

00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:56.711
You're saying that Jean created it?

00:28:56.736 --> 00:28:58.211
No. I'm saying something else did.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.602
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

00:29:00.627 --> 00:29:02.453
But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.

00:29:02.477 --> 00:29:04.014
- Halfway around the world?
- Yeah.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.783
That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.

00:29:05.807 --> 00:29:08.029
Let's see what we can find.

00:29:10.466 --> 00:29:12.780
Welcome, Professor.

00:29:22.728 --> 00:29:25.351
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

00:29:26.612 --> 00:29:28.709
I'll put in the coordinates.

00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:55.319
I gotta get out of here.

00:29:55.344 --> 00:29:57.359
Give them a report.

00:29:58.765 --> 00:30:00.264
What?
What is it?

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:04.242
Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.

00:30:05.124 --> 00:30:06.708
It's her.

00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:08.184
Who?

00:30:09.024 --> 00:30:10.483
- Moira.
- What?

00:30:10.484 --> 00:30:12.461
Moira MacTaggert?

00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:13.898
Give me the details.

00:30:13.923 --> 00:30:16.329
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

00:30:16.354 --> 00:30:18.397
No.
I meant...

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.242
What is she doing there?
What does the CIA want with this?

00:30:21.267 --> 00:30:25.182
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

00:30:25.207 --> 00:30:26.563
I'm going to go there...

00:30:26.588 --> 00:30:28.876
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

00:30:28.877 --> 00:30:30.628
And you want to go see Moira.

00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:32.505
I want to go check her out.
Check out...

00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:34.332
the situation.

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:39.282
Moira MacTaggert.

00:30:41.063 --> 00:30:43.481
It's like a ghost from the past.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.728
You did a good thing.
You saved that man.

00:30:47.729 --> 00:30:49.601
That's not the point.

00:30:49.626 --> 00:30:51.496
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.222
We have to go.

00:30:53.313 --> 00:30:55.337
This is our home.

00:30:55.362 --> 00:30:57.238
This is our daughter's home.

00:30:57.239 --> 00:30:59.862
We are her home.

00:31:00.719 --> 00:31:04.245
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

00:31:04.246 --> 00:31:06.080
I trusted you then.

00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:08.783
I need you to trust me now.

00:31:09.168 --> 00:31:11.862
We can't stay here anymore.

00:31:16.258 --> 00:31:18.082
I'll get Nina.

00:31:20.095 --> 00:31:22.047
Sweetheart.

00:31:32.274 --> 00:31:33.923
She's not in her room.

00:31:33.948 --> 00:31:36.004
And I don't see her out back.

00:31:43.577 --> 00:31:44.785
Nina?

00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:46.287
Nina!

00:31:46.288 --> 00:31:47.371
Nina!

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:48.914
Nina!

00:31:54.087 --> 00:31:56.164
Nina!

00:32:16.662 --> 00:32:17.902
Nina.

00:32:17.903 --> 00:32:19.779
Are you alright?

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.113
She's fine.

00:32:21.114 --> 00:32:22.218
Then let her go!

00:32:22.243 --> 00:32:24.091
We will.

00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:26.963
We just wanted to have a word

00:32:29.414 --> 00:32:32.124
You're not wearing your badges.

00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:34.192
No metal.

00:32:34.962 --> 00:32:37.880
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:40.341
Something that didn't add up.

00:32:40.342 --> 00:32:42.009
Put your weapons away.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.679
You've been a good citizen, Henryk...

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.181
A good neighbor...
a good worker.

00:32:47.182 --> 00:32:49.016
I want to believe
that's who you are.

00:32:49.017 --> 00:32:50.184
It is.

00:32:50.185 --> 00:32:52.830
But nobody in this town
really knows you.

00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:54.926
Yes you do.

00:32:55.357 --> 00:32:57.441
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.989
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

00:33:00.014 --> 00:33:02.238
And you were lying
the whole time.

00:33:02.239 --> 00:33:04.948
I brought a killer
into my house.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.461
Is this you?

00:33:12.916 --> 00:33:15.809
Are you the one
they call Magneto?

00:33:36.106 --> 00:33:38.774
Take me in.

00:33:38.775 --> 00:33:39.650
Please...

00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:42.215
Just let my daughter go.

00:33:52.164 --> 00:33:54.199
Go with your mother.

00:34:02.007 --> 00:34:04.070
Please...!

00:34:04.384 --> 00:34:06.719
Don't leave me.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.023
I'm not going to
let them take you.

00:34:09.048 --> 00:34:11.719
Nina. Nina, please.
Please.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.733
Nina.

00:34:14.758 --> 00:34:16.024
Nina.
Nina

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:16.906
Please.

00:34:16.931 --> 00:34:18.272
What's going on?

00:34:18.273 --> 00:34:20.130
She's one of them?

00:34:20.155 --> 00:34:21.626
Please.

00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:22.693
Tell her to stop!

00:34:22.694 --> 00:34:24.113
She can't control it!

00:34:24.138 --> 00:34:25.649
- Nina.
- Please.

00:34:25.674 --> 00:34:27.329
She's scared of you!

00:34:27.354 --> 00:34:32.181
I'm not going to let them take you!
I'm not going to let them take you!

00:34:36.249 --> 00:34:38.213
Make her stop!

00:34:39.148 --> 00:34:41.475
Nina!
Nina!

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.962
Please stop.

00:34:44.164 --> 00:34:46.371
Please stop, Nina!

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:03.484
Nina.

00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:05.425
Nina, Nina, no...

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.809
No, please.
Please! Please.

00:35:07.834 --> 00:35:10.402
- What have you done?
- Please don't leave me.

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:12.276
Please.

00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:15.317
Please.
Please.

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:24.004
Not my babies.

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:31.091
Not my babies.

00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:15.691
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME?

00:36:17.767 --> 00:36:19.935
Is this what I am?

00:36:26.818 --> 00:36:29.065
Is this what I am?

00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:36.066
God damn thief.
Stop that thief.

00:37:38.405 --> 00:37:41.830
Stop her.
Stop that thief!

00:37:44.147 --> 00:37:46.772
You know what we do to thieves.

00:37:46.773 --> 00:37:48.190
Pick a hand.

00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:50.017
Enough.

00:37:52.183 --> 00:37:54.435
If you're with her, I
suggest you walk away.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.754
While you still can.

00:37:58.493 --> 00:38:00.160
Walk away.

00:38:00.823 --> 00:38:05.392
Who rules this world?

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:07.555
What language is that?

00:38:09.664 --> 00:38:12.325
Clown-face.
What's the deal?

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.176
Beat it!

00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:30.936
I'm sorry.

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:33.278
I'm sorry.

00:38:36.443 --> 00:38:40.397
You can't feel it, can you?

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:55.625
Now you feel it.

00:39:04.127 --> 00:39:06.352
So you really haven't seen her
in all these years'?

00:39:06.353 --> 00:39:09.155
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.035
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.861
Yes, I looked her up once.
Twice.

00:39:13.886 --> 00:39:15.637
But not in a long time, all right?

00:39:15.662 --> 00:39:18.590
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

00:39:18.615 --> 00:39:19.653
Not likely.

00:39:19.678 --> 00:39:21.971
Everybody take a break.

00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:25.829
I wiped her mind
of all memories of us.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.842
The beach, Cuba...
that whole time.

00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:30.992
It was so long ago, Alex.

00:39:31.017 --> 00:39:32.585
Before the world knew about mutants.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.378
I felt it was the
best thing for her.

00:39:36.403 --> 00:39:38.395
And for you?

00:39:40.387 --> 00:39:43.214
Didn't really matter
what was best for me.

00:39:46.462 --> 00:39:48.060
Moira...

00:39:48.061 --> 00:39:50.565
MacTaggert, hello!

00:39:52.838 --> 00:39:54.584
Oh, Jeez.
What the devil?

00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:56.110
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:58.070
- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.

00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:00.447
- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?

00:40:00.448 --> 00:40:02.116
Of course I do.

00:40:02.117 --> 00:40:04.565
I have read all of your papers.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.454
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

00:40:07.686 --> 00:40:08.865
Moira MacTaggert.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:10.416
- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.

00:40:10.417 --> 00:40:13.030
Just throw that on the floor.

00:40:13.461 --> 00:40:14.838
It's wonderful to see you again.

00:40:14.863 --> 00:40:17.631
To meet you again,
for the first time.

00:40:17.632 --> 00:40:19.632
You've got a son?

00:40:20.482 --> 00:40:21.516
Yes.

00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:23.865
Does he have a husband?

00:40:25.174 --> 00:40:27.266
Do you have a husband?

00:40:27.267 --> 00:40:28.720
I had a husband...

00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:31.682
but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.

00:40:31.707 --> 00:40:32.707
Good, good.

00:40:32.732 --> 00:40:34.958
We all make choices, right?

00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:37.606
Yes, we do.

00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:41.841
- Professor.
- Yes?

00:40:42.124 --> 00:40:43.244
Yes.

00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:45.823
I was, we were hoping that you would...

00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:48.805
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.624
I'm afraid that's classified information.

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:54.457
And, I don't mean to be rude, but...

00:40:54.713 --> 00:40:56.837
how did you get in here?

00:40:56.862 --> 00:40:59.314
I have level-five clearance.

00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:03.711
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

00:41:03.736 --> 00:41:06.382
there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...

00:41:06.407 --> 00:41:08.919
Second Coming or sign of God.

00:41:08.944 --> 00:41:11.347
I was tracking one of them.

00:41:11.352 --> 00:41:14.408
They call themselves,
Ashir En Sabah Nur...

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:18.081
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

00:41:18.106 --> 00:41:19.565
The world's first what?

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.504
The world's first mutant.

00:41:21.529 --> 00:41:23.756
I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.

00:41:23.781 --> 00:41:26.401
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

00:41:26.426 --> 00:41:29.928
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

00:41:29.953 --> 00:41:32.201
And they believe he will rise again.

00:41:32.226 --> 00:41:36.352
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

00:41:36.377 --> 00:41:41.600
These hieroglyphs... describe a specific set
of powers greater than any man could possess.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:43.509
They think he lived
all that time?

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.763
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

00:41:45.788 --> 00:41:48.250
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

00:41:48.275 --> 00:41:49.723
And whenever he was
close to death...

00:41:49.724 --> 00:41:51.547
he would just take
on a new body.

00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.477
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:55.052
enabling him to take their powers...

00:41:55.077 --> 00:41:57.519
amassing various abilities
over the years.

00:41:57.544 --> 00:42:00.380
- An all-powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

00:42:00.405 --> 00:42:03.266
And wherever this being was
he always had four...

00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:05.932
principle followers.
Disciples.

00:42:05.957 --> 00:42:08.202
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

00:42:08.227 --> 00:42:11.912
Like the Four Horsemen...
of the Apocalypse.

00:42:11.913 --> 00:42:13.169
He got that one from the Bible.

00:42:13.194 --> 00:42:15.612
Or the Bible got it from him.

00:42:15.637 --> 00:42:17.618
And wherever he ruled...

00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:20.897
eventually, it would end in disaster.

00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:22.381
Cataclysm.

00:42:22.382 --> 00:42:24.591
Some kind of...

00:42:24.592 --> 00:42:26.760
Apocalypse

00:42:27.095 --> 00:42:29.547
The end of the world.

00:42:30.415 --> 00:42:32.992
I must say, Apollo...

00:42:33.301 --> 00:42:36.053
the way you ape human behavior
is remarkable.

00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:37.616
Get out, children.

00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:39.012
Get out.
Get out.

00:42:39.037 --> 00:42:41.898
Come on.
Come on.

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:43.569
I am Apollo.

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.864
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

00:42:46.865 --> 00:42:48.490
You speak Egyptian?

00:42:48.491 --> 00:42:49.908
Arabic?

00:42:49.951 --> 00:42:51.243
English?

00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:52.953
I'm a scientist.

00:42:52.954 --> 00:42:54.734
My particular specialty...

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.460
Great fighter.

00:42:57.642 --> 00:42:58.976
She's my hero.

00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:01.578
I want to be like her.

00:43:03.298 --> 00:43:06.161
There's some food here.
Not much.

00:43:06.186 --> 00:43:07.530
I don't believe it.

00:43:07.555 --> 00:43:09.459
You love me.

00:43:09.751 --> 00:43:11.452
Love you?

00:43:11.579 --> 00:43:13.297
Illogical.

00:43:13.322 --> 00:43:17.108
I'm not some simple
shepherdess you can awe.

00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:19.435
Why, I could no more love you...

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:24.006
than I could love a new species
of bacteria.

00:43:24.611 --> 00:43:26.779
What are you doing?

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.783
Learning.

00:43:37.795 --> 00:43:41.895
In the streets, there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.086
in a brotherhood of our kind.

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.709
Several demonstrations.

00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:48.641
One of them was held in Boston,
and Bruce Morton has the story.

00:43:48.666 --> 00:43:53.239
Since the advent of nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights.

00:43:53.264 --> 00:43:54.494
Weapons.

00:43:54.519 --> 00:43:57.438
Never before has man
possessed so much power.

00:43:57.463 --> 00:44:00.586
Soviet Union and United States
being superpowers...

00:44:01.773 --> 00:44:05.317
Superpowers.

00:44:05.616 --> 00:44:07.242
The weak...

00:44:07.267 --> 00:44:10.102
have taken the earth.

00:44:10.198 --> 00:44:13.655
For this, I was betrayed.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.564
False gods.

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:18.520
Idols.

00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:22.470
No more.

00:44:25.213 --> 00:44:29.918
I have returned.

00:44:29.926 --> 00:44:32.177
A new tomorrow...

00:44:32.178 --> 00:44:34.574
that starts today.

00:44:38.663 --> 00:44:41.081
Where did you come from?

00:44:47.169 --> 00:44:51.123
A time before man lost his way.

00:44:51.812 --> 00:44:53.156
Well.

00:44:53.658 --> 00:44:55.784
Welcome to the '80s.

00:44:55.785 --> 00:44:59.284
This world needs to be...

00:45:00.193 --> 00:45:02.645
Cleansed.

00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:04.459
What?

00:45:04.711 --> 00:45:06.913
Saved.

00:45:08.211 --> 00:45:10.400
You can't save the world...

00:45:10.425 --> 00:45:12.551
just going around killing people.

00:45:12.552 --> 00:45:14.386
There's laws, systems in place

00:45:14.387 --> 00:45:16.283
for that kind of thing.

00:45:18.433 --> 00:45:19.808
My child...

00:45:19.809 --> 00:45:23.137
why do you enslave yourself?

00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:28.191
What are you doing?

00:45:28.216 --> 00:45:31.312
Making you stronger.

00:45:31.714 --> 00:45:34.337
My goddess.

00:45:40.775 --> 00:45:42.522
Aphrodite.

00:45:42.847 --> 00:45:44.034
You were right.

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:46.355
Yes.

00:45:49.088 --> 00:45:51.214
You were right.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:53.792
The time is past.

00:45:53.968 --> 00:45:56.680
There is no room for gods.

00:46:00.683 --> 00:46:02.060
Why can't I go with you?

00:46:02.085 --> 00:46:04.412
I told you, I work alone.

00:46:10.974 --> 00:46:12.971
Wait there.

00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:15.989
Always good to see your face.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.839
Even if it's not yours.

00:46:17.864 --> 00:46:20.061
Papers and passage for one.

00:46:21.788 --> 00:46:24.289
Where's the gentleman going,
if I may ask?

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.194
Don't know, don't care.

00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:28.728
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:31.058
Mystique, the mercenary.

00:46:31.083 --> 00:46:32.121
Don't call me that.

00:46:32.146 --> 00:46:34.044
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

00:46:34.068 --> 00:46:35.693
Caliban knows who you are.

00:46:35.718 --> 00:46:38.204
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants...

00:46:38.229 --> 00:46:40.305
Caliban knows it.

00:46:40.306 --> 00:46:42.053
Mystique.

00:46:42.058 --> 00:46:43.225
Why don't you ask your psychics...

00:46:43.226 --> 00:46:45.352
what'll happen to you
if you keep pushing me?

00:46:45.353 --> 00:46:47.145
What'll happen?

00:46:50.508 --> 00:46:53.006
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

00:46:54.302 --> 00:46:56.029
But Caliban likes you.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.447
Caliban likes money.

00:46:57.448 --> 00:46:59.491
Caliban likes you so much...

00:46:59.492 --> 00:47:01.631
he wants to give you free information...

00:47:01.656 --> 00:47:03.915
about an old friend...

00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:05.956
from back when you had friends.

00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:08.583
Do you remember...

00:47:08.584 --> 00:47:10.919
Erik Lehnsherr?

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.895
My girls got a flash
of him in Poland.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.213
He left quite a few dead bodies
in his wake...

00:47:15.238 --> 00:47:18.359
including his wife and daughter.

00:47:18.384 --> 00:47:20.416
Should be in the news
soon enough...

00:47:20.441 --> 00:47:24.145
but Caliban gives you
a little head start.

00:47:25.268 --> 00:47:27.277
- How fast are you?
- How fast?

00:47:27.302 --> 00:47:28.661
How far can you cover?

00:47:28.686 --> 00:47:31.197
As far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

00:47:31.222 --> 00:47:33.697
- Come with me, Crawler.
- Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

00:47:33.722 --> 00:47:36.503
And my real name is...

00:47:37.363 --> 00:47:39.411
Kurt Wagner.

00:47:43.209 --> 00:47:45.806
The lenses are made of
some ruby quartz I had lying around.

00:47:45.831 --> 00:47:47.522
They should be able to
refract your optic beams...

00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:50.184
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

00:47:50.209 --> 00:47:51.915
Try them on.

00:48:06.058 --> 00:48:06.933
Okay-

00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:08.722
Go ahead.

00:48:09.272 --> 00:48:11.938
Wait.
Wait, sorry, no.

00:48:11.939 --> 00:48:12.981
Okay-

00:48:12.982 --> 00:48:14.065
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

00:48:14.066 --> 00:48:15.550
All right.

00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:20.715
Whoa.

00:48:21.616 --> 00:48:23.325
I can see.

00:48:23.326 --> 00:48:24.823
Thank you.

00:48:24.848 --> 00:48:26.712
Professor, thank you.
You're a genius.

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.154
No.

00:48:28.179 --> 00:48:31.302
I'm not a professor.
I wish...

00:48:32.939 --> 00:48:34.640
Who's that?

00:48:36.464 --> 00:48:38.073
I believe you two met.
That's Jean Grey.

00:48:38.098 --> 00:48:39.692
You bumped into her
when you arrived.

00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:42.340
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

00:48:47.206 --> 00:48:48.748
Hey.

00:48:50.937 --> 00:48:52.763
You can see.

00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:55.734
Yeah.
It's not as bad as I thought here.

00:48:55.759 --> 00:48:56.884
Freak.

00:48:56.909 --> 00:48:58.411
- Someone should warn the new kid.
- Yeah. Someone should tell him.

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.235
They're still scared of me.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.322
Hey, I have special glasses now.

00:49:02.323 --> 00:49:05.300
They're not scared of you.
They're scared of me.

00:49:05.935 --> 00:49:09.980
You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:11.581
Wait, so...

00:49:11.582 --> 00:49:14.669
last night, when the house shook...

00:49:14.694 --> 00:49:15.835
that was you?

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.162
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.146
Well, that's a first.

00:49:35.189 --> 00:49:36.978
Raven.

00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:42.813
Wow.

00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:45.080
I...
You're...

00:49:45.105 --> 00:49:46.512
Not blue?

00:49:46.537 --> 00:49:48.659
Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.

00:49:48.684 --> 00:49:51.478
No, no, I meant...
you...

00:49:52.688 --> 00:49:54.605
you're back.

00:49:55.493 --> 00:49:57.767
Never thought I'd see you here again.

00:49:58.779 --> 00:50:00.901
Yeah, me neither.

00:50:03.534 --> 00:50:05.368
I'm blue.

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.703
I'm Kurt.

00:50:06.704 --> 00:50:08.288
Oh, right.

00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:10.064
Kurt Wagner.

00:50:10.376 --> 00:50:11.918
Welcome.

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:16.778
We're closed.

00:50:19.592 --> 00:50:22.294
I knew I felt
a chill in the air.

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.703
How did you get in here?

00:50:25.728 --> 00:50:26.973
We let ourselves in.

00:50:26.974 --> 00:50:28.642
We are looking for mutants.

00:50:28.643 --> 00:50:31.895
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

00:50:31.896 --> 00:50:34.037
Caliban doesn't know you.

00:50:34.607 --> 00:50:38.219
We're looking for the strongest.

00:50:41.522 --> 00:50:42.814
Everything all right?

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.926
I'm fine, Psylocke.

00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:47.261
How much money do you have?

00:50:47.286 --> 00:50:48.828
None.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.393
Like Caliban said...

00:50:51.418 --> 00:50:53.791
we are closed.
Yeah?

00:50:54.621 --> 00:50:57.699
I need your help, my child.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.503
You don't look like
Caliban's father.

00:51:00.508 --> 00:51:03.079
Maybe a little bit up here.

00:51:10.073 --> 00:51:12.310
You are all my children...

00:51:12.311 --> 00:51:16.356
and you're lost, because
you follow blind leaders.

00:51:16.381 --> 00:51:19.192
These false gods...

00:51:19.193 --> 00:51:22.153
systems of the weak.

00:51:22.154 --> 00:51:24.965
They've ruined my world...

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:26.854
No more.

00:51:34.604 --> 00:51:37.147
What do you want?

00:51:46.157 --> 00:51:48.376
I want you...

00:51:48.401 --> 00:51:52.962
to feel the full reach
of your power.

00:51:57.017 --> 00:52:00.311
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

00:52:00.336 --> 00:52:01.877
Unlike others...

00:52:01.902 --> 00:52:04.738
who seek to control you...

00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:07.783
I want to set you free.

00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.920
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

00:52:21.422 --> 00:52:23.954
And I know where to find them.

00:52:27.338 --> 00:52:29.006
It's my first time in America.

00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:31.120
I'm very excited
to see your culture.

00:52:31.145 --> 00:52:33.034
Well, you're not gonna
see it here.

00:52:33.059 --> 00:52:36.394
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

00:52:36.395 --> 00:52:38.164
This is Scott.

00:52:38.189 --> 00:52:39.964
He's new here, too.

00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:42.511
And I'm already up
for a prison break.

00:52:43.944 --> 00:52:46.529
What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.948
I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.

00:52:48.949 --> 00:52:50.821
What's a mall?

00:52:51.285 --> 00:52:52.452
What's a mall?

00:52:52.453 --> 00:52:55.455
All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.

00:52:55.456 --> 00:52:57.011
Scott.

00:52:57.036 --> 00:52:59.935
What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.707
and the Professor's not even home.

00:53:02.732 --> 00:53:05.340
I'd like to go to the mall.

00:53:06.757 --> 00:53:07.943
Try it.

00:53:07.968 --> 00:53:09.396
All right.

00:53:09.421 --> 00:53:11.404
Where does he keep his cars?

00:53:24.273 --> 00:53:26.087
Faire pisse.

00:53:26.112 --> 00:53:28.723
Or should I say "piss off"?

00:53:33.494 --> 00:53:34.911
This is the guy?

00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:36.496
He used to be.

00:53:36.497 --> 00:53:38.846
I didn't know his wings were...

00:53:42.586 --> 00:53:44.129
Let's get out of here.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.279
His fighting days are done.

00:53:46.304 --> 00:53:48.446
No, they're not.

00:53:53.639 --> 00:53:55.830
What the hell is this?

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:00.019
I want to give you something.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.128
There's nothing you can give me
that I want.

00:54:03.153 --> 00:54:05.567
Yes, there is.

00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:22.889
Yes, my son.

00:54:35.891 --> 00:54:38.339
Yes.

00:54:48.736 --> 00:54:52.440
Rise, my angel.

00:54:54.575 --> 00:54:56.702
Rise.

00:55:26.085 --> 00:55:27.845
Wow.

00:55:28.947 --> 00:55:32.375
Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.290
That's impressive.

00:55:34.315 --> 00:55:37.359
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:39.170
Well, that's okay.

00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:41.935
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

00:55:42.915 --> 00:55:45.709
Hank, you're building
a warplane down here.

00:55:45.734 --> 00:55:48.487
After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.898
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

00:55:50.923 --> 00:55:52.340
But...

00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:54.801
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

00:55:54.802 --> 00:55:56.405
And he thinks the best of people.

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:57.824
He has hope.

00:55:57.849 --> 00:55:59.561
And you?

00:56:00.310 --> 00:56:02.600
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

00:56:02.601 --> 00:56:05.612
And prepare for the worst.

00:56:05.637 --> 00:56:07.884
I think the world
needs the X-Men.

00:56:08.691 --> 00:56:12.443
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

00:56:12.444 --> 00:56:15.407
- We could start it together.
- Hank, I'm here about Erik.

00:56:16.224 --> 00:56:18.017
Right. Erik.

00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.994
Yeah. Of course.

00:56:20.019 --> 00:56:21.019
Of course.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:23.326
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

00:56:23.372 --> 00:56:25.369
Real trouble.

00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:28.399
Isn't he always?

00:57:02.332 --> 00:57:04.537
Some of you spoke to the police...

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:08.830
about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.

00:57:10.734 --> 00:57:13.107
You want to know my powers...

00:57:14.099 --> 00:57:16.301
know who I am...

00:57:17.446 --> 00:57:19.817
see what I can do?

00:57:21.597 --> 00:57:23.579
I'll show you.

00:57:25.564 --> 00:57:29.234
Think of the person you love most
in your life.

00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:32.893
Your wife.

00:57:35.157 --> 00:57:37.109
Mother.

00:57:39.494 --> 00:57:41.662
Daughter.

00:57:45.433 --> 00:57:49.703
Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.600
And live with that pain.

00:57:53.888 --> 00:57:54.971
Forever.

00:57:54.996 --> 00:57:56.794
Henryk, please.

00:57:56.819 --> 00:57:58.745
Don't do this.

00:57:59.218 --> 00:58:01.636
My name isn't Henryk.

00:58:05.015 --> 00:58:07.502
My name is Magneto.

00:58:28.122 --> 00:58:30.242
Who the fuck are you?

00:58:32.519 --> 00:58:34.857
Stay back.

00:58:36.189 --> 00:58:38.151
Whoever you are...

00:58:38.176 --> 00:58:41.711
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

00:58:59.737 --> 00:59:02.189
I'm not here for them.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:05.737
I'm here for you.

00:59:22.301 --> 00:59:24.537
Come and see.

00:59:57.252 --> 01:00:00.580
This is where your power was born.

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:05.547
And this is where
your people were slaughtered.

01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:23.270
You shouldn't have brought me here.

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.814
Why?

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.125
Are you afraid to be here?

01:00:32.204 --> 01:00:35.703
You can't escape it, Erik.

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.824
Who are you?

01:00:38.849 --> 01:00:42.272
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

01:00:42.297 --> 01:00:46.877
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:50.221
I am born of death.

01:00:50.222 --> 01:00:54.871
I was there to spark... and fan
the flame of man's awakening.

01:00:54.896 --> 01:00:57.481
To spin the wheel of civilization.

01:00:57.506 --> 01:00:59.256
And when the forest would grow rank...

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:02.154
and needed clearing for new growth...

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:06.636
I was there to set it ablaze.

01:01:07.281 --> 01:01:08.948
Where were you...

01:01:08.949 --> 01:01:11.748
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

01:01:11.773 --> 01:01:13.160
Asleep.

01:01:13.161 --> 01:01:15.788
Trapped in darkness.

01:01:15.813 --> 01:01:17.939
I was not there for you, my son.

01:01:17.964 --> 01:01:20.409
But I am here now.

01:01:20.434 --> 01:01:24.246
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:29.758
Reach down.

01:01:29.783 --> 01:01:33.244
Feel the metal...
in the ground.

01:01:33.269 --> 01:01:36.727
Reach as deep as you can.

01:01:38.979 --> 01:01:41.397
You'll find you have the power...

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:44.977
to move the very Earth itself.

01:02:17.207 --> 01:02:23.000
Everything they've built will fall!

01:02:23.414 --> 01:02:26.788
And from the ashes of their world...

01:02:27.512 --> 01:02:31.130
we'll build a better one!

01:02:57.683 --> 01:03:02.103
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

01:03:02.104 --> 01:03:06.190
Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.

01:03:06.191 --> 01:03:09.610
As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...

01:03:09.611 --> 01:03:11.112
before he can strike again.

01:03:11.113 --> 01:03:14.100
If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:16.389
or as he is also known, Magneto...

01:03:16.414 --> 01:03:19.137
contact your local authorities
immediately...

01:03:19.162 --> 01:03:21.247
and proceed with caution...

01:03:21.248 --> 01:03:24.511
- as he is considered extremely...
- Peter.

01:03:24.536 --> 01:03:26.127
What's up?

01:03:28.839 --> 01:03:30.172
Just checking on you.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.466
I'm good.
Playing Pac-Man.

01:03:37.806 --> 01:03:39.265
You sure you weren't watching this?

01:03:39.266 --> 01:03:41.308
This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...

01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:43.561
between mutants and mankind.

01:03:43.562 --> 01:03:46.014
You're going after him, aren't you?

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:49.818
You wanted me to get
out of the house more, right?

01:03:49.943 --> 01:03:52.937
I can't stop you.
Nobody can.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:55.664
But trust me, this won't end well.

01:03:56.021 --> 01:03:58.314
Nothing does with him.

01:04:01.413 --> 01:04:03.164
I'm not afraid of him.

01:04:03.165 --> 01:04:05.343
You should be.

01:04:31.026 --> 01:04:33.820
I've read so much about this place.

01:04:34.529 --> 01:04:37.490
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

01:04:37.736 --> 01:04:39.241
familiar.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.409
Strange.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.702
Quite.

01:04:41.703 --> 01:04:43.567
Shall we?

01:04:44.535 --> 01:04:46.707
I'm just saying,
Empire is still the best.

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:49.418
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.920
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.588
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:54.256
you wouldn't have any of
the rest of the movies.

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:57.983
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

01:04:58.553 --> 01:05:00.346
Hank.
Are you in here?

01:05:00.347 --> 01:05:02.640
I'd like you to meet...

01:05:03.975 --> 01:05:05.267
Moira.

01:05:05.268 --> 01:05:06.977
Raven.

01:05:06.978 --> 01:05:09.203
I'm sorry, have we met?

01:05:10.565 --> 01:05:13.228
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...

01:05:13.253 --> 01:05:15.548
would you give us just one moment,
please?

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.803
Of course.

01:05:20.992 --> 01:05:23.619
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.597
Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:29.996
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

01:05:30.021 --> 01:05:32.165
Lucky girl.

01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:36.768
It's good to see you, Raven.

01:05:36.793 --> 01:05:39.621
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.340
It was once.

01:05:41.365 --> 01:05:44.181
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

01:05:44.182 --> 01:05:46.142
And I barely even recognize it now.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.641
You know, I have plans for this place.

01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:51.063
I mean to turn it
into a real campus.

01:05:51.064 --> 01:05:52.314
A university.

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:56.044
Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.

01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:58.304
Living and working...

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.748
growing together.

01:06:00.866 --> 01:06:02.877
You know, I really believed that once.

01:06:02.902 --> 01:06:06.054
I really believed we could
change them after DC.

01:06:06.079 --> 01:06:07.246
We did.

01:06:07.247 --> 01:06:09.373
No, Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

01:06:09.374 --> 01:06:11.792
It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.

01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:13.210
I got sick of living that lie.

01:06:13.211 --> 01:06:16.422
That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.

01:06:16.423 --> 01:06:19.971
I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.

01:06:20.218 --> 01:06:22.521
Things are better.
The world is better.

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.793
Maybe in Westchester.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.467
Out there, mutants are still running...

01:06:27.475 --> 01:06:29.336
hiding, living in fear.

01:06:29.361 --> 01:06:32.726
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

01:06:32.731 --> 01:06:34.565
You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.

01:06:34.566 --> 01:06:35.965
Teach them to fight.

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.176
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.465
You still sound just like him.

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:43.002
You sound just like Erik.

01:06:44.659 --> 01:06:46.827
That's why I'm here.

01:06:46.953 --> 01:06:49.121
He's resurfaced.

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.042
He had a wife and a child.

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:54.960
They were killed.

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:57.793
Along with a handful of policemen.

01:06:59.674 --> 01:07:02.106
The whole world will be
looking for him.

01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:05.166
But you can help me find him
before they do.

01:07:13.623 --> 01:07:16.666
Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.

01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:19.602
I don't even know what this is.

01:07:19.627 --> 01:07:21.504
It's Cerebro.

01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:22.696
The new model.

01:07:22.697 --> 01:07:25.145
I based the color on...

01:07:26.995 --> 01:07:28.696
It doesn't matter.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.304
What are those?

01:07:47.305 --> 01:07:50.178
Those are all the humans
of the world.

01:07:51.775 --> 01:07:54.061
And these...

01:07:54.062 --> 01:07:56.355
are all the mutants.

01:07:56.356 --> 01:07:59.381
I'm connected to
all of their minds.

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.986
The CIA would kill for this.

01:08:01.987 --> 01:08:04.314
I know they would.

01:08:06.241 --> 01:08:08.470
Where are you, Erik?

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:41.980
Charles?

01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:44.751
Hello, old friend.

01:08:47.221 --> 01:08:49.300
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry!

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:51.698
I feel your pain.

01:08:52.454 --> 01:08:54.747
And your loss.

01:08:55.415 --> 01:08:58.743
You think because you can
see into my head...

01:08:58.793 --> 01:09:01.495
you know how it feels?

01:09:01.629 --> 01:09:04.214
You're looking in the wrong place,
Charles.

01:09:04.215 --> 01:09:07.464
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.095
But come back to us.

01:09:10.096 --> 01:09:12.343
I can help you.

01:09:12.474 --> 01:09:14.693
Help me?

01:09:15.126 --> 01:09:16.813
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

01:09:16.855 --> 01:09:20.259
- What would they have wanted?
- They would have wanted to live.

01:09:21.028 --> 01:09:23.947
I tried your way, Charles.

01:09:24.194 --> 01:09:26.979
I tried to be like them.

01:09:27.655 --> 01:09:30.093
Live like them.

01:09:31.785 --> 01:09:34.829
But it always ends the same way.

01:09:36.039 --> 01:09:39.162
They took everything away from me.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.151
Now...

01:09:47.255 --> 01:09:50.664
we'll take everything from them.

01:09:57.984 --> 01:09:59.685
Hank...

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:03.620
he's not alone.

01:10:10.657 --> 01:10:12.779
Extraordinary.

01:10:13.743 --> 01:10:15.875
What do you see?

01:10:18.039 --> 01:10:20.588
The answer.

01:10:22.335 --> 01:10:24.332
Hey, Charles, wait.

01:10:37.016 --> 01:10:39.051
Oh, my God.

01:10:39.076 --> 01:10:42.380
Thank you for letting me in.

01:10:46.984 --> 01:10:48.821
Charles.
Charles, get out!

01:10:48.846 --> 01:10:50.203
Charles.

01:10:50.655 --> 01:10:53.991
I've never felt power
like this before.

01:10:53.992 --> 01:10:56.285
Charles...
Charles, get out of there.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:58.036
What's going on?
What's happening?

01:10:58.037 --> 01:10:59.660
I think...

01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:01.182
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

01:11:01.207 --> 01:11:03.830
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

01:11:05.055 --> 01:11:07.007
To connect.

01:11:15.513 --> 01:11:18.188
Always the same.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.043
And now, all this.

01:11:25.064 --> 01:11:28.620
No more stones.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.442
No more spears.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:43.591
No more slings.

01:11:46.544 --> 01:11:49.755
No more swords.

01:11:49.756 --> 01:11:53.217
No more weapons!

01:11:53.218 --> 01:11:56.967
No more systems!

01:11:57.096 --> 01:12:00.016
No more!

01:12:00.266 --> 01:12:03.966
No more superpowers.

01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:06.309
Charles!

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:10.582
Hank!

01:12:27.936 --> 01:12:30.104
What the hell is going on?

01:12:30.129 --> 01:12:32.555
Who's turning the keys?

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.182
The men are.

01:12:34.207 --> 01:12:35.800
Who green-lit the launch?

01:12:35.825 --> 01:12:37.870
Hank, do something!

01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:44.427
It won't shut down!

01:12:46.604 --> 01:12:49.481
We've lost contact
with all Trident and Polaris subs.

01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:51.445
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:54.931
So much faith in their tools...

01:12:54.956 --> 01:12:57.882
and their machines.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:13:02.286
Russia, China...
England, Israel, India.

01:13:02.287 --> 01:13:04.329
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:06.748
What's the target?
Where are they going?

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:08.792
Up, straight up.

01:13:08.793 --> 01:13:09.668
Alex...

01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:11.275
- What?
- Destroy it!

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.412
Destroy everything.
Destroy Cerebro!

01:13:18.008 --> 01:13:19.972
Wreak havoc!

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:26.108
You can fire your arrows...

01:13:26.133 --> 01:13:29.005
from the Tower of Babel...

01:13:37.696 --> 01:13:43.548
but you can never strike God!

01:13:59.886 --> 01:14:02.574
Charles.
Charles, are you okay?

01:14:19.947 --> 01:14:21.819
Erik.

01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:26.103
Charles!

01:14:27.038 --> 01:14:28.673
Alex!

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.832
Hey!
Hey, asshole!

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:33.314
All will be revealed, my child.

01:14:33.339 --> 01:14:34.621
Stop!

01:14:34.646 --> 01:14:36.142
No!

01:17:31.906 --> 01:17:33.607
Wow!

01:17:37.937 --> 01:17:39.604
Where did you...

01:17:39.605 --> 01:17:42.491
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

01:17:45.798 --> 01:17:47.545
They took him.

01:17:48.114 --> 01:17:50.532
She's the one.
It's her.

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:52.651
Are you sure?

01:17:52.676 --> 01:17:54.554
Is she gonna help us?

01:18:03.655 --> 01:18:05.542
They look up to you.

01:18:09.627 --> 01:18:11.249
Right now...

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:13.066
they need you.

01:18:16.142 --> 01:18:18.318
That's not what they need.

01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:21.931
That's awesome!

01:18:29.652 --> 01:18:30.819
What happened?

01:18:30.844 --> 01:18:32.334
Where's Alex?

01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:33.885
Where's my brother?

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.058
Pretty sure I got everybody.

01:18:38.122 --> 01:18:41.042
Alex was closest to the blast.

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:58.216
Alex...

01:19:19.538 --> 01:19:21.575
We're one click out.

01:19:21.874 --> 01:19:24.167
All right, boys.
This is it.

01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:27.177
<font color="#ff80c0">Please remain calm.</c>

01:19:27.202 --> 01:19:28.369
Scott.

01:19:28.394 --> 01:19:32.251
Medical assistance is on the way.

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:34.689
Please remain calm.

01:19:34.714 --> 01:19:38.509
Medical assistance is on the way.

01:19:38.683 --> 01:19:40.907
Please remain calm.

01:19:40.932 --> 01:19:44.806
Medical assistance is on the way.

01:19:45.418 --> 01:19:47.625
Please remain calm.

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:50.956
Medical assistance is on the way.

01:19:52.694 --> 01:19:54.908
Hey!
Moira MacTaggert!

01:19:54.933 --> 01:19:57.785
CIA!
Thank God you're here!

01:20:02.922 --> 01:20:04.678
Wait!

01:20:04.703 --> 01:20:06.440
Fire!

01:20:11.404 --> 01:20:13.105
I want her.

01:20:14.958 --> 01:20:16.725
- Him!
- Yes, sir.

01:20:17.353 --> 01:20:19.404
- Him!
- Roger that.

01:20:25.607 --> 01:20:27.453
- And her.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:27.478 --> 01:20:29.366
Alright, you heard him.
Get them on board.

01:20:29.391 --> 01:20:31.201
What about this one?

01:20:31.904 --> 01:20:33.837
Leave the kids.

01:20:39.995 --> 01:20:42.489
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:46.304
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep
of the ground.

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:55.736
Let's get them on the bird!

01:20:55.761 --> 01:20:57.260
Clear!

01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:00.868
Pack them up.
Let's go.

01:21:01.431 --> 01:21:02.867
Let's move it!
Move!

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:06.121
Thanks, Jean.
We gotta help them.

01:21:06.146 --> 01:21:08.772
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there'?

01:21:08.773 --> 01:21:10.065
What if the soldiers see us?

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:12.439
Don't worry, they won't see us.
Trust me.

01:21:14.493 --> 01:21:16.035
Hold on.

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:33.650
Kurt, get us all out of here!

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.341
I can't!

01:21:36.342 --> 01:21:39.678
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

01:21:39.703 --> 01:21:41.182
It's like Berlin all over.

01:21:41.207 --> 01:21:43.139
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:46.898
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

01:21:53.859 --> 01:21:56.151
We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.

01:21:56.176 --> 01:21:58.510
This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.

01:21:58.535 --> 01:22:02.266
It seems the entire world
has been disarmed of nuclear weapons.

01:22:02.291 --> 01:22:04.512
The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches...

01:22:04.537 --> 01:22:07.038
from Russia, as well as
the UK, Israel and China.

01:22:07.039 --> 01:22:08.306
- Look!
- Look up there!

01:22:08.331 --> 01:22:10.350
So far, there has been no response
from the White House.

01:22:10.374 --> 01:22:14.143
Eyewitness reports have been pouring in
from affiliates across the globe.

01:22:14.168 --> 01:22:19.172
Authorities are not sure
if it was an act of peace or an act of war.

01:22:25.015 --> 01:22:27.298
Our dear Father...

01:22:27.893 --> 01:22:30.364
hold me in the light of God.

01:22:34.311 --> 01:22:36.500
It should have been me.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:40.905
He was the one that was
gonna do something with his life.

01:22:40.906 --> 01:22:43.108
He was always the one.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.578
That's not how he felt.

01:22:46.799 --> 01:22:51.125
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

01:22:51.584 --> 01:22:54.929
That you were gonna
make a difference in the world.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:58.453
Maybe even change it.

01:22:58.712 --> 01:23:01.000
How do you know what he felt?

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:04.534
I know what everybody feels.

01:23:19.612 --> 01:23:22.861
Hold me in the light of God.

01:23:22.907 --> 01:23:26.110
Protect me from danger.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:29.159
Save me by your command.

01:23:29.914 --> 01:23:32.491
Listen to my prayer.

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:35.418
And keep me safe.

01:24:09.954 --> 01:24:12.257
You're blocking me.

01:24:12.282 --> 01:24:13.296
How?

01:24:13.321 --> 01:24:15.806
I can shield their minds
from your power.

01:24:15.831 --> 01:24:19.647
It's one of the many gifts
I've acquired throughout the millennia.

01:24:19.672 --> 01:24:22.465
But to see...

01:24:22.466 --> 01:24:24.510
inside a mind...

01:24:24.535 --> 01:24:26.979
to control it...

01:24:27.638 --> 01:24:29.885
that's your gift.

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:32.767
You saw it, didn't you?

01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:35.586
The glory of what's to come.

01:24:36.146 --> 01:24:38.701
You're going to take part
in all this killing...

01:24:39.459 --> 01:24:41.688
and destruction?

01:24:41.944 --> 01:24:43.361
It's all I've ever known.

01:24:43.362 --> 01:24:45.218
No, it isn't.

01:24:45.243 --> 01:24:46.430
You've just forgotten.

01:24:46.455 --> 01:24:49.078
No, Charles, I remember.

01:24:50.851 --> 01:24:52.768
Your way doesn't work.

01:24:52.793 --> 01:24:55.631
I've shown him a better way.

01:24:55.656 --> 01:24:56.838
A better world.

01:24:56.863 --> 01:25:00.674
No, you've just tapped into his rage
and pain. That's all you've done.

01:25:00.963 --> 01:25:04.424
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

01:25:04.425 --> 01:25:07.218
There is good in you, too.

01:25:07.219 --> 01:25:10.718
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

01:25:12.349 --> 01:25:14.183
I buried it...

01:25:14.184 --> 01:25:16.393
with my family.

01:25:28.808 --> 01:25:30.116
- What?
- What?

01:25:30.117 --> 01:25:31.659
What's wrong with you?

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.099
Is that going to happen
to all of us?

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:37.850
No, I just... left my
meds in the house.

01:25:37.875 --> 01:25:39.357
What happened?
Where are we?

01:25:39.382 --> 01:25:40.710
Hey!

01:25:40.711 --> 01:25:41.961
Hello, Mystique.

01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.463
Major Stryker.

01:25:43.464 --> 01:25:44.606
Colonel Stryker.

01:25:44.631 --> 01:25:46.524
I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.

01:25:46.548 --> 01:25:48.799
It may create some discomfort.

01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:52.046
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:53.918
I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.

01:25:53.943 --> 01:25:55.526
You cannot keep me here, in this...

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:57.369
Actually, I can.

01:25:57.394 --> 01:26:01.481
A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.

01:26:01.482 --> 01:26:04.796
That event emanated from exactly
where we found you.

01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:07.595
At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:11.901
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

01:26:11.927 --> 01:26:14.374
It's not him
you should be worried about.

01:26:14.399 --> 01:26:18.059
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

01:26:18.084 --> 01:26:21.295
If you let us out of here,
we can help you.

01:26:22.169 --> 01:26:25.038
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

01:26:25.124 --> 01:26:28.108
You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.

01:26:28.133 --> 01:26:30.117
What you are.

01:26:34.713 --> 01:26:36.817
Hey, Moira.

01:26:36.842 --> 01:26:38.515
What did you mean when you said...

01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:41.363
someone more powerful than Charles?

01:26:42.585 --> 01:26:44.958
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

01:26:51.198 --> 01:26:52.782
What's taking so long?

01:26:52.783 --> 01:26:54.075
I can't get in.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:56.953
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

01:26:56.954 --> 01:26:59.163
There's gotta be a way
to cut the power.

01:26:59.164 --> 01:27:00.540
Charles...

01:27:00.541 --> 01:27:02.570
you will send a message...

01:27:02.595 --> 01:27:04.737
to every living mind.

01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:08.524
You will tell them
that this earth will be laid waste.

01:27:08.549 --> 01:27:10.653
That it is I, En Sabah Nur...

01:27:10.678 --> 01:27:13.272
who will wreak this upon them.

01:27:18.617 --> 01:27:20.409
Now...

01:27:20.644 --> 01:27:23.977
deliver my message.

01:27:24.002 --> 01:27:25.818
Even if I wanted to...

01:27:25.843 --> 01:27:29.528
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.448
You don't need a machine...

01:27:33.449 --> 01:27:36.572
to amplify your powers.

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:38.966
You have me.

01:27:51.842 --> 01:27:55.170
Guys, that could be
our way out of here.

01:27:58.754 --> 01:28:01.464
You know him?
Magneto?

01:28:02.269 --> 01:28:04.312
I used to.

01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:06.182
Not so sure anymore.

01:28:06.207 --> 01:28:07.770
What was he like?

01:28:07.795 --> 01:28:12.338
Was he like they say he was?
Was he...

01:28:12.636 --> 01:28:14.238
the bad guy?

01:28:14.239 --> 01:28:16.031
No.

01:28:16.426 --> 01:28:20.237
I mean, yeah.
He was...

01:28:21.538 --> 01:28:24.707
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

01:28:24.708 --> 01:28:27.565
Yeah, but...

01:28:31.256 --> 01:28:32.924
He's my father.

01:28:32.925 --> 01:28:34.425
What?

01:28:34.426 --> 01:28:36.636
- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...

01:28:36.637 --> 01:28:37.785
Are you sure?

01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:41.200
Yeah.
He left my mom before I was born.

01:28:41.225 --> 01:28:44.294
I met him 1O years back...
but I didn't know it was him.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:47.271
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

01:28:47.272 --> 01:28:49.201
Then, this week
I saw him on TV again...

01:28:49.226 --> 01:28:51.931
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

01:28:51.956 --> 01:28:54.875
but by the time I got there...

01:28:56.657 --> 01:28:58.508
Late again.

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:02.453
You know, for a guy
who moves as fast as me...

01:29:02.454 --> 01:29:04.802
I always seem to be too late.

01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:08.209
Let's hope not this time.

01:29:08.585 --> 01:29:09.585
Yeah.

01:29:09.586 --> 01:29:10.795
Seriously.

01:29:10.796 --> 01:29:11.921
Hear me...

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:14.565
inhabitants of this world.

01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:16.759
- What is that?
- This is a message.

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:18.073
I think it's the Professor.

01:29:18.098 --> 01:29:22.442
A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.

01:29:22.474 --> 01:29:26.018
You have lost your way.

01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:28.592
You have lost your way.

01:29:28.617 --> 01:29:30.916
But I have returned.

01:29:30.941 --> 01:29:34.399
But I have returned.

01:29:34.444 --> 01:29:38.132
The day of reckoning is here.

01:29:38.485 --> 01:29:40.563
All your buildings...

01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:45.112
all of your towers and temples...

01:29:45.137 --> 01:29:46.792
Will fall.

01:29:46.817 --> 01:29:52.479
And the dawn of
a new age will rise.

01:29:52.504 --> 01:29:54.879
For there is nothing
you can do...

01:29:54.904 --> 01:29:57.294
- Jean.
- To stop what is coming.

01:29:57.319 --> 01:30:01.238
Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.

01:30:01.263 --> 01:30:03.806
Cairo.
Find us, Jean.

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:06.201
Find us. Cairo.
Find us. Jean.

01:30:06.226 --> 01:30:09.076
This message is for
one reason alone.

01:30:09.101 --> 01:30:11.689
To tell the strongest among you...

01:30:11.690 --> 01:30:15.508
Those with the greatest power...

01:30:15.533 --> 01:30:19.240
this earth will be yours.

01:30:19.265 --> 01:30:22.138
Those with the greatest power...

01:30:25.245 --> 01:30:27.618
protect those without.

01:30:30.098 --> 01:30:32.729
That's my message to the world.

01:30:37.153 --> 01:30:39.776
How was Charles doing that
without Cerebro?

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.424
Sir, what was that voice?

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:44.055
I know that voice.

01:30:44.056 --> 01:30:45.716
It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:48.159
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

01:30:48.435 --> 01:30:49.685
He just spoke to me.

01:30:49.686 --> 01:30:51.521
I think he spoke to everyone.

01:30:51.546 --> 01:30:52.807
- I could hear him, too.
- No, no...

01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:54.934
he just sent me a hidden message.

01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:57.443
One he knew only I would hear.

01:30:57.468 --> 01:30:59.250
I know where they are.

01:30:59.529 --> 01:31:01.230
Hey!

01:31:01.948 --> 01:31:04.693
We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?

01:31:05.535 --> 01:31:07.865
I have intruders in Quad Six.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:11.832
Send a security team.
Take them out.

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:21.801
The generator.
It's worth a shot.

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:23.517
Kurt?

01:31:44.658 --> 01:31:47.330
There's some kind
of animal in there.

01:31:50.288 --> 01:31:52.613
It's no animal.

01:31:53.609 --> 01:31:55.310
It's a man.

01:31:55.335 --> 01:31:57.036
Who is he?

01:31:57.754 --> 01:32:00.707
That part of him as been taken away.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:02.169
What do you mean?

01:32:02.194 --> 01:32:06.991
I mean they turned him into
some kind of weapon.

01:32:11.437 --> 01:32:14.606
Charlie Three, report.
Did you find them?

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.261
Shut it down.

01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:51.846
Fire!

01:33:02.152 --> 01:33:04.195
Weapon X is loose!

01:33:04.196 --> 01:33:07.319
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

01:33:07.344 --> 01:33:09.009
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

01:33:09.034 --> 01:33:11.281
You sure he's not an animal?

01:33:15.616 --> 01:33:19.036
- He's into the central halls.
- Engaging target Sector Five.

01:33:19.723 --> 01:33:21.402
We can't stop h...

01:33:36.561 --> 01:33:37.993
Hey!

01:33:58.291 --> 01:34:00.070
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

01:34:00.095 --> 01:34:02.419
- I just lost feed.
- Hey! What's going on here?

01:34:02.444 --> 01:34:03.578
Hey!

01:34:04.172 --> 01:34:05.896
I'll be right back.

01:34:08.599 --> 01:34:10.346
No!

01:34:26.562 --> 01:34:29.273
Hey!
Stay where you are!

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:33.042
- No, no.
- Stop!

01:34:48.508 --> 01:34:50.130
Scott, wait.

01:34:51.996 --> 01:34:54.157
I can help you.

01:34:59.477 --> 01:35:01.209
Jean.

01:35:39.351 --> 01:35:41.183
Logan.

01:36:29.234 --> 01:36:31.344
What'd you do to him?

01:36:32.272 --> 01:36:36.007
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:38.947
Just the few memories
I could reach.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.544
I hope that's the last
we've seen of that guy.

01:37:02.177 --> 01:37:03.756
Kurt.

01:37:05.895 --> 01:37:07.396
- What?
- What?

01:37:07.397 --> 01:37:08.948
Hey.

01:37:13.445 --> 01:37:15.946
Stay away from the... door.

01:37:15.947 --> 01:37:17.239
The what?

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:18.677
The door...

01:37:18.702 --> 01:37:19.950
Stay away from the...

01:37:19.951 --> 01:37:21.243
- Get away from the door!
- The door!
- The door!

01:37:21.244 --> 01:37:22.411
On three.

01:37:22.412 --> 01:37:24.868
One... two...

01:37:37.635 --> 01:37:39.303
We know where the Professor is.

01:37:39.304 --> 01:37:40.804
I think we might have
a way out of here.

01:37:40.805 --> 01:37:44.480
- Well, you've been busy.
- We had a little help.

01:37:44.809 --> 01:37:46.260
Let's g0!

01:37:49.064 --> 01:37:50.121
Jesus!

01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:51.398
Oh, sorry!

01:37:51.399 --> 01:37:53.121
This way!

01:38:01.993 --> 01:38:04.661
This was meant to be
the center of the universe

01:38:04.662 --> 01:38:06.580
before I was betrayed.

01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:08.332
Now...

01:38:08.333 --> 01:38:10.477
it will be.

01:39:30.415 --> 01:39:31.845
Nice.

01:39:31.942 --> 01:39:34.741
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

01:39:35.697 --> 01:39:38.053
Yeah, I can figure it out.

01:39:38.948 --> 01:39:40.686
Hey, guys.

01:39:41.009 --> 01:39:42.903
Flight suits.

01:39:46.479 --> 01:39:48.557
You got your warplane.

01:39:48.558 --> 01:39:50.635
Let's go to war.

01:39:57.192 --> 01:39:59.109
A gift...

01:39:59.110 --> 01:40:02.011
from the past you left behind...

01:40:02.113 --> 01:40:05.532
and the future that lies ahead.

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:10.037
You will reach down, my son.

01:40:10.038 --> 01:40:12.331
Deep into the earth.

01:40:12.332 --> 01:40:15.751
Rip everything they've
built from the ground.

01:40:15.752 --> 01:40:18.607
Wipe clean this world.

01:40:18.632 --> 01:40:22.309
And we will lead those
that survive...

01:40:22.334 --> 01:40:25.427
into a better one.

01:40:25.428 --> 01:40:27.259
And me?

01:40:28.271 --> 01:40:31.565
Am I to play a role
in this madness?

01:40:32.435 --> 01:40:36.551
You have the most
important role of all.

01:40:47.367 --> 01:40:49.576
Were you scared?

01:40:49.577 --> 01:40:51.866
That day in D.C.,
were you scared?

01:40:51.891 --> 01:40:53.433
No.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.696
But I was scared
on my first mission.

01:41:01.965 --> 01:41:04.524
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

01:41:04.549 --> 01:41:06.331
About your age.

01:41:09.389 --> 01:41:12.221
We called ourselves the X-Men.

01:41:13.159 --> 01:41:15.143
Your brother was there.

01:41:15.144 --> 01:41:17.062
We used to call him Havok.

01:41:17.063 --> 01:41:19.568
He was a real handful, but...

01:41:20.942 --> 01:41:23.942
when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

01:41:25.863 --> 01:41:28.699
What happened to the rest of the kids
who went with you'?

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.572
The X-Men?

01:41:32.755 --> 01:41:35.253
Hank and I are
the only ones left.

01:41:35.581 --> 01:41:38.124
I couldn't save
the rest of them.

01:41:38.418 --> 01:41:40.640
I told you, I'm not a hero.

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.497
Well, you're a hero to us.

01:41:43.506 --> 01:41:45.424
Seeing you that day on TV

01:41:45.425 --> 01:41:47.263
changed my life.

01:41:47.288 --> 01:41:49.080
Mine, too.

01:41:49.105 --> 01:41:50.806
Mine, too.

01:41:52.223 --> 01:41:55.549
I mean, I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...

01:41:55.574 --> 01:41:57.714
everything else is...

01:41:59.464 --> 01:42:01.859
It's pretty much the same.

01:42:03.088 --> 01:42:05.165
I'm a total loser.

01:43:04.567 --> 01:43:06.938
What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...

01:43:06.963 --> 01:43:09.984
on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.

01:43:10.009 --> 01:43:12.651
The ground is full
of magnetic elements.

01:43:12.676 --> 01:43:14.388
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

01:43:14.389 --> 01:43:16.932
The ocean's floor
is lined with them, too.

01:43:16.933 --> 01:43:19.875
It's already begun
at the lowest depths.

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.063
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

01:43:23.064 --> 01:43:25.953
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

01:43:25.978 --> 01:43:28.461
anything built since the Bronze Age...

01:43:28.486 --> 01:43:29.945
will be wiped away.

01:43:29.946 --> 01:43:31.367
The death toll
will be in the billions.

01:43:31.391 --> 01:43:34.721
He's talking about
the whole goddamn world.

01:44:23.143 --> 01:44:25.310
You're just another false god.

01:44:25.543 --> 01:44:28.003
And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...

01:44:28.004 --> 01:44:31.459
they will betray you again.

01:44:33.301 --> 01:44:35.635
You're wrong, Charles.

01:44:35.636 --> 01:44:39.263
For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...

01:44:39.288 --> 01:44:41.289
I have you.

01:44:41.392 --> 01:44:47.388
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.607
To be...

01:44:49.632 --> 01:44:52.255
everywhere.

01:44:54.572 --> 01:44:56.507
To be...

01:44:56.532 --> 01:44:58.652
everyone.

01:45:13.591 --> 01:45:16.012
Seventh wonder, 12 o'clock.

01:45:23.768 --> 01:45:26.687
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

01:45:27.106 --> 01:45:30.673
He's going to transfer
his consciousness into the Professor.

01:45:30.698 --> 01:45:32.544
If he does that,
he'll have the power

01:45:32.569 --> 01:45:35.404
to control every
mind in the world.

01:45:41.869 --> 01:45:44.820
What the hell is that?

01:45:45.096 --> 01:45:46.968
It's Erik.

01:45:56.050 --> 01:45:58.987
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

01:45:59.971 --> 01:46:02.404
Get Charles.
I'll take care of Erik.

01:46:02.429 --> 01:46:04.730
How are we gonna
get through that?

01:46:05.309 --> 01:46:07.143
I can get you in there.

01:46:07.144 --> 01:46:09.609
I came here for him.
Let me help you.

01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:12.704
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

01:46:12.728 --> 01:46:15.274
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

01:46:15.403 --> 01:46:16.653
We'll catch up.

01:46:16.654 --> 01:46:18.284
Hold on.

01:46:48.273 --> 01:46:49.649
Hank, you go with the kids.

01:46:49.674 --> 01:46:51.930
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

01:46:52.356 --> 01:46:53.523
What?

01:46:53.524 --> 01:46:56.359
Not all of us can
fully control our powers.

01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.028
Then don't.

01:46:58.029 --> 01:47:00.402
You need to embrace them.

01:47:03.034 --> 01:47:04.826
We all do.

01:47:28.154 --> 01:47:31.227
Go.
Join the others.

01:47:31.228 --> 01:47:35.102
Protect me,
until the transference is complete.

01:47:59.472 --> 01:48:01.674
There's an entrance.
It's clear.

01:48:05.429 --> 01:48:07.722
Kurt!
Get in there!

01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:19.862
In the pyramid!
Move!

01:48:20.027 --> 01:48:21.528
Go!

01:48:57.679 --> 01:48:59.505
Split them up.

01:49:22.339 --> 01:49:24.040
Professor...

01:49:27.344 --> 01:49:28.678
Kurt, you have to hurry!

01:49:28.679 --> 01:49:31.673
I'm trying.
It's like a maze in here.

01:49:41.192 --> 01:49:42.804
Kurt, no!

01:50:07.718 --> 01:50:10.528
The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.

01:50:12.602 --> 01:50:14.394
Erik!

01:50:20.843 --> 01:50:22.544
Mystique.

01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:29.253
I know you think
you've lost everything.

01:50:29.949 --> 01:50:32.005
But you haven't.

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:35.036
You have me.

01:50:35.412 --> 01:50:37.534
You have Charles.

01:50:43.151 --> 01:50:45.954
You have more family
than you know.

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.394
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

01:50:50.872 --> 01:50:53.088
But you do now.

01:50:55.266 --> 01:50:57.934
That's what I've come here
to tell you.

01:51:03.148 --> 01:51:04.871
And you?

01:51:13.617 --> 01:51:15.131
I'm your...

01:51:19.623 --> 01:51:22.178
I'm here for my family, too.

01:52:11.252 --> 01:52:13.294
Get out.
Get out!

01:52:13.319 --> 01:52:15.255
GET OUT!

01:52:21.393 --> 01:52:23.194
Auf Wiedersehen.

01:52:34.392 --> 01:52:36.253
We're losing him.

01:52:51.970 --> 01:52:53.709
I'll be right back.

01:53:04.275 --> 01:53:06.420
Scott, glasses on!

01:53:15.663 --> 01:53:17.205
Let's go!

01:53:33.491 --> 01:53:35.499
- Locked on.
- Here we go.

01:53:52.538 --> 01:53:54.410
Psylocke!

01:54:10.048 --> 01:54:11.965
What the hell was that?

01:54:18.175 --> 01:54:19.469
Kurt.

01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:21.044
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:22.472
I've never done it
with this many people.

01:54:22.473 --> 01:54:24.242
Get us out of here.

01:54:39.323 --> 01:54:41.195
Kurt, hurry!

01:54:42.153 --> 01:54:43.613
Kurt!

01:55:09.103 --> 01:55:10.844
Charles...

01:55:16.133 --> 01:55:17.393
Is he okay?

01:55:17.418 --> 01:55:19.899
It's his energy.
He's drained.

01:55:20.931 --> 01:55:22.198
Get out.

01:55:22.223 --> 01:55:24.200
Get...
Get out!

01:55:24.201 --> 01:55:27.343
Professor. Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:29.454
It's okay.

01:55:37.744 --> 01:55:40.805
I'm going to fight
for what I have left.

01:55:43.875 --> 01:55:45.701
Are you?

01:55:58.503 --> 01:56:01.007
There's so much more to you
than you know.

01:56:01.196 --> 01:56:04.006
Not just pain and anger.

01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:06.743
There's good, too.
I felt it.

01:56:06.768 --> 01:56:08.823
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

01:56:08.848 --> 01:56:13.237
Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.

01:56:13.262 --> 01:56:15.948
And it needs you, Erik.

01:56:44.872 --> 01:56:47.266
Useless.

01:56:52.331 --> 01:56:54.374
Charles.

01:56:55.792 --> 01:56:58.702
I know you can hear me.

01:56:58.896 --> 01:57:02.766
We're still connected.

01:57:05.663 --> 01:57:07.364
Charles!

01:57:07.721 --> 01:57:09.843
Show yourself!

01:57:10.194 --> 01:57:12.497
Charles!

01:57:13.101 --> 01:57:15.575
Show yourself!

01:57:44.925 --> 01:57:47.453
Foolish child.

01:57:55.539 --> 01:57:57.104
Peter.

01:58:13.826 --> 01:58:15.625
End him.

01:58:41.597 --> 01:58:43.298
Raven.

01:58:50.532 --> 01:58:52.698
The great hero.

01:58:57.150 --> 01:58:59.373
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

01:58:59.374 --> 01:59:00.898
No.

01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:02.780
It's me he wants.

01:59:02.805 --> 01:59:04.855
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.922
If he has you, he has us all.

01:59:06.923 --> 01:59:08.587
The whole world.

01:59:08.612 --> 01:59:10.294
You are feeble.

01:59:10.319 --> 01:59:12.448
Just like the others.

01:59:12.473 --> 01:59:14.276
Charles!

01:59:14.301 --> 01:59:15.336
Come!

01:59:15.361 --> 01:59:17.688
Rescue your weaklings!

01:59:17.713 --> 01:59:20.807
Give your life for theirs!

01:59:21.938 --> 01:59:23.639
No.

01:59:31.283 --> 01:59:33.030
He was right.

01:59:33.475 --> 01:59:36.678
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

01:59:36.703 --> 01:59:37.798
Charles!

01:59:37.823 --> 01:59:39.294
I can get inside his head.

01:59:39.319 --> 01:59:41.819
Will you do nothing?

01:59:42.751 --> 01:59:45.203
Thank you for letting me in.

02:00:02.646 --> 02:00:04.495
You want what I have?

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.094
You want to feel what I feel?

02:00:18.328 --> 02:00:20.371
Welcome to my world!

02:00:21.832 --> 02:00:23.870
You're in my house now!

02:00:33.728 --> 02:00:36.394
You'll need a bigger house.

02:01:55.269 --> 02:01:56.991
You betray me?

02:01:57.016 --> 02:01:58.628
No.

02:01:58.845 --> 02:02:01.025
I betrayed them.

02:02:28.625 --> 02:02:29.889
Let's jump.

02:02:29.914 --> 02:02:31.359
What?

02:02:36.132 --> 02:02:37.674
Cover me.

02:02:39.594 --> 02:02:41.373
I got you.

02:02:46.268 --> 02:02:47.825
Come on!

02:03:08.849 --> 02:03:11.661
They lack strength, Charles.

02:03:17.553 --> 02:03:19.056
Jean.

02:03:24.472 --> 02:03:26.345
Come here.

02:03:38.215 --> 02:03:39.607
Help...

02:03:42.049 --> 02:03:43.582
me.

02:03:48.256 --> 02:03:49.809
Stay here.

02:03:58.917 --> 02:04:01.020
They can't stop him.

02:04:01.134 --> 02:04:03.006
Jean.

02:04:04.721 --> 02:04:07.370
Help me!

02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:31.661
Hank!

02:04:32.465 --> 02:04:34.119
Hank!

02:04:40.576 --> 02:04:43.703
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

02:04:43.728 --> 02:04:46.021
You're mine now.

02:04:47.764 --> 02:04:50.794
You will never win.

02:04:50.819 --> 02:04:53.096
And why is that?

02:04:53.125 --> 02:04:55.265
Because you are alone.

02:04:57.062 --> 02:05:01.116
And I am not!

02:05:12.633 --> 02:05:14.210
Let...

02:05:14.235 --> 02:05:15.999
go.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.664
Unleash your power, Jean.

02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:21.367
No fear.

02:06:08.357 --> 02:06:11.322
Unleash your power!

02:06:11.347 --> 02:06:13.569
Let go, Jean!

02:06:13.594 --> 02:06:16.322
JEAN, LET GO!

02:06:51.304 --> 02:06:53.374
He's getting away.

02:07:10.448 --> 02:07:14.233
All is revealed.

02:08:15.943 --> 02:08:18.318
Charles!
Charles!

02:08:19.142 --> 02:08:20.309
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:22.144
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

02:08:22.145 --> 02:08:23.645
Charles...

02:08:23.646 --> 02:08:25.440
No, he's not.

02:08:26.193 --> 02:08:28.145
I can still feel him.

02:08:51.853 --> 02:08:53.987
Thank you, Jean.

02:08:55.428 --> 02:08:57.129
Charles?

02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.827
Charles, do you know where you are?

02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:04.780
I'm on a beach.

02:09:10.416 --> 02:09:12.448
In Cuba.

02:09:13.867 --> 02:09:15.530
With you.

02:09:15.531 --> 02:09:17.469
What beach?

02:09:24.433 --> 02:09:26.148
Charles Xavier.

02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:54.292
I'm sorry.

02:09:54.570 --> 02:09:57.732
I should never have taken
those from you.

02:10:00.435 --> 02:10:02.151
Hold on!

02:10:06.457 --> 02:10:08.287
What did I miss?

02:10:10.628 --> 02:10:13.255
It seems only by the grace of God...

02:10:13.256 --> 02:10:14.631
that the ominous destruction...

02:10:14.656 --> 02:10:16.563
seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.

02:10:16.587 --> 02:10:20.457
At a debriefing held earlier today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...

02:10:20.482 --> 02:10:22.514
revealed to an investigative committee...

02:10:22.515 --> 02:10:25.642
The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr

02:10:25.643 --> 02:10:28.227
aided in defeating this
powerful and unknown mutant.

02:10:28.252 --> 02:10:30.606
I think our prayers were answered.

02:10:31.107 --> 02:10:32.691
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:10:32.692 --> 02:10:34.675
The potential destructive power
of mutants is sure to fuel

02:10:34.699 --> 02:10:36.611
new controversy and debate...

02:10:36.612 --> 02:10:40.741
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.

02:11:07.523 --> 02:11:10.358
Mystique told me he is your father.

02:11:11.022 --> 02:11:13.183
Are you gonna tell him?

02:11:14.481 --> 02:11:16.182
I might...

02:11:16.274 --> 02:11:17.958
one day.

02:11:18.988 --> 02:11:22.217
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

02:11:27.701 --> 02:11:29.573
Me, too.

02:11:39.926 --> 02:11:43.553
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

02:11:43.554 --> 02:11:46.284
It's human nature, Charles.

02:11:47.667 --> 02:11:49.818
I still have hope.

02:11:50.084 --> 02:11:51.785
Oh, yes.

02:11:52.605 --> 02:11:54.397
"Hope."

02:11:54.524 --> 02:11:56.903
I was right about Raven.

02:11:57.234 --> 02:11:59.698
I was even right about you.

02:12:02.281 --> 02:12:04.483
What about the rest
of the world?

02:12:05.302 --> 02:12:08.925
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

02:12:10.581 --> 02:12:13.792
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

02:12:13.793 --> 02:12:15.972
and your children.

02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:19.291
It does, indeed.

02:12:19.316 --> 02:12:21.867
What do you do
when you wake up to that?

02:12:23.261 --> 02:12:25.753
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

02:12:25.778 --> 02:12:29.291
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

02:12:34.230 --> 02:12:37.149
You're sure I can't
convince you to stay?

02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:40.402
You're psychic, Charles.

02:12:40.403 --> 02:12:43.114
You can convince me
to do anything.

02:12:45.074 --> 02:12:47.194
Goodbye, old friend.

02:12:47.785 --> 02:12:50.033
Good luck, Professor.

02:12:54.667 --> 02:12:57.186
Forget everything you think you know.

02:12:58.181 --> 02:13:01.259
Whatever lessons you learned
in school...

02:13:01.379 --> 02:13:03.927
whatever your parents taught you.

02:13:05.315 --> 02:13:08.859
None of that matters!

02:13:09.599 --> 02:13:12.017
You're not kids anymore.

02:13:12.018 --> 02:13:14.345
You're not students.

02:13:17.788 --> 02:13:20.099
You're X-Men.
