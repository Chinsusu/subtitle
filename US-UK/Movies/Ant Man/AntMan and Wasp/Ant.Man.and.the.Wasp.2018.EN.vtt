<i>I still think about the night</i>

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.540
<i>your mother and I
had to leave you.</i>

00:00:11.718 --> 00:00:13.687
Hopefully, it's not for long,

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.757
but I'll call you
when we get settled.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.426
When I have a better
indication of what's going on.

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:18.430
Mommy?

00:00:21.536 --> 00:00:23.105
Jellybean.

00:00:25.277 --> 00:00:27.882
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip...

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:30.487
so Rose is gonna stay with you
for a few days.

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.824
No. I don't want you to go.

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:35.830
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:37.301
I won't be able to keep my...

00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:38.768
eyes...

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:45.149
Goodbye, sweetheart.
All right, we'll see you soon.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.521
Okay.

00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:49.156
Janet, we gotta go.

00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:54.199
<i>I wish we could have
put down our bags...</i>

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.738
<i>tucked you back into your bed...</i>

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.545
<i>but too many lives
were at stake.</i>

00:01:03.487 --> 00:01:04.888
Oh, my God.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.692
They've already launched.

00:01:06.694 --> 00:01:07.961
We have to stop it.

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:08.963
Come on.

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:21.321
<i>To disarm the missile,
we had to get inside it...</i>

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:24.294
<i>but the plating was too thick.</i>

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:26.800
<i>The only way in was to shrink
between the molecules.</i>

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:31.943
I can't get through.

00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:35.014
Hank.

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:38.621
<i>We both knew
that if you go that small...</i>

00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:39.690
<i>there is no coming back.</i>

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:44.802
<i>It should have been me,
but my regulator was damaged.</i>

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.942
<i>Your mother's wasn't.</i>

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:51.514
Tell Hope I love her.

00:01:51.516 --> 00:01:52.518
<i>She turned it off.</i>

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:54.820
Janet. No!

00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:56.626
<i>She went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.</i>

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.876
<i>Your mother saved
thousands of lives that day</i>

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:08.949
<i>knowing she'd be lost
in the quantum realm.</i>

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:11.390
<i>Alone.</i>

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:12.790
<i>Afraid.</i>

00:02:13.826 --> 00:02:15.530
<i>Gone forever.</i>

00:02:30.794 --> 00:02:33.998
<i>Telling you that she wasn't
coming home...</i>

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.705
<i>was the hardest thing
that I ever had to do.</i>

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:43.017
But then Scott showed up.

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.992
Or should I say,
broke into our house.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.030
<i>And when he went
to the quantum realm...</i>

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.707
<i>and came back.</i>

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.911
<i>Everything changed.</i>

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:00.751
I started to wonder...

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:02.757
could your mother
still be alive?

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:07.401
So, I dusted off some old plans.

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:18.890
Dad, what are you saying?

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:23.766
I think it's possible
to bring her back.

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:04.782
Okay. We're in.

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:10.257
Oh, this place is a maze.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:12.129
Where's that map?

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.870
We're definitely close.

00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:19.041
- You ready?
- I'm ready, Daddy.

00:04:19.043 --> 00:04:20.844
Are you sure?
'Cause once we're inside,

00:04:20.846 --> 00:04:23.014
you show any hesitation
or fear, we're done.

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:25.154
I eat fear for breakfast.

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:27.759
Wow. That is super cool.

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:28.862
Come on.

00:04:33.137 --> 00:04:36.642
Look! It's Anton.
He'll show us the way.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:38.113
Anton, which way do we go?

00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:42.990
Anton, which way do we go?

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.941
Thanks, Anton!

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:56.916
Look, the ants have burrowed
into the tech facility.

00:04:56.918 --> 00:04:58.622
Oh no, lasers!

00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:02.798
Oh! I think I got lased!

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:07.072
The secret vault.

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.409
Tell me you brought
the contact lens.

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.081
Yup.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.091
Perfect! Right there.

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:22.435
There!
It's the micro-treasure!

00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:24.805
My trophy?

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:26.108
It looks like treasure.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.777
Oh, it is to me.

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.115
I want to take it
to show-and-tell.

00:05:29.117 --> 00:05:30.250
Oh, no, you can't do that.

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:33.824
You can't. It never leaves
the house. It's too important.

00:05:33.826 --> 00:05:35.827
This is the best birthday
present you ever got me.

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:37.130
I'm so touched you think

00:05:37.132 --> 00:05:39.134
I'm the world's
greatest grandma.

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:40.435
It was the only one they had.

00:05:40.437 --> 00:05:42.240
It makes me want
to knit you a sweater.

00:05:44.413 --> 00:05:45.813
Oh, no, the fuzz!

00:05:45.815 --> 00:05:46.983
Hey, Scotty...

00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:48.120
I was looking at the schematics

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:49.488
for the Karapetyan buildings...

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.858
and I think we have

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.127
way too many security cameras,
don't we?

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.462
No, no, not at all.

00:05:53.464 --> 00:05:54.897
I mean, 'cause it's a lot
of security cameras.

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:56.269
I know what he needs.

00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:58.038
Who's the security expert
in our business?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.940
You are, but I'm running
the company, right?

00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:00.009
And if we overquote him...

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:01.110
he's gonna go somewhere else.

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:02.214
I mean, we gotta land this bird.

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:03.483
He ain't goin' anywhere.

00:06:03.485 --> 00:06:05.019
And the expression is
"land this fish."

00:06:05.021 --> 00:06:06.421
No, it's "land the bird."

00:06:06.423 --> 00:06:07.791
Just like you land the plane.

00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:09.026
You gotta land the plane
to be in business.

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:10.230
I know it's silly to get hung up

00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:11.865
on these kinds of things,
but I do.

00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:13.235
How am I gonna land a fish?

00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:15.238
It can't walk.
And if it swam up on shore...

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.877
and it battled a hawk,
who's gonna win?

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.315
You've really turned me around
on this thing.

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:22.286
It's okay.
We're gonna land Karapetyan.

00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:23.589
Now, if you just excuse me...

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:24.858
I'm in the middle of trying to

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.993
steal something
with my daughter.

00:06:25.995 --> 00:06:27.130
I'm gonna go recheck it.

00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:29.336
To the escape ant!

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:33.843
Let's bounce
before the po-po come back!

00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:36.882
The po-po?
How do you even know that?

00:06:36.884 --> 00:06:38.485
Let's fly, Antoinette!
Let's fly!

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.310
Crash landing!

00:06:51.312 --> 00:06:52.447
Whoo!

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.521
I wish we could shrink for real.

00:06:56.523 --> 00:06:58.659
Oh. That is pretty cool.

00:06:58.661 --> 00:07:00.462
Hey, I'm headed
to the office, Scotty.

00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:01.899
And sorry about freaking out
earlier, you know.

00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:03.233
But I feel like I'm way better.

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:05.337
My heart is definitely beating
way too hard and stuff.

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:06.474
And my hands are shaking.

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:08.077
But I think it's unrelated,
you know?

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:09.281
It's gonna be great, Luis!

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:10.382
You got nothing to worry about!

00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:13.255
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss.

00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:14.356
I'm the boss.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:14.358 --> 00:07:15.627
Daddy!

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:24.043
Come on, Woo!
I've got three days left.

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:25.411
Why would I try to escape?

00:07:25.413 --> 00:07:27.483
Sorry, Scott,
but rules are rules.

00:07:27.485 --> 00:07:28.954
You trip the perimeter alarm,
we search the place.

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:31.058
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.558
Thank you.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.031
It was an accident. My foot
went through the fence.

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:37.170
Our flying ant crashed.

00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:38.570
Hey, you try and entertain
a 10-year-old

00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:39.974
when you can't leave the house.

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.045
You know the lengths
that I've gone to?

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.685
Close-up magic.

00:07:47.994 --> 00:07:49.627
I learned that.

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.333
Why can't you just leave
my daddy alone?

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:55.072
Oh, Cassie.

00:07:55.074 --> 00:07:57.142
This must all seem like
a bunch of confusing

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.012
grown-up stuff to you, huh?

00:07:59.014 --> 00:08:00.615
Well, think of it this way.

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:02.420
Your school has rules, right?

00:08:02.422 --> 00:08:04.522
Like, you can't draw
on the walls.

00:08:04.524 --> 00:08:06.526
Well, your daddy went to Germany

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:08.630
and drew on the walls
with Captain America.

00:08:08.632 --> 00:08:11.271
And that was a violation
of Article 16,

00:08:11.273 --> 00:08:13.341
Paragraph Three
of the Sokovia Accords.

00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:15.478
Now, as a part of
his joint plea deal...

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.716
with Homeland Security
and the German government...

00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:19.586
he was allowed to return
to the U.S...

00:08:19.588 --> 00:08:22.224
provided he serve two years
under house arrest...

00:08:22.226 --> 00:08:24.128
followed by three years
of probation.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.101
And avoid any unauthorized
activities, technology...

00:08:27.103 --> 00:08:29.373
or contact with any
former associates who were...

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.579
or currently are
in violation of said Accords.

00:08:32.581 --> 00:08:34.148
Or any related statutes.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.386
Okay, sweetie?

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:39.258
Wow. You're really great
with kids.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.531
Thanks.
I'm also a youth pastor.

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.834
Anyway, not to be
a Johnny ask-a-lot...

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.406
but you haven't had any contact

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:46.840
with Hank Pym
or Hope Van Dyne, have you?

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.679
- No.
- You sure?

00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:50.748
Because it's only a matter
of time before we get 'em.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.387
It was their tech, so they
violated the Accords, too.

00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:56.392
And associating with them
breaks your deal.

00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:58.699
And, uh, I don't need
to remind you...

00:08:58.701 --> 00:09:00.502
that any violation
of your agreement

00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:02.539
means 20 years in prison.
Minimum.

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:04.843
I haven't talked to Hank
or Hope in forever.

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:05.813
They hate his guts.

00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:06.817
Thanks, peanut.

00:09:08.821 --> 00:09:10.156
How'd you do it, Scott?

00:09:10.657 --> 00:09:11.691
Do what?

00:09:12.895 --> 00:09:14.832
The card trick.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.500
Seriously?

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.204
Oh, my God!

00:09:19.206 --> 00:09:21.576
You people
can't just show up here

00:09:21.578 --> 00:09:22.847
whenever you want
and search the place.

00:09:22.849 --> 00:09:23.949
Actually, they can.

00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:25.217
You need a warrant.

00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:26.419
Actually, they don't.

00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:28.557
Really? Wow.

00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:30.361
Did you pack your soccer shoes?

00:09:30.363 --> 00:09:33.233
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:35.537
Next time I see you will be
on the outside.

00:09:35.539 --> 00:09:37.575
All right.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.277
Oh, get on the inside of this.

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:42.384
Hey, three days.
Seriously...

00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:43.653
- I'm proud of you, bud.
- Thank you.

00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:44.989
You know what?
Give me another one.

00:09:44.991 --> 00:09:47.427
Me too!
Gosh! Freedom!

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:50.001
New business!
I am sensing greatness.

00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:51.737
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.

00:09:51.739 --> 00:09:53.840
Me too, peanut. But just wait
till next weekend.

00:09:53.842 --> 00:09:56.479
Once I'm outta here, you and I are
gonna go paint this town red.

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:59.618
We'll have so much ice cream,
we'll never stop puking.

00:10:07.035 --> 00:10:08.570
You're gettin' good at that.

00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:09.640
How'd you do that?

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:10.642
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.216
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:19.326
Three days.

00:10:19.726 --> 00:10:21.329
Easy-peasy.

00:10:29.681 --> 00:10:32.518
<i>Snap your fingers. That gets
them to look over there.</i>

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.357
<i>And that is misdirection.</i>

00:10:38.097 --> 00:10:39.532
<i>♪ We had a dream</i>

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:41.536
<i>♪ We'd go travelin' together</i>

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:44.378
<i>♪ We'd spread a little lovin'
then we'd keep movin' on ♪</i>

00:11:13.535 --> 00:11:16.507
Easy-peasy.

00:11:23.522 --> 00:11:24.857
<i>Where are you?</i>

00:11:33.543 --> 00:11:35.513
<i>Everything that you know...</i>

00:11:39.219 --> 00:11:40.887
<i>Lost...</i>

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:43.093
<i>in the quantum realm.</i>

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.511
<i>What?</i>

00:11:52.513 --> 00:11:54.581
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.

00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:01.728
I found you!

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.701
You always find me, Mommy.

00:12:04.703 --> 00:12:06.606
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.775
Hey, Hank!
It's been a while.

00:12:24.777 --> 00:12:28.648
Um, I don't even know if
this is your number anymore.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.884
And I'm probably the last person

00:12:29.886 --> 00:12:31.255
you wanna hear from.

00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:34.929
But I just had
a really weird dream.

00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:36.131
And I know that doesn't

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:37.267
sound like an emergency
or anything...

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:42.243
but it just felt very real.

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:45.249
I was back
in the quantum realm...

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:48.623
and I think I saw your wife.

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:50.758
And then I was your wife.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.600
I mean, not in a weird way
or anything.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.141
You know, hearing this out loud,

00:12:58.143 --> 00:13:00.680
I'm thinking, uh,
it's not an emergency.

00:13:00.682 --> 00:13:02.686
I'm sorry to bother you.

00:13:03.953 --> 00:13:06.125
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:18.681
<i>That means, one tiny atom
in my fingernail could be...</i>

00:13:19.787 --> 00:13:23.826
<i>Could be one,
little, tiny universe.</i>

00:13:57.761 --> 00:13:58.763
Hope?

00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:02.738
Is this another dream?

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.940
Do you think it was a dream...

00:14:03.942 --> 00:14:06.346
or is it possible that you
really saw my mom down there?

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:08.716
I'm not sure.

00:14:12.225 --> 00:14:13.791
I can't be here!

00:14:13.793 --> 00:14:15.496
I can't be here!
I'm under house arrest!

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:18.134
They won't open while
the system's engaged, Scott.

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:41.079
You have to take me home.
They could show up any second!

00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:42.281
Relax. As far as your
nanny cops know,

00:14:42.283 --> 00:14:43.283
you're still at home.

00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:51.368
Whoa!

00:14:57.214 --> 00:14:58.449
Scotty?

00:14:58.451 --> 00:15:00.352
<i>He's programmed to
replicate your daily routine.</i>

00:15:00.354 --> 00:15:02.088
Nine hours in bed.

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.390
Five hours in front of the TV.

00:15:03.392 --> 00:15:05.494
Two hours in the bathroom,
whatever that's about.

00:15:05.496 --> 00:15:07.265
That's totally inaccurate.

00:15:07.267 --> 00:15:08.969
And how do you know
about my daily routine?

00:15:08.971 --> 00:15:09.969
Are you spying on me?

00:15:09.971 --> 00:15:12.007
We keep tabs on all
security threats, all right?

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:13.879
And so far the biggest one
we've had is you.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.924
I'm sorry about Germany.
They just showed up.

00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:21.460
They said it was
a matter of national security.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:23.097
That Cap needed help, so...

00:15:23.099 --> 00:15:24.133
Cap?

00:15:25.201 --> 00:15:28.373
Tain America.
Captain. Cap.

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:30.444
It's what we call him.

00:15:30.446 --> 00:15:32.180
If you're a friend.

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:33.283
I'm not saying I'm a friend
of... A little, I know him.

00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:35.153
He's nice. Whatever.

00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:37.624
I'm sorry! All right?
I didn't think I'd get caught.

00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:39.146
You didn't think
about a lot of things.

00:15:40.365 --> 00:15:42.100
How's Hank?

00:15:42.102 --> 00:15:44.037
We're still running. The house
is gone, so is our freedom.

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.440
How do you think he is?

00:15:45.442 --> 00:15:47.445
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad.

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.047
I'm not looking
for an apology, Scott.

00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:50.651
The only reason
why we're even talking is...

00:15:50.653 --> 00:15:52.255
because we need
what's in your head.

00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:34.070
Is this where you're living?

00:16:34.072 --> 00:16:37.612
If you need help or money
or something, maybe I can...

00:16:37.614 --> 00:16:39.214
We're fine.

00:17:36.329 --> 00:17:38.266
Hey, Hank.
Look, I just wanna...

00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:40.269
Save it!

00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:44.813
- Can we start?
- Yeah.

00:17:46.249 --> 00:17:48.452
So, while you were relaxing
at home...

00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:50.859
we were building this.

00:17:51.795 --> 00:17:53.798
It's a tunnel.
To the quantum realm.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:17:56.434
To my mom.

00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:57.536
We think she might still
be down there.

00:17:57.538 --> 00:17:58.439
We just don't know where.

00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:00.342
What?

00:18:00.344 --> 00:18:02.514
If we can pinpoint
my mom's location...

00:18:02.516 --> 00:18:04.617
then the pod can take me down
to get her.

00:18:04.619 --> 00:18:05.753
You built all this
and you don't even know

00:18:05.755 --> 00:18:07.323
if she's alive?

00:18:07.325 --> 00:18:09.393
It's called a hypothesis.

00:18:09.395 --> 00:18:12.298
Last night, we powered up
the tunnel for the first time.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.571
It was overloaded
and it shut down.

00:18:14.573 --> 00:18:16.275
But for a split second,

00:18:16.277 --> 00:18:18.814
the doorway to the
quantum realm was opened.

00:18:19.916 --> 00:18:21.084
And?

00:18:21.086 --> 00:18:24.224
And five minutes later,
you called, talking about Mom.

00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:26.427
We think
when you were down there,

00:18:26.429 --> 00:18:27.963
you may have entangled with her.

00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:29.969
Hank, I would never do that.
I respect you too much.

00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:32.539
Quantum entanglement, Scott.

00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:33.843
We think she might have put

00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.011
some kind of a message
in your head.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.982
Hopefully, a location.

00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:38.786
And opening the tunnel
triggered it.

00:18:38.788 --> 00:18:40.657
Your mom put a message
in my head?

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:42.426
Come on. That's insane.

00:18:42.428 --> 00:18:43.662
No, Scott.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.067
Insane is going to Germany

00:18:46.069 --> 00:18:48.604
without telling us,
and fighting the Avengers.

00:18:48.606 --> 00:18:51.679
Just tell me you weren't lying
about the suit you took.

00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:54.851
Tell me you really destroyed it.

00:18:54.853 --> 00:18:57.021
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.

00:18:57.023 --> 00:18:58.893
I can't believe
you destroyed my suit!

00:18:59.863 --> 00:19:01.765
That was my life's work!

00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:03.000
What was I supposed to do?

00:19:03.002 --> 00:19:05.907
You were supposed to not
take my suit!

00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:07.075
I'm sorry, Hank!

00:19:07.077 --> 00:19:08.711
I'm sorry I took the suit.

00:19:08.713 --> 00:19:11.084
I'm sorry
that I called last night.

00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:12.886
I don't remember
seeing Janet down there.

00:19:12.888 --> 00:19:14.391
I wish that I did.

00:19:14.393 --> 00:19:15.293
I just had a dream about her

00:19:15.295 --> 00:19:16.895
playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

00:19:20.372 --> 00:19:21.372
What?

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.747
I had a dream.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:28.552
She was playing hide-and-seek
with a little girl.

00:19:28.554 --> 00:19:30.421
Cassie and I do it all the time.

00:19:30.423 --> 00:19:31.824
Doesn't mean anything.

00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:33.763
But was it Cassie in the dream?

00:19:33.765 --> 00:19:35.030
No.

00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:36.501
Where was she hiding?

00:19:36.503 --> 00:19:38.036
- What?
- The little girl.

00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:39.875
Where was she hiding?
Was it in a wardrobe?

00:19:40.811 --> 00:19:43.516
No, it was in a tall dresser.

00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:44.816
You mean a wardrobe.

00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:46.119
Is that what that's called?

00:19:46.121 --> 00:19:47.590
What color was it?

00:19:48.428 --> 00:19:49.428
Red.

00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:52.900
Were there horses on it?

00:19:53.436 --> 00:19:54.571
Oh, boy.

00:19:55.907 --> 00:19:58.611
It's where I hid
every time that we played.

00:19:59.181 --> 00:20:00.582
It doesn't sound like

00:20:00.584 --> 00:20:02.421
you really got the gist
of the game.

00:20:04.192 --> 00:20:05.626
She's alive.

00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:09.032
I knew it.

00:20:09.936 --> 00:20:11.104
I knew it!

00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.209
We need to get that part.

00:20:14.211 --> 00:20:15.578
Okay.

00:20:17.818 --> 00:20:19.251
The sooner we get
the tunnel working...

00:20:19.253 --> 00:20:20.654
the sooner we can get
this message out of his head.

00:20:20.656 --> 00:20:22.026
Does Burch have it?

00:20:22.028 --> 00:20:23.527
- Yeah. Let's go.
- What part?

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:25.466
Who's Burch?
Wait. What's happening?

00:20:27.104 --> 00:20:28.705
We need a component
to stop the tunnel

00:20:28.707 --> 00:20:30.275
from overloading again.

00:20:30.277 --> 00:20:32.815
I grabbed your clothes.
You might want to change.

00:20:42.299 --> 00:20:44.037
Look, I'd really like
to help you...

00:20:45.306 --> 00:20:46.673
but if I'm not at home
when they come

00:20:46.675 --> 00:20:47.875
to take off my ankle monitor...

00:20:47.877 --> 00:20:49.312
then I'm going away forever.

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:51.651
Once we get the component
and power up the tunnel...

00:20:51.653 --> 00:20:53.654
we'll get the message,
and have you home by lunch.

00:20:53.656 --> 00:20:55.792
We have to hurry.
The entanglement won't last.

00:20:55.794 --> 00:20:57.662
You owe us.

00:20:57.664 --> 00:20:59.667
All right, fine.
But can I just wait inside?

00:20:59.669 --> 00:21:01.229
Because I'm not supposed
to be out here.

00:21:11.124 --> 00:21:12.259
Let's go.

00:21:29.894 --> 00:21:31.796
- We good?
- Yeah.

00:21:31.798 --> 00:21:33.166
I'll be right back.

00:21:40.717 --> 00:21:43.152
- Can I have one of these?
- No.

00:21:57.016 --> 00:22:00.386
Ah. Susan! Welcome to <i>Oui!</i>

00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:02.190
Sonny!

00:22:02.192 --> 00:22:04.394
<i>Oui</i> is French
for "yes."

00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:06.734
As in "yes" to farm-to-table,
"yes" to locally sourced...

00:22:06.736 --> 00:22:09.107
and "yes" to planet
before profit.

00:22:10.276 --> 00:22:12.142
Well, let's hope
it also means "yes"

00:22:12.144 --> 00:22:13.744
to "Do you have the component
I ordered?"

00:22:16.188 --> 00:22:18.355
You know, I have always loved
your sense of humor, Susan.

00:22:18.357 --> 00:22:19.726
Have a seat.

00:22:19.728 --> 00:22:20.460
No, I'm good. Thank you.

00:22:20.462 --> 00:22:22.331
Who is this guy?

00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:25.971
Sonny Burch. He traffics
in black market technology.

00:22:25.973 --> 00:22:28.093
He's been getting us what
we need to build the tunnel.

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:31.482
Could I just have one...

00:22:31.484 --> 00:22:33.754
No.

00:22:33.756 --> 00:22:36.861
You know, I have
a special friend at the FBI.

00:22:36.863 --> 00:22:38.194
And I say "special"...

00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:41.068
because, well,
he tells me things

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.740
that I didn't previously know.

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:45.143
For example...

00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:47.113
your name isn't Susan.

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:50.053
It's Hope Van Dyne.

00:22:50.055 --> 00:22:53.160
And your unseen associate,
that's your father, Hank Pym.

00:22:53.162 --> 00:22:55.098
- That's not good, Hank.
- No shit.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.049
What do you want?

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.386
Relationships
are built on trust, Hope.

00:23:07.388 --> 00:23:09.591
And I want our relationship
to have a strong foundation.

00:23:09.593 --> 00:23:11.228
Our relationship?

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.168
My business landscape
has been shifting, Hope.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:15.903
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA
don't even exist anymore...

00:23:15.905 --> 00:23:18.209
but now, Hank Pym...

00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.478
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.915
Do you have a point?

00:23:21.917 --> 00:23:23.184
Oh, you think that I don't know

00:23:23.186 --> 00:23:25.524
what you've been building
with all this?

00:23:25.526 --> 00:23:28.229
Quantum technology.

00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:30.867
Now, you can forget nanotech,
forget AI,

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:32.003
forget cryptocurrency.

00:23:32.005 --> 00:23:33.940
Quantum energy is the future.

00:23:33.942 --> 00:23:35.610
It's the next gold rush.

00:23:35.612 --> 00:23:36.577
Is that so?

00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:38.549
I want in, Hope.

00:23:38.551 --> 00:23:41.189
So, as a gesture of good will,
I have taken the liberty...

00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:43.060
of arranging some buyers
for your lab.

00:23:43.895 --> 00:23:44.895
Starting bid...

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:48.937
one billion dollars.

00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:50.507
Thank you, Sonny, really.

00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.009
But my father and I
have something

00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:54.382
slightly more pressing
than starting a business.

00:23:54.384 --> 00:23:57.688
So I'll just take
the component as arranged.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.894
My buyers don't take
no for an answer.

00:24:01.263 --> 00:24:03.231
So, we are either
in business together...

00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:05.538
or we aren't
in business together.

00:24:08.644 --> 00:24:10.546
Then I guess we aren't.

00:24:10.548 --> 00:24:13.251
You can go.

00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:16.057
But I'm afraid your money's
gonna have to remain.

00:24:16.059 --> 00:24:18.396
Let's call it compensation
for my injured feelings.

00:24:19.231 --> 00:24:21.100
Listen, Sonny.

00:24:21.102 --> 00:24:23.739
This is gonna be
so much easier on everybody

00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:25.442
if you just give me
that component.

00:24:25.444 --> 00:24:27.513
Darlin', the only thing
you're takin' from here...

00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:31.122
is my heart,
but it will mend in time.

00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:33.927
Okay.

00:24:42.377 --> 00:24:43.779
So, now what?

00:24:43.781 --> 00:24:46.182
You'll see.

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:48.121
She said her and her daddy
had something pressing.

00:24:48.123 --> 00:24:49.288
- Mmm-hmm.
- I want to know what it is

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.325
because if they're not
working with us...

00:24:50.327 --> 00:24:51.763
they're working with somebody.
So find out.

00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:53.163
I want some names...

00:24:57.777 --> 00:24:59.379
Hold on, you gave her wings?

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.592
Get her.

00:25:23.227 --> 00:25:24.707
Not my turn-of-the-century
chandelier!

00:25:29.172 --> 00:25:30.708
Stop firing! Stop!

00:25:35.483 --> 00:25:36.923
All right, take this.
Go. Go, go, go!

00:25:37.454 --> 00:25:38.454
Go!

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.918
Wings and blasters.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.853
So I take it you didn't have
that tech available for me.

00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:45.855
No, I did.

00:26:47.894 --> 00:26:50.599
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, Sonny.

00:26:50.601 --> 00:26:53.304
Oh, our business
isn't finished yet, Hope.

00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:54.540
I can assure you of that!

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.859
What in the hell is that?

00:27:17.954 --> 00:27:19.456
Dad, are you seeing this?

00:27:19.458 --> 00:27:20.460
Hope, get out of there!

00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:30.546
- I gotta do something.
- Wait!

00:27:36.358 --> 00:27:39.364
It is still a work in progress.

00:27:58.034 --> 00:27:59.134
You taught me
that kick. Remember?

00:27:59.136 --> 00:28:00.705
Yeah, great form.

00:28:00.707 --> 00:28:02.641
Those were the days.
Whatever happened to us?

00:28:02.643 --> 00:28:04.077
Not the time, Scott.

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.081
Damn it, where'd it go?

00:28:08.087 --> 00:28:09.189
I've lost it.

00:28:09.191 --> 00:28:11.057
<i>I'm not seeing anything
on the ant cams.</i>

00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:12.996
<i>Try looking...</i>

00:28:12.998 --> 00:28:13.999
Dad?

00:28:22.683 --> 00:28:24.518
Give me that.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.522
Now.

00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:31.132
- Are you okay?
- No!

00:28:31.134 --> 00:28:32.200
He got the lab.

00:28:32.202 --> 00:28:33.603
No.

00:28:33.605 --> 00:28:34.607
Come on!

00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:38.179
What was that?

00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:39.783
I don't know.

00:28:39.785 --> 00:28:41.719
But we need to find somewhere
to regroup

00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.557
and figure out where the lab is.

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.894
So, where to now?

00:28:45.896 --> 00:28:47.698
How about my house? Hmm?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.867
I'm supposed to be there anyway,

00:28:48.869 --> 00:28:50.069
and Woo could walk in
any second.

00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:52.240
Exactly why we're not going
to your house.

00:28:52.242 --> 00:28:53.644
What about your house?

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.682
Sorry.

00:28:56.684 --> 00:28:59.190
Well, there is one place
I can think of.

00:29:00.124 --> 00:29:01.125
No.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.998
No, no, no, no!

00:29:05.737 --> 00:29:06.738
No!

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:11.712
Wow, Dr. Pym...

00:29:11.714 --> 00:29:13.115
who would've thought that,

00:29:13.117 --> 00:29:14.584
once again,
in your hour of need...

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.721
that you would turn to us,
you know?

00:29:16.723 --> 00:29:17.725
Not me.

00:29:18.028 --> 00:29:20.263
Mmm. Help yourself.

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:21.331
Hey, what's up
with the fancy pastry?

00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.001
We gotta keep
the food budget down.

00:29:23.003 --> 00:29:24.972
Well, what are we supposed
to have for breakfast?

00:29:24.974 --> 00:29:25.941
The oatmeal packets.

00:29:25.943 --> 00:29:27.911
Oatmeal packets.

00:29:27.913 --> 00:29:29.648
- It's insult.
- Why is it an insult?

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.816
Because it tastes like sand.

00:29:30.818 --> 00:29:32.286
You know why?
'Cause it's organic.

00:29:32.288 --> 00:29:33.756
It's not organic, it's sand.

00:29:33.758 --> 00:29:34.792
It's the most important meal
of the day.

00:29:34.794 --> 00:29:35.826
You know what,
you can get creative with it.

00:29:35.828 --> 00:29:37.096
Break teeth.

00:29:37.098 --> 00:29:37.965
Put a little brown sugar on it.
You can put some cinnamon.

00:29:37.967 --> 00:29:38.767
Put a little honey.
Whatever you want...

00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:42.607
Guys, guys, guys.
Come on, man.

00:29:42.609 --> 00:29:44.244
We got bigger fish to fry.

00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:45.981
Is that my desk?

00:29:45.983 --> 00:29:47.817
- Yeah.
- What?

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.254
Why do I have such a small desk?

00:29:49.256 --> 00:29:50.757
Because you weren't there
when we were choosing desks.

00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:51.825
You snooze, you lose.

00:29:51.827 --> 00:29:52.929
Well, I was under house arrest.

00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:53.965
Yeah.

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:54.965
You know what,
this isn't even a desk.

00:29:54.967 --> 00:29:56.267
This is garbage.

00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:59.007
You found this outside
amongst garbage.

00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:00.411
I got it at a rummage sale.

00:30:00.413 --> 00:30:01.879
So, you save money on my desk?

00:30:01.881 --> 00:30:03.114
Guys.

00:30:03.116 --> 00:30:05.285
Hope, please,
we need to focus, all right?

00:30:05.287 --> 00:30:07.290
We gotta find
that lab already. Jeez.

00:30:08.428 --> 00:30:10.028
Oh, you know what?
I heard stories,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.230
like what happened to you.

00:30:11.232 --> 00:30:13.235
This crazy, creepy cat, who
walks through walls and stuff.

00:30:13.237 --> 00:30:15.105
Like a ghost.

00:30:15.107 --> 00:30:16.811
Like Baba Yaga.

00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:22.720
Baba Yaga, the witch.

00:30:22.722 --> 00:30:25.094
They tell stories to children
to frighten them.

00:30:26.328 --> 00:30:27.664
You know Baba Yaga?

00:30:28.902 --> 00:30:30.303
Whoever stole it...

00:30:30.305 --> 00:30:32.038
we need to find it.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.814
Oh, you don't find someone
like that. They find you.

00:30:35.816 --> 00:30:37.918
Like Baba Yaga.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.456
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest
genius I know.

00:30:40.458 --> 00:30:43.027
Didn't you put some kind of
LoJack on your lab?

00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:44.197
Because if you didn't,

00:30:44.199 --> 00:30:46.334
we have a variety
of affordable options.

00:30:46.336 --> 00:30:50.042
Of course I did, Luis.
It was disabled.

00:30:50.044 --> 00:30:52.748
Whoever stole the lab knew
exactly what they were doing.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.484
They also looked like
they were phasing.

00:30:54.486 --> 00:30:55.853
Phasing?

00:30:55.855 --> 00:30:57.490
Quantum phasing.
When an object moves

00:30:57.492 --> 00:30:59.026
through different states
of matter.

00:30:59.028 --> 00:31:00.830
Oh, yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

00:31:00.832 --> 00:31:01.931
The lab emits radiation.

00:31:01.933 --> 00:31:05.037
Can we modify a quantum
spectrometer and track it?

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:07.777
That could work, yes, but all
my equipment is in the lab.

00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:09.347
Where else can we find
that equipment?

00:31:11.353 --> 00:31:13.123
Well, there is one person.

00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:15.860
Bill Foster.

00:31:15.862 --> 00:31:17.062
Great!

00:31:17.064 --> 00:31:18.799
Who's Bill Foster?

00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:20.870
He's an old colleague of
my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:31:20.872 --> 00:31:22.940
They had a falling out
years ago.

00:31:22.942 --> 00:31:24.812
You seem to have a lot of
falling outs with people.

00:31:24.814 --> 00:31:26.949
It's probably
just a waste of time.

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:28.885
Hey, I'm risking everything
by being here.

00:31:28.887 --> 00:31:30.353
Don't you think we should check?

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:32.392
We need to find out
who took the lab.

00:32:25.165 --> 00:32:26.667
Guys, it's not a good idea

00:32:26.669 --> 00:32:28.270
to be out in the open like this.

00:32:28.272 --> 00:32:31.443
Relax,
no one's gonna recognize us.

00:32:31.445 --> 00:32:33.614
What, because of hats
and sunglasses?

00:32:33.616 --> 00:32:35.352
That's not a disguise, Hank.

00:32:35.354 --> 00:32:37.555
We look like ourselves
at a baseball game.

00:32:37.557 --> 00:32:39.994
<i>In an isolated system...</i>

00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:44.536
particles co-exist in
a stable phase relationship.

00:32:44.538 --> 00:32:46.574
If the system
is interfered with,

00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:50.081
that stability becomes chaos.

00:32:50.083 --> 00:32:52.084
Unpredictable.

00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:55.090
Dangerous.
Beautiful.

00:32:55.092 --> 00:32:57.094
Isolated completely,
a quantum system

00:32:57.096 --> 00:32:59.632
would revert back to
separate states of matter...

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:03.341
each entangled with a distinct
state of its environment.

00:33:03.343 --> 00:33:06.013
In other words,
the object in question

00:33:06.015 --> 00:33:07.649
would be both
in and out of phase...

00:33:07.651 --> 00:33:10.657
with multiple
parallel realities.

00:33:16.067 --> 00:33:19.739
Speaking of being out of phase
with reality.

00:33:19.741 --> 00:33:22.644
I am noticing
an unusually high number

00:33:22.646 --> 00:33:24.816
of glazed eyes out there
among you.

00:33:25.755 --> 00:33:29.123
So, why don't we call it
a few minutes early?

00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:30.393
That'll be enough for today.

00:33:30.395 --> 00:33:32.115
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, you may go.

00:33:34.135 --> 00:33:37.674
It's incredible.
You're linked to Janet.

00:33:37.676 --> 00:33:40.113
It's quantum entanglement
between the quantum states of

00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:42.117
Posner molecules in your brains.

00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:44.321
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:45.391
Do you guys
just put the word "quantum"

00:33:45.393 --> 00:33:46.459
in front of everything?

00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:48.197
Doctor, we need to find our lab.

00:33:48.199 --> 00:33:49.599
Hope, I'd love to help you...

00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:50.734
but I don't have anything

00:33:50.736 --> 00:33:51.902
like the equipment
you're describing.

00:33:51.904 --> 00:33:53.842
I told you this is a waste
of time. Come on, let's go.

00:33:53.844 --> 00:33:55.376
Don't condescend, Hank.

00:33:55.378 --> 00:33:57.547
You're the one who's
on the run from the FBI.

00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:59.451
All because
you had to grow to a size

00:33:59.453 --> 00:34:01.323
that finally fit your ego.

00:34:01.325 --> 00:34:04.527
That wasn't me in Germany.
It was this idiot.

00:34:04.529 --> 00:34:05.531
Really?

00:34:07.337 --> 00:34:09.606
Going that big,
it must've been exhausting.

00:34:09.608 --> 00:34:11.775
I slept for three days
straight. You have no idea.

00:34:11.777 --> 00:34:13.246
Actually, I do.

00:34:13.248 --> 00:34:14.883
Back in the day,
I was Hank's partner

00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:16.786
on a project called Goliath.

00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:18.488
Excuse me?
You were my partner?

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.528
The only thing more tiring
than going that big

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.632
is putting up
with Hank's bullshit.

00:34:22.634 --> 00:34:23.769
Right...

00:34:25.505 --> 00:34:28.478
I don't know.
How big did you get?

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.182
My record? 21 feet.

00:34:31.184 --> 00:34:32.517
- Not bad.
- You?

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:33.619
I don't...

00:34:33.621 --> 00:34:34.623
No, really, I'm curious.

00:34:35.626 --> 00:34:37.528
- 65 feet. Yeah.
- Whoa!

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.499
- Huge.
- 65.

00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:42.204
If you two are finished
comparing sizes...

00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:44.374
we need to figure out a way
to track down the lab.

00:34:44.376 --> 00:34:47.514
And the great Hank Pym hasn't
figured that one out yet?

00:34:47.516 --> 00:34:49.385
Strange.

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:51.289
You had all the answers
back in the day.

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:52.657
That's why I left the project.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.728
Left? I fired you.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.298
Best decision I ever made.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.537
Hank was a terrible partner.
Temperamental...

00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:00.807
stubborn, impatient.

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:02.746
Sooner or later,
he just pushed everyone away.

00:35:02.748 --> 00:35:04.414
Just the mediocrities.

00:35:04.416 --> 00:35:06.586
Janet was the only one
who could endure him

00:35:06.588 --> 00:35:07.554
and chose to stick it out.

00:35:07.556 --> 00:35:08.923
Watch it, Bill.

00:35:08.925 --> 00:35:10.494
She paid the price,
though, didn't she?

00:35:10.496 --> 00:35:11.563
You son of a bitch.

00:35:11.565 --> 00:35:13.932
I didn't come here
to listen to you two squabble.

00:35:13.934 --> 00:35:15.670
I'm trying to save my mother.

00:35:16.907 --> 00:35:18.342
Now, which office would you say?

00:35:18.344 --> 00:35:19.346
Oh, it's Woo.

00:35:20.414 --> 00:35:21.849
Someone must have seen me.

00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:23.385
Relax.
If this is about you,

00:35:23.387 --> 00:35:24.789
they'd be in your house by now.

00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:28.764
What are you, 15?

00:35:28.766 --> 00:35:29.900
Come on.
We gotta go right now.

00:35:29.902 --> 00:35:33.606
Wait. You might be able to
improvise that tracker...

00:35:33.608 --> 00:35:34.641
if you modify
the diffraction units

00:35:34.643 --> 00:35:36.378
on one of your regulators.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.550
- That could work.
- I don't know what that means.

00:35:38.552 --> 00:35:40.356
Thank you. Thank you.

00:35:51.777 --> 00:35:53.445
But, Doctor, campus police says

00:35:53.447 --> 00:35:55.349
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.

00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:56.719
I don't know
what to tell you, Agent.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.722
I haven't talked to Hank
in 30 years.

00:35:58.724 --> 00:35:59.659
I can assure you
I'm the last person

00:35:59.661 --> 00:36:00.927
he would want to visit.

00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:01.862
Oh, come on, you expect us to...

00:36:01.864 --> 00:36:02.866
Hey, hey.

00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:05.434
Why is that?

00:36:05.436 --> 00:36:07.940
Simple.
We hate each other's guts.

00:36:08.978 --> 00:36:10.813
So I'm a terrible partner?

00:36:10.815 --> 00:36:13.083
Foster, he hasn't had
one good idea

00:36:13.085 --> 00:36:14.653
in his unremarkable career.

00:36:14.655 --> 00:36:16.592
But his idea about the
diffractors could work, right?

00:36:16.594 --> 00:36:18.729
Fine, one decent idea.

00:36:18.731 --> 00:36:20.666
Except, I eliminated
the diffractors

00:36:20.668 --> 00:36:22.372
when I upgraded the suits.

00:36:24.876 --> 00:36:27.079
So, if we had an old suit,

00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:29.517
we might be able
to track down the lab?

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:30.655
Yes, but we don't.

00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:34.762
- What if we did?
- What do you mean?

00:36:36.166 --> 00:36:37.166
I mean...

00:36:38.471 --> 00:36:39.804
life's funny.

00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:41.641
Oh, my God.
You didn't destroy the suit.

00:36:41.643 --> 00:36:42.976
What?

00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.450
Well, it was
your life's work, Hank.

00:36:45.452 --> 00:36:46.653
I couldn't destroy that.

00:36:48.088 --> 00:36:49.525
Before I turned myself in,

00:36:49.527 --> 00:36:50.860
I shrunk it down
and mailed it to Luis.

00:36:50.862 --> 00:36:53.630
You sent my suit
through the mail?

00:36:53.632 --> 00:36:55.503
Hey, the postal service
is very reliable.

00:36:55.505 --> 00:36:58.775
You know, they do tracking
numbers now. Like UPS.

00:36:58.777 --> 00:37:00.144
Where is it?

00:37:00.146 --> 00:37:02.717
It's in a very safe place,
all right? Don't worry.

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:05.523
What, the trophy?
No, it's not here.

00:37:05.525 --> 00:37:06.925
What do you mean it's not
there? Where could it be?

00:37:06.927 --> 00:37:08.561
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.

00:37:08.563 --> 00:37:10.030
Hey, get away from the plant.

00:37:10.032 --> 00:37:11.804
But I put it back
after Cassie and I...

00:37:12.972 --> 00:37:14.574
Show-and-tell.

00:37:14.576 --> 00:37:15.577
Scotty?

00:37:17.681 --> 00:37:19.517
No, stop!

00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:21.588
Well, the good news is
I know where it is.

00:37:28.068 --> 00:37:29.637
Whenever you go
back to school...

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:31.307
isn't everything supposed to
look so much smaller?

00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:32.809
This place seems huge.

00:37:32.811 --> 00:37:34.012
<i>What is it?</i>

00:37:34.014 --> 00:37:35.248
It's the new regulator.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.251
Hank, what's
going on with this suit?

00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:39.023
How much of
a work in progress is this?

00:37:40.561 --> 00:37:43.664
Uh-oh.
No, no, no.

00:37:51.884 --> 00:37:52.885
Oh.

00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.858
What are you, laughing?
Please, could you just...

00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.129
Okay, okay.

00:38:02.737 --> 00:38:04.072
<i>What do you see?</i>

00:38:04.074 --> 00:38:06.144
The sizing coils
are malfunctioning.

00:38:06.146 --> 00:38:07.847
Just let me...

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:09.184
Ow!

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:12.288
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

00:38:14.996 --> 00:38:17.165
Okay. All right.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.103
Try that.

00:38:23.313 --> 00:38:24.313
Sorry.

00:38:25.217 --> 00:38:26.218
What?

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.425
Awesome.

00:38:31.427 --> 00:38:33.764
If only Cap could see you now.

00:38:33.766 --> 00:38:35.368
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do?

00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:47.925
Hey!

00:38:47.927 --> 00:38:49.063
Where's your hall pass?

00:38:51.068 --> 00:38:52.371
Hey, I'm talking to you.

00:38:54.273 --> 00:38:55.273
Hey!

00:38:56.445 --> 00:38:58.081
Hey. Eh...

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:24.967
You can do it.

00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:27.072
You almost got it.

00:39:39.264 --> 00:39:41.000
Oh, peanut.

00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:54.994
Okay, let's go.

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:13.262
Hiya, champ,
how was school today?

00:40:14.434 --> 00:40:16.871
All right, get your jokes out now.
Can you fix the suit?

00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:18.505
So cranky.

00:40:18.507 --> 00:40:21.146
You want a juice box
and some string cheese?

00:40:21.148 --> 00:40:23.184
Do you really have that?

00:40:32.936 --> 00:40:34.205
Let's see if Foster was right.

00:40:48.001 --> 00:40:49.170
This has gotta be the lab.

00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:54.476
Let's go get it.

00:40:54.478 --> 00:40:55.480
Yeah.

00:41:04.967 --> 00:41:06.235
This seems right.

00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:10.978
Look at us, teaming
up twice in one day.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.612
Makes you think, huh?

00:41:12.614 --> 00:41:13.648
About what?

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.554
Germany.

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:16.523
What do you mean?

00:41:16.525 --> 00:41:19.561
We were working together,
training together...

00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:22.568
and other stuffing together.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:24.673
If I had asked you,
would you have come?

00:41:24.675 --> 00:41:26.376
I guess we'll never know.

00:41:26.378 --> 00:41:27.776
But I do know one thing.

00:41:27.778 --> 00:41:29.347
What?

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:31.720
If I had,
you'd have never been caught.

00:41:39.637 --> 00:41:41.472
Hey, Scott.

00:41:41.474 --> 00:41:43.610
You think you can stop
daydreaming about my daughter

00:41:43.612 --> 00:41:45.280
long enough to get my lab?

00:41:45.282 --> 00:41:47.119
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

00:41:52.563 --> 00:41:54.465
Okay, you're transmitting.

00:41:54.467 --> 00:41:55.666
What took you so long?

00:41:55.668 --> 00:41:58.271
Sorry, I had to come
up with a name for my ant.

00:41:58.273 --> 00:42:00.376
I'm thinking
Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.

00:42:00.813 --> 00:42:02.179
You like it?

00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:03.349
Hilarious.

00:42:04.452 --> 00:42:06.488
<i>I'm not getting anything
on the monitors.</i>

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:08.592
There's some kind of
electronic disturbance.

00:42:08.594 --> 00:42:09.795
<i>Be careful.</i>

00:42:09.797 --> 00:42:11.597
You know me, Hank.
I'm always careful... Whoa!

00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:14.503
It's okay.
It's just the suit.

00:42:14.505 --> 00:42:15.708
- How do you know?
- Look.

00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:21.217
That's Ghost?

00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:22.487
What is she doing?

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:23.655
Do you think that suit is how

00:42:23.657 --> 00:42:25.793
she goes through walls
and stuff?

00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:27.664
Let's just get outta
here before she wakes up.

00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:29.637
Hope,
look! There's the lab.

00:42:35.514 --> 00:42:37.550
Now, we're sure
this is our shrunken building

00:42:37.552 --> 00:42:38.751
and not somebody else's, right?

00:42:38.753 --> 00:42:40.657
Just take it, Scott.
Come on, we gotta be fast.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.862
I'll get it.

00:42:44.699 --> 00:42:46.168
Oh, shit...

00:42:58.726 --> 00:43:01.197
Hope. Hope! Hank.

00:43:01.632 --> 00:43:03.267
Guys.

00:43:03.269 --> 00:43:05.507
I don't think they can hear you.

00:43:07.844 --> 00:43:09.347
Hi.

00:43:09.782 --> 00:43:11.418
I'm Ava.

00:43:11.619 --> 00:43:12.888
Scott.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.896
So, you don't need the suit...

00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:20.803
to go through things.

00:43:21.606 --> 00:43:23.307
No.

00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:26.447
It just helps me control it.

00:43:27.985 --> 00:43:31.724
And the pain, supposedly.

00:43:36.369 --> 00:43:37.769
You're not gonna reach
into my chest

00:43:37.771 --> 00:43:39.005
and crush my heart, are you?

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.317
You're funny.

00:43:47.458 --> 00:43:50.231
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott,
unless I have to.

00:43:52.702 --> 00:43:54.439
I need...

00:43:55.807 --> 00:43:57.612
what's in your head.

00:44:11.907 --> 00:44:13.441
Let's wake up
the rest of the gang

00:44:13.443 --> 00:44:14.723
and get this over with,
shall we?

00:44:17.483 --> 00:44:18.518
Get up!

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:20.322
Come on!

00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:24.030
Dad?

00:44:26.503 --> 00:44:28.637
Don't ever touch him again.

00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.808
Now, now, Hope...

00:44:31.077 --> 00:44:32.679
I think I'm being rather
gentle with your father,

00:44:32.681 --> 00:44:33.715
all things considered.

00:44:34.985 --> 00:44:36.623
What the hell
are you talking about?

00:44:37.523 --> 00:44:40.628
Another casualty
of Hank Pym's ego.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.001
Bill.

00:44:44.737 --> 00:44:46.673
What have you done?

00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:49.380
It's what you've done,
Dr. Pym.

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:51.416
You're with her?

00:44:51.418 --> 00:44:53.820
Oh, man.
I thought you were cool.

00:44:53.822 --> 00:44:55.825
What the hell is going on here?

00:44:55.827 --> 00:44:57.831
I doubt Hank has
ever mentioned my father.

00:44:59.001 --> 00:45:00.668
Why would he?

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.539
Elihas Starr.

00:45:03.675 --> 00:45:06.079
They were colleagues
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:45:06.081 --> 00:45:08.615
Quantum research.

00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:12.758
Until my father dare disagree
with the great Hank Pym.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:14.561
You had him fired.

00:45:14.563 --> 00:45:16.433
Oh, and discredited
for good measure.

00:45:19.775 --> 00:45:23.715
My father tried to continue
his research on his own.

00:45:25.219 --> 00:45:28.155
Desperate to restore his name,
so he took risks.

00:45:28.157 --> 00:45:29.159
No, no, no!

00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:31.197
Too many.

00:45:32.601 --> 00:45:34.570
<i>Until something went wrong.</i>

00:45:35.507 --> 00:45:37.041
He told us to run.

00:45:37.043 --> 00:45:38.008
Elihas, what's happening?

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.778
Just go. Go!

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:42.184
Daddy! Daddy!

00:45:42.186 --> 00:45:43.454
<i>I could tell he was scared.</i>

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.865
Daddy!

00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:50.969
Ava, no!

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.012
<i>I didn't want him to be alone.</i>

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:58.751
No! No!

00:46:06.735 --> 00:46:08.771
<i>When I woke up,
my parents were dead.</i>

00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:13.246
<i>I wasn't so lucky.</i>

00:46:18.224 --> 00:46:21.030
<i>They call it
"molecular disequilibrium."</i>

00:46:22.298 --> 00:46:24.635
<i>A rather dull name, I think.</i>

00:46:24.637 --> 00:46:27.842
<i>Doesn't quite do justice
to what it means.</i>

00:46:27.844 --> 00:46:31.749
Every cell in my body
is torn apart...

00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:33.086
and stitched back together.

00:46:34.023 --> 00:46:35.958
Over and over.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.597
Every day.

00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:41.103
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D.
when I got the call

00:46:41.105 --> 00:46:43.608
about a quantum anomaly
in Argentina.

00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:47.981
Hello, Ava.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.688
My name's Bill.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.159
I was a friend of your father's.

00:46:55.331 --> 00:46:56.634
I brought you something.

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:03.280
It's all right.
Try again.

00:47:05.018 --> 00:47:06.851
That's it.

00:47:06.853 --> 00:47:09.125
<i>Dr. Foster did his best
to keep me safe.</i>

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:11.795
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:47:11.797 --> 00:47:14.001
saw an opportunity
in my affliction.

00:47:17.476 --> 00:47:19.144
<i>They built me
a containment suit,</i>

00:47:19.146 --> 00:47:21.481
<i>so I could control my phasing.</i>

00:47:21.483 --> 00:47:23.083
<i>And trained me
to be a stealth operative.</i>

00:47:24.356 --> 00:47:25.358
<i>They weaponized me.</i>

00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.295
<i>I stole for them.
Spied for them.</i>

00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:32.104
<i>Killed for them.</i>

00:47:32.106 --> 00:47:34.307
And in exchange for my soul...

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:36.047
they were going to cure me.

00:47:39.385 --> 00:47:41.157
They lied.

00:47:42.291 --> 00:47:45.229
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed,
I took Ava in.

00:47:45.231 --> 00:47:47.099
I built the chamber
to slow her decay,

00:47:47.101 --> 00:47:48.469
but her condition
was progressive.

00:47:48.471 --> 00:47:49.873
I didn't know how to cure it.

00:47:51.244 --> 00:47:54.079
She wanted to kill you, Hank,
but I told her no...

00:47:54.081 --> 00:47:55.483
and that she should
watch you instead.

00:47:55.485 --> 00:47:57.019
And sure enough, she discovered

00:47:57.021 --> 00:47:58.341
that you were
building the tunnel.

00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:02.563
Then, she told me about Lang.

00:48:02.565 --> 00:48:05.103
And the message from Janet
inside his head,

00:48:05.105 --> 00:48:06.472
that's when I...

00:48:06.474 --> 00:48:07.807
Christ's sake!

00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:09.276
That's me. I'm sorry.

00:48:09.278 --> 00:48:10.880
Look, can you tell me
who's texting me?

00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:13.586
"Cassie, 911."

00:48:13.588 --> 00:48:15.889
That's my daughter.
I need to text her back.

00:48:15.891 --> 00:48:17.293
No, that's not happening.

00:48:17.295 --> 00:48:19.363
What, it's 911.
That means it's an emergency.

00:48:19.365 --> 00:48:21.166
You're not making
demands here, Lang.

00:48:21.168 --> 00:48:23.204
You're not appreciating
the gravity of the...

00:48:24.175 --> 00:48:26.077
Okay, look, she's trying
to video chat me now.

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:28.950
Something might be wrong.
Let me talk to her. Please.

00:48:31.456 --> 00:48:33.425
Cassie, are you okay?
What's the emergency?

00:48:33.427 --> 00:48:35.061
<i>I can't find my soccer shoes.</i>

00:48:35.063 --> 00:48:36.430
What?

00:48:36.432 --> 00:48:37.499
<i>I have a game tomorrow.</i>

00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:38.469
<i>Hey, Scott,
I know that they're there.</i>

00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:40.440
<i>Can you just walk the phone
around the house?</i>

00:48:40.442 --> 00:48:41.976
No, I can't do that right now.

00:48:41.978 --> 00:48:44.079
- <i>Why not?</i>
- Because I'm sick.

00:48:44.081 --> 00:48:44.849
<i>Hey, can you just
maybe look around</i>

00:48:44.851 --> 00:48:46.115
<i>later then and call me back?</i>

00:48:46.117 --> 00:48:47.420
<i>Please? Thank you.</i>

00:48:47.422 --> 00:48:48.990
<i>Bye, Daddy!</i>

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:50.927
- Bye, peanut!
- <i>Feel better!</i>

00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:52.295
<i>Feel better, buddy!</i>

00:48:52.297 --> 00:48:55.135
I'm sorry.
It said emergency.

00:48:55.137 --> 00:48:56.972
Ava, I want to help you.

00:48:56.974 --> 00:48:59.142
She doesn't need your help.
I know how to save her.

00:48:59.144 --> 00:49:00.311
Oh, really? How?

00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:01.949
Janet.

00:49:01.951 --> 00:49:03.217
For the last 30 years,
she's been down there

00:49:03.219 --> 00:49:04.353
absorbing quantum energy.

00:49:04.355 --> 00:49:06.090
We can extract that energy.

00:49:06.092 --> 00:49:08.193
We can use it to repair
Ava's molecular structure...

00:49:08.195 --> 00:49:09.362
Extract it?

00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:10.432
- Yes.
- Are you insane?

00:49:10.434 --> 00:49:12.369
That would rip Janet apart.

00:49:12.371 --> 00:49:15.340
You don't know that.
I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.

00:49:15.342 --> 00:49:16.679
When Janet's location

00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:18.048
pops into Lang's head,
he's gonna give it to me...

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.717
or I'm gonna turn him over
to the FBI.

00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:21.054
What?

00:49:21.056 --> 00:49:22.990
You are gonna stay here...

00:49:22.992 --> 00:49:24.594
just in case I need your help.

00:49:25.965 --> 00:49:27.498
Like hell I would help you!

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.635
You'll do whatever I say.

00:49:28.637 --> 00:49:30.037
You're gonna kill Janet!

00:49:30.039 --> 00:49:32.041
I'd be more worried
about yourself, Hank.

00:49:32.043 --> 00:49:34.981
Goddamn it, Bill!

00:49:34.983 --> 00:49:36.218
- Dad?
- Calm down, Hank.

00:49:37.054 --> 00:49:38.122
So help me God...

00:49:39.025 --> 00:49:40.191
The pills.

00:49:40.193 --> 00:49:42.061
It's his heart!
He needs his pills.

00:49:42.063 --> 00:49:44.534
Please, Dr. Foster.
They're in the tin. Please.

00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:47.405
He could die!

00:49:47.407 --> 00:49:48.474
Come on!

00:49:48.476 --> 00:49:50.077
Help him!

00:49:50.079 --> 00:49:51.514
Dad, just hang on, all right?

00:49:51.516 --> 00:49:52.782
Just keep breathing.
Stay calm.

00:49:52.784 --> 00:49:54.320
Help him, man! Come on!

00:49:54.322 --> 00:49:55.322
The Altoid tin!

00:49:57.293 --> 00:49:58.295
Wait!

00:50:02.538 --> 00:50:03.539
Thanks, guys.

00:50:04.474 --> 00:50:05.509
Hank!

00:50:17.601 --> 00:50:20.405
Bill is filling
that girl's head with lies.

00:50:20.407 --> 00:50:24.079
Elihas Starr was a traitor.
He stole my plans.

00:50:24.081 --> 00:50:26.316
Now, bring it down.
All right, lock it in.

00:50:26.318 --> 00:50:29.222
No, no, no.
The bolt is on the other side.

00:50:29.224 --> 00:50:31.693
Tighten that one down,
then bring it down one notch.

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:32.697
Good job.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.333
It'll work.

00:50:34.335 --> 00:50:36.670
Foster, he could have fried
the entire system.

00:50:36.672 --> 00:50:38.106
Look, we'll adjust the relays

00:50:38.108 --> 00:50:39.675
while you go reprogram
the settings, all right?

00:50:39.677 --> 00:50:41.279
It's going to be fine.

00:50:47.393 --> 00:50:48.561
So, this is it.

00:50:48.563 --> 00:50:50.599
Yeah. You'd think
with all this time

00:50:50.601 --> 00:50:52.300
to prepare I'd be more ready.

00:50:52.302 --> 00:50:55.407
Oh, going subatomic isn't
something you can prepare for.

00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:57.746
It kind of melts your mind.

00:50:57.748 --> 00:50:59.585
I mean seeing my mom again.

00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:00.851
Oh.

00:51:02.757 --> 00:51:05.159
What if she's a completely
different person?

00:51:05.161 --> 00:51:07.565
Yeah, like, uh,
George Washington.

00:51:07.567 --> 00:51:08.735
I'm serious, Scott.

00:51:09.436 --> 00:51:11.107
Or George Jefferson.

00:51:12.945 --> 00:51:14.782
What if she's forgotten
about me?

00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:18.586
When I was in prison...

00:51:18.588 --> 00:51:21.291
the only thing that got me
through was Cassie.

00:51:21.293 --> 00:51:22.729
I could have been locked up
for 100 years...

00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:24.011
I never would have
forgotten her.

00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:28.438
I know your mom
is counting the minutes

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.177
until she can see you again.

00:51:31.782 --> 00:51:32.782
Thank you.

00:51:40.298 --> 00:51:41.633
Hey.

00:51:41.635 --> 00:51:42.735
We got a big problem.

00:51:42.737 --> 00:51:43.804
You forgot
the motion sensor lights

00:51:43.806 --> 00:51:44.940
on the back of the building.

00:51:44.942 --> 00:51:46.742
Oh, no.

00:51:46.744 --> 00:51:48.347
And they're on the proposal,

00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:49.816
and Karapetyan
asked for them specifically.

00:51:49.818 --> 00:51:54.325
Uh, yeah, look,
it's been a little crazy.

00:51:54.327 --> 00:51:55.927
Look, maybe I could stop by
tomorrow, take a look at it.

00:51:55.929 --> 00:51:56.896
No. No, no, no, no.

00:51:56.898 --> 00:51:58.532
The meeting is first thing
in the morning.

00:51:58.534 --> 00:51:59.936
You gotta come right now
and fix it.

00:51:59.938 --> 00:52:02.307
I can't. I wish I could,
but I can't leave.

00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:03.376
You know what,
I'm coming to you.

00:52:03.378 --> 00:52:05.847
I'll just bring the plans.
They're on the laptop.

00:52:05.849 --> 00:52:07.418
And you can fix them there.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.619
Just tell me
where you are, okay?

00:52:08.621 --> 00:52:09.789
It's complicated.

00:52:09.791 --> 00:52:11.111
What do you mean
it's complicated?

00:52:15.369 --> 00:52:17.505
As you can see, sir,

00:52:17.507 --> 00:52:19.708
this system is state of the art.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:21.945
Security of tomorrow, today.

00:52:21.947 --> 00:52:23.383
Oh, that's so good!

00:52:23.385 --> 00:52:24.851
And I love the lean-in, bro.
Keep practicin'.

00:52:24.853 --> 00:52:25.987
Hey, I just gotta
drive up to Scotty's,

00:52:25.989 --> 00:52:27.057
so we can fix the plans.

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:28.860
But don't worry, I'll be back
in plenty of time.

00:52:28.862 --> 00:52:31.932
- As you can see...
- Oh, oh, oh!

00:52:31.934 --> 00:52:33.737
Tell me you got the van washed
for tomorrow morning.

00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:35.441
Down to the undercarriage, baby.

00:52:35.443 --> 00:52:36.775
You sprung
for the undercarriage wash?

00:52:36.777 --> 00:52:38.546
Well, you said get the works.

00:52:38.548 --> 00:52:40.583
That's a scam, bro. We live
in California, not Minnesota.

00:52:40.585 --> 00:52:41.585
He's right.

00:52:42.523 --> 00:52:44.726
The undercarriage wash,

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.394
that's for cleaning
off road salt...

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:49.769
laid down in our
more snow-laden sister states.

00:52:49.771 --> 00:52:50.838
Who are you,
and why do you know so much

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.841
about car wash protocol?

00:52:52.976 --> 00:52:54.711
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.

00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:57.018
And I do my research, Luis.

00:52:58.655 --> 00:53:01.927
To wit, I have learned
from a friend of mine...

00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.829
at the FBI that you are

00:53:03.831 --> 00:53:05.633
a known associate
of Scott Lang...

00:53:05.635 --> 00:53:08.773
a known associate of Hank Pym,
who I've also learned...

00:53:08.775 --> 00:53:11.577
has a portable
shrinking laboratory...

00:53:11.579 --> 00:53:13.916
filled with
all kinds of juicy tech.

00:53:13.918 --> 00:53:16.856
And you're gonna tell me
where it is.

00:53:16.858 --> 00:53:18.492
Well, I hate to break it to you,

00:53:18.494 --> 00:53:21.063
but I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:53:21.065 --> 00:53:23.903
Well, I sense a resistance
in you, Luis.

00:53:23.905 --> 00:53:26.943
And I have promised results
to some dangerous people.

00:53:26.945 --> 00:53:30.585
So, I'm gonna introduce you
to my good friend, Uzman.

00:53:31.619 --> 00:53:33.488
Now...

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.226
Uzman is a master

00:53:35.228 --> 00:53:37.630
at extracting information
from the unwilling...

00:53:37.632 --> 00:53:38.900
through psychoactive means.

00:53:40.905 --> 00:53:43.007
Oh, is that truth serum?

00:53:43.009 --> 00:53:44.979
There's no such thing
as truth serum.

00:53:44.981 --> 00:53:46.682
That's just nonsense from TV.

00:53:46.684 --> 00:53:48.485
Well, what is it then?

00:53:48.487 --> 00:53:50.155
It's a little concoction

00:53:50.157 --> 00:53:52.961
that he's been perfecting
since his days with the S.I.S.

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:55.867
It makes you suggestible
and highly responsive.

00:53:55.869 --> 00:53:56.735
Well, dude, that's truth serum.

00:53:56.737 --> 00:53:58.104
No, it's not.

00:53:58.106 --> 00:54:01.077
No offensing, but they sound
like truth serum to me.

00:54:01.079 --> 00:54:03.282
- Right?
- It's not a truth serum.

00:54:03.284 --> 00:54:04.985
Okay. Hey, I believe you.

00:54:04.987 --> 00:54:06.021
It's not a truth serum.

00:54:06.023 --> 00:54:09.626
I mean, if it walk like duck
and talk like ducks...

00:54:09.628 --> 00:54:11.030
The truth serum.

00:54:11.032 --> 00:54:12.967
Well, I have
a lot of allergies...

00:54:12.969 --> 00:54:14.606
so you might wanna think
about that.

00:54:17.811 --> 00:54:19.548
We've got to get that lab back.

00:54:20.284 --> 00:54:22.686
What?

00:54:22.688 --> 00:54:24.824
The chamber and the suit
are barely helping anymore.

00:54:26.664 --> 00:54:27.999
How long have I got?

00:54:31.706 --> 00:54:33.108
A couple of weeks, maybe.

00:54:35.648 --> 00:54:37.782
Well, then we'll make them
bring the lab back.

00:54:37.784 --> 00:54:38.786
How?

00:54:39.956 --> 00:54:42.360
Lang. He has
a daughter, right?

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:43.362
You can't mean that.

00:54:43.364 --> 00:54:44.965
Ava!

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:49.106
I tolerate a lot of the things
you do out there...

00:54:49.108 --> 00:54:50.828
but I won't be a part
of anything like that.

00:54:51.646 --> 00:54:52.746
You're not the one who's about

00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:54.284
to fade away into nothing, Bill.

00:54:54.286 --> 00:54:55.320
I am!

00:54:56.222 --> 00:54:57.992
You said you could fix me!

00:55:00.766 --> 00:55:02.700
You promised.

00:55:02.702 --> 00:55:04.704
I know. I will.

00:55:04.706 --> 00:55:06.008
But not like that.

00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:11.083
You lay one finger
on that little girl...

00:55:11.085 --> 00:55:13.356
I won't help you.
And we're done.

00:55:19.034 --> 00:55:20.804
Fine.

00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:23.744
There are other options.

00:55:37.739 --> 00:55:39.941
You know what? You're right.
This isn't truth serum.

00:55:39.943 --> 00:55:41.342
Because I don't feel anything.

00:55:41.344 --> 00:55:43.081
That was a lie.
I do feel something.

00:55:43.083 --> 00:55:44.217
This is truth serum!

00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:45.385
There's no such thing!

00:55:45.387 --> 00:55:47.088
Okay.

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:49.425
Okay, okay.

00:55:49.427 --> 00:55:51.898
Now, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you, Luis.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:53.102
Okay.

00:55:55.371 --> 00:55:59.045
Where is Scott Lang?

00:55:59.047 --> 00:56:00.215
Well, see, that's complicated.

00:56:00.217 --> 00:56:02.284
Because when I first met
Scotty, he was in a bad place.

00:56:02.286 --> 00:56:03.688
<i>And I'm not talkin'
about cell block D.</i>

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:05.023
<i>His wife had just filed for
divorce, and I was, like...</i>

00:56:05.025 --> 00:56:07.362
<i>"Damn, homie. She dumped you
when you're on lockup?"</i>

00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:08.597
<i>And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.</i>

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:09.300
<i>"I thought I was gonna be
with her forever...</i>

00:56:09.302 --> 00:56:10.235
<i>"but now I'm all alone."</i>

00:56:10.237 --> 00:56:12.805
<i>And I was, like, "Damn, homie.
You know what?</i>

00:56:12.807 --> 00:56:13.474
<i>"You gotta chin up, because
you'll find a new partner.</i>

00:56:13.476 --> 00:56:14.610
<i>"But you know what? I'm Luis."</i>

00:56:14.612 --> 00:56:15.644
<i>And he says,
"You know what? I'm Scotty,</i>

00:56:15.646 --> 00:56:16.347
<i>"and we're gonna be
best friends."</i>

00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:18.418
Okay, hold on, hold on.

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:20.121
I like a good story
as much as the next person...

00:56:20.123 --> 00:56:21.123
but what in the hell
does this have to do

00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:22.325
with where Scott Lang is?

00:56:22.327 --> 00:56:23.494
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

00:56:23.496 --> 00:56:25.030
You put a dime in him,

00:56:25.032 --> 00:56:26.233
you gotta let the whole song
play out.

00:56:26.235 --> 00:56:28.304
He like human jukebox.

00:56:28.306 --> 00:56:29.940
Oh, my <i>abuelita</i> had a jukebox
in the restaurant!

00:56:29.942 --> 00:56:31.141
<i>Yeah, only played Morrissey.</i>

00:56:32.414 --> 00:56:34.294
<i>And if anybody ever
complained, she'd be like...</i>

00:56:35.186 --> 00:56:36.586
<i>You know, Chicanos,
we call him "Moz."</i>

00:56:36.588 --> 00:56:37.923
<i>Then</i>, ¡adios!

00:56:37.925 --> 00:56:39.191
What can I say?
We relate to his

00:56:39.193 --> 00:56:40.894
melancholy ballads, you know?

00:56:40.896 --> 00:56:42.130
- Lang!
- Right, right, right.

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:43.166
So, anyway,
Scotty gets out of jail,

00:56:43.168 --> 00:56:44.436
and he starts working for Hank.

00:56:44.438 --> 00:56:45.369
<i>That's when he met Hope.
And Hope's all, like...</i>

00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:47.309
<i>"I want nothing to do with you.</i>

00:56:47.311 --> 00:56:49.045
<i>"Look at my hairdo,
I'm all business."</i>

00:56:49.047 --> 00:56:50.280
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

00:56:50.282 --> 00:56:51.349
<i>"You know what, girl?
My heart is all broken.</i>

00:56:51.351 --> 00:56:52.385
<i>"And I'll probably
never find love again,</i>

00:56:52.387 --> 00:56:53.119
<i>"but damn
if I want to kiss you!"</i>

00:56:53.121 --> 00:56:55.191
<i>But then you fast forward</i>

00:56:55.193 --> 00:56:55.891
<i>and they're all
into each other, right?</i>

00:56:55.893 --> 00:56:57.028
<i>And then Scotty's, like,</i>

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.162
<i>"You know what?
I can't tell you this...</i>

00:56:58.164 --> 00:57:00.568
<i>"but I'm gonna go trash an
airport with Captain America."</i>

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:02.104
<i>And then she said, "I can't
believe you split like that!</i>

00:57:02.106 --> 00:57:03.541
<i>"Smell you later, dummy."</i>

00:57:03.543 --> 00:57:04.876
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.

00:57:04.878 --> 00:57:05.878
<i>And he won't admit it,
but his heart is all, like...</i>

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.115
<i>"Damn! I thought
Hope coulda been</i>

00:57:08.117 --> 00:57:10.052
<i>"my new true partner,
but I blew it!"</i>

00:57:10.054 --> 00:57:11.188
<i>But fate brought 'em
back together.</i>

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.291
And then Hope's heart is all...

00:57:12.293 --> 00:57:13.628
<i>"I'm worried
that I can't trust him...</i>

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.664
<i>"and he's gonna screw up
again, and ruin everything!"</i>

00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:16.833
And then
my heart is all, like...

00:57:16.835 --> 00:57:19.070
<i>"That fancy raspberry filling
represents the company's red</i>

00:57:19.072 --> 00:57:20.641
<i>"and we're days away from
going out of business. Oh!"</i>

00:57:20.643 --> 00:57:21.508
"Out of business"?

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:22.646
"Days away"?

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:24.215
Damn truth serum!

00:57:24.217 --> 00:57:26.286
I was trying to protect
you guys. I swear to God.

00:57:26.288 --> 00:57:28.222
I was trying to be
a good boss, but we're broke!

00:57:28.224 --> 00:57:29.025
And the Karapetyan's
our last hope.

00:57:29.027 --> 00:57:30.226
And if we don't show up,
we're done!

00:57:30.228 --> 00:57:31.396
That's terrible bossing!

00:57:31.398 --> 00:57:32.563
Damn, bro!

00:57:32.565 --> 00:57:33.965
- That's on me! That's on me!
- Hey!

00:57:34.503 --> 00:57:36.340
Enough.

00:57:38.646 --> 00:57:40.316
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

00:57:41.717 --> 00:57:43.253
Where is Scott Lang?

00:57:43.255 --> 00:57:44.255
I've been trying to tell you,

00:57:44.257 --> 00:57:45.523
he's in a tricky spot,
emotionally speaking.

00:57:45.525 --> 00:57:47.226
Emotionally speaking.

00:57:47.228 --> 00:57:50.233
Well, where is Scott Lang,
literally speaking!

00:57:50.235 --> 00:57:51.670
Oh! The woods.

00:57:51.672 --> 00:57:52.672
The woods?

00:57:53.108 --> 00:57:54.210
Baba Yaga!

00:57:55.445 --> 00:57:57.280
What do you mean, "the woods"?

00:57:57.282 --> 00:57:58.450
The Muir Woods,
the second fire road

00:57:58.452 --> 00:57:59.753
off the Panoramic Highway!

00:57:59.755 --> 00:58:01.222
For God's sake!

00:58:03.061 --> 00:58:04.729
<i>♪ Baba Yaga,
come at night</i>

00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.969
<i>♪ Little children,
sleepy tight ♪</i>

00:58:09.239 --> 00:58:10.675
Damn it!

00:58:12.545 --> 00:58:14.081
If that freak gets Pym's tech...

00:58:14.083 --> 00:58:15.784
I'm never gonna see it.

00:58:15.786 --> 00:58:16.786
So, what do we do now?

00:58:18.259 --> 00:58:19.758
It's easier to steal it
from the Feds

00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.295
than from the boogeyman.

00:58:23.802 --> 00:58:27.273
Hey, it's me. How'd you like
to get a promotion?

00:58:27.275 --> 00:58:31.148
I got the location on Pym,
Van Dyne and Lang.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.284
But you gonna
have to take 'em down now,

00:58:32.286 --> 00:58:34.387
because they ain't gonna
be there for long.

00:58:34.389 --> 00:58:36.259
And when you do,
you gonna get me that lab.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.364
Understood.

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:41.501
Good news, gentlemen.

00:58:41.503 --> 00:58:44.340
Feds are gonna do
the hard work for us.

00:58:44.342 --> 00:58:46.278
What are you lookin' at?
Change my tires!

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.282
Right.

00:58:49.454 --> 00:58:52.557
- Sir.
- Can you knock?

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:55.030
Sorry, sir.
Uh, but I just got a lead.

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.170
Ooh, I love leads.

00:59:04.815 --> 00:59:06.150
System's in the green.

00:59:06.152 --> 00:59:07.554
Priming the coils.

00:59:10.128 --> 00:59:11.327
Full charge.

00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:12.498
As soon as the tunnel's open...

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.633
let us know if you get anything

00:59:13.635 --> 00:59:14.802
that could be
a part of her message.

00:59:14.804 --> 00:59:16.139
Yeah, yeah. I will.

00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:19.612
Okay, then.

00:59:22.418 --> 00:59:23.420
Here it goes.

00:59:37.315 --> 00:59:38.684
We did it!

00:59:39.418 --> 00:59:40.753
You got anything?

00:59:43.862 --> 00:59:45.563
Nothin'.

00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:47.768
Well, just give it a minute,
because it could...

00:59:49.271 --> 00:59:50.807
No.

00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:52.409
No, no, no, no!

00:59:52.411 --> 00:59:53.445
What's happening?

00:59:53.447 --> 00:59:55.648
It's shutting down.
Maybe our vectors are off.

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.854
We've gone over them a million
times, I know they're right!

00:59:57.856 --> 00:59:59.224
Then what else could it be?

00:59:59.226 --> 01:00:00.628
I don't know!

01:00:06.807 --> 01:00:08.273
- Scott, what are you doing?
- Scott, get away from that!

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.644
Scott, you can't...

01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:11.280
I'm sorry, I don't know
how much time I have.

01:00:11.282 --> 01:00:12.485
I need to fix the algorithm.

01:00:14.722 --> 01:00:16.992
Trust me,
after 30 years down here...

01:00:16.994 --> 01:00:18.664
I've thought about it a lot.

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:24.375
Janet?

01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:28.416
Hi, honey.

01:00:31.891 --> 01:00:33.561
Jellybean.

01:00:33.927 --> 01:00:35.330
Mom?

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:37.932
It's not the reunion
I'd imagined.

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.072
It's all so rushed.

01:00:40.074 --> 01:00:42.510
You two have done
such great work.

01:00:42.512 --> 01:00:44.481
You just need a little...

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.018
nudge.

01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:03.720
Janet, how is this possible?

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.958
It wasn't a message you put

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.461
in Scott's head.
It was an antenna.

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:10.465
Clever girl.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.670
I'm so proud of you.

01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:14.541
Honey, tell us where you are.

01:01:14.543 --> 01:01:16.510
Tell us how to find you.

01:01:16.512 --> 01:01:18.514
No, the probability fields
are too complex.

01:01:18.516 --> 01:01:19.816
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

01:01:19.818 --> 01:01:21.054
You have to follow my voice.

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:22.923
Of course!

01:01:22.925 --> 01:01:24.595
Like tracing a call
back to its source!

01:01:29.938 --> 01:01:33.043
I'm tracking your signal
using subatomic frequencies...

01:01:33.045 --> 01:01:35.449
between point two
and point nine.

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:37.151
I'd narrow it to four and six.

01:01:37.153 --> 01:01:38.454
That's too tight.
We could miss you.

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:39.826
Look at us squabbling again.

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:43.865
Fine. All right,
between three and seven.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.972
Our first fight in decades,
and it's over just like that.

01:02:01.534 --> 01:02:03.137
Bullseye.

01:02:03.773 --> 01:02:05.041
Source lock.

01:02:05.043 --> 01:02:07.010
It's you.

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:09.782
We got it!

01:02:09.784 --> 01:02:11.854
You have to meet me
at these exact coordinates.

01:02:11.856 --> 01:02:14.525
In the wasteland,
beyond the quantum void.

01:02:14.527 --> 01:02:15.760
It's very dangerous,

01:02:15.762 --> 01:02:17.967
especially on the human mind,
so be careful.

01:02:17.969 --> 01:02:20.670
Time and space work very
differently down here.

01:02:20.672 --> 01:02:22.208
You have two hours.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:24.012
After that, the probability
fields will shift...

01:02:24.014 --> 01:02:25.081
and it'll be another century

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:26.717
before they align
like this again.

01:02:26.719 --> 01:02:28.522
We'll find you.

01:02:35.068 --> 01:02:37.574
I know you will, Jellybean.

01:02:41.983 --> 01:02:43.784
Nope.

01:02:43.786 --> 01:02:45.789
Nothing. I got nothing.
No sign of Janet.

01:02:45.791 --> 01:02:46.791
Perfect.

01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:50.097
How did we get up here?

01:02:55.242 --> 01:02:57.077
All right, first you're gonna
see all kinds of lights...

01:02:57.079 --> 01:02:58.280
and it's gonna get
really trippy...

01:02:58.282 --> 01:03:01.052
but then it's gonna turn black
and silent. Really silent.

01:03:01.054 --> 01:03:03.123
Scott, I'll be fine.

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.325
I'm just saying
because I've been down there.

01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:05.927
Yeah, so you've mentioned.

01:03:08.969 --> 01:03:10.705
Um, sorry.
I have to take this.

01:03:12.141 --> 01:03:13.644
<i>Hey, man, you coming?</i>

01:03:13.646 --> 01:03:15.615
No, I'm not,
but you know what? Ghost is.

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:17.651
And you know what? The Feds,
they know where you are.

01:03:17.653 --> 01:03:19.088
- What?
- <i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.090
Uh, they gave me
some truth serum.

01:03:20.092 --> 01:03:21.392
And then all of a sudden

01:03:21.394 --> 01:03:22.494
I started talkin' all honestly.

01:03:22.496 --> 01:03:24.398
Like, I hate the way
that you load the dishwasher.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.300
<i>I hate it, I hate it.</i>

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.336
- Uh...
- <i>But you need to go home...</i>

01:03:26.338 --> 01:03:28.106
because the Feds
are probably going there now!

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:29.309
And by the way...

01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:31.914
who puts the plates on the top
rack? They don't go there!

01:03:41.702 --> 01:03:43.269
I feel like such a jerk.

01:03:43.271 --> 01:03:45.675
You're gonna be really mad.
We gotta go now.

01:03:45.677 --> 01:03:46.842
What?

01:03:46.844 --> 01:03:48.847
Ghost knows where we are.
So does the FBI.

01:03:48.849 --> 01:03:50.316
How?

01:03:50.318 --> 01:03:52.421
- I told Luis where we are.
- You what?

01:03:52.423 --> 01:03:53.090
I told him to come here
so I could help him

01:03:53.092 --> 01:03:54.793
with the Karapetyan proposal.

01:03:54.795 --> 01:03:56.463
Oh, my God!

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.999
Look, we need
to land that account.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.267
Otherwise, we lose the business!

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:00.170
Do you know hard it is
for ex-cons

01:04:00.172 --> 01:04:01.271
to find work these days?

01:04:01.273 --> 01:04:02.643
Jesus, Scott!

01:04:12.429 --> 01:04:13.996
90 seconds to close
the aperture!

01:04:13.998 --> 01:04:15.767
You have to depolarize
the coils first!

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:16.936
I know!

01:04:16.938 --> 01:04:19.208
I'm really sorry...

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:21.912
but the, um, FBI
is coming to my place so...

01:04:21.914 --> 01:04:23.183
I have to go.

01:04:25.155 --> 01:04:26.826
Can I borrow the suit?

01:04:28.193 --> 01:04:29.697
<i>Gyroscopic stabilizers.</i>

01:04:30.097 --> 01:04:31.766
<i>Powering on.</i>

01:04:31.768 --> 01:04:34.104
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.

01:04:34.106 --> 01:04:36.242
I'll come back.
Just tell me where you'll be.

01:04:36.244 --> 01:04:37.943
- Don't bother.
- What?

01:04:37.945 --> 01:04:39.115
We'll come
and get the suit from you,

01:04:39.117 --> 01:04:40.383
as soon as we've found my mom.

01:04:40.385 --> 01:04:42.355
- Hope...
- Scott, just go!

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:01.927
- Scott?
- Daddy?

01:05:01.929 --> 01:05:03.162
It's us, buddy!

01:05:03.164 --> 01:05:05.566
We're here for Cassie's shoes!

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.070
He must be resting.

01:05:07.072 --> 01:05:08.238
Honey, why don't you go upstairs

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.307
and look under your bed?

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:11.478
Daddy, you upstairs?

01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:14.050
Daddy?

01:05:15.255 --> 01:05:16.257
What the...

01:05:17.925 --> 01:05:20.028
He really lives
like a pig these days.

01:05:23.237 --> 01:05:24.405
Daddy?

01:05:32.121 --> 01:05:34.123
Spread out!

01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:35.293
Again?

01:05:35.295 --> 01:05:37.095
You people have no shame!

01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:38.532
The monitor says
that he's in the bathroom.

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:39.536
Yeah, I'm not buying it!

01:05:42.509 --> 01:05:44.411
Cassie, let the man get by!

01:05:44.413 --> 01:05:46.280
But Daddy's super sick!

01:05:46.282 --> 01:05:47.650
I'll see about that!

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.521
He says he doesn't want
anyone else to get sick!

01:05:49.523 --> 01:05:51.258
I'll take my chances, sweetie.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.496
He barfed. Like, a lot.

01:05:53.498 --> 01:05:55.132
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.

01:05:55.134 --> 01:05:56.936
I've seen worse things
than vomit.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.106
Like, "a lot" a lot?

01:05:59.108 --> 01:06:00.611
- Yes!
- Forget it, move aside!

01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:02.211
No!

01:06:05.422 --> 01:06:07.557
Woo!

01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:11.298
- What are you doing here?
- Scott.

01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:15.673
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.

01:06:15.675 --> 01:06:16.977
I told you.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:18.612
Excuse me.

01:06:18.614 --> 01:06:21.050
Sometimes you gotta just
get it out. You know?

01:06:21.052 --> 01:06:22.753
Sorry.

01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:30.735
I'll start the van.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.674
You get the lab.

01:06:35.547 --> 01:06:37.217
Freeze!
You're surrounded!

01:06:51.246 --> 01:06:53.115
Hank Pym...

01:06:53.117 --> 01:06:54.516
Hope Van Dyne...

01:06:54.518 --> 01:06:55.686
you're under arrest.

01:06:57.557 --> 01:06:58.724
This is harassment!

01:06:58.726 --> 01:07:00.229
Actually, it's not.

01:07:00.231 --> 01:07:01.664
What does the FBI
even stand for...

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:04.037
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?

01:07:05.706 --> 01:07:07.543
- His monitor check out?
- Of course it does.

01:07:08.179 --> 01:07:09.746
Damn it!

01:07:09.748 --> 01:07:12.286
Looks like I just got fed
a bowl of malarkey.

01:07:12.288 --> 01:07:14.190
We got 'em sir. Pym
and Van Dyne are in custody.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.529
Seriously? Yes!

01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:19.867
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.469
They're your friends.
That's insensitive.

01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:24.309
I just really needed a win,
you know?

01:07:24.311 --> 01:07:25.744
Anyway, I'll be back later

01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:27.583
for the official end
of your sentence!

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:29.286
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!

01:07:29.288 --> 01:07:31.125
You should feel great
about yourself!

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:56.307
What is it?

01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:57.476
We have a man down.

01:07:57.478 --> 01:07:58.847
And Pym's lab is gone.

01:08:07.297 --> 01:08:08.298
Hey.

01:08:10.369 --> 01:08:12.271
Thanks for covering for me.

01:08:12.273 --> 01:08:13.273
Sure.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.817
So...

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:20.423
how long
have you been Ant-Man again?

01:08:24.398 --> 01:08:25.831
Not long.

01:08:25.833 --> 01:08:27.669
It just sort of happened.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:29.706
I'm sorry for lying to you...

01:08:29.708 --> 01:08:31.509
and I'm sorry
for risking everything.

01:08:31.511 --> 01:08:32.478
Daddy, it's okay.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.615
It's not.

01:08:34.618 --> 01:08:36.352
I do some dumb things...

01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:38.625
and the people that I love
the most pay the price.

01:08:38.627 --> 01:08:39.793
Mainly you.

01:08:39.795 --> 01:08:42.330
Trying to help people
isn't dumb.

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:46.874
I screw it up
just about every time.

01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:50.280
So, maybe you just need
someone watching your back...

01:08:50.282 --> 01:08:51.583
like a partner.

01:08:51.585 --> 01:08:52.486
Well, she's made it clear

01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:53.987
that's about the last thing
she wants.

01:08:53.989 --> 01:08:55.290
Who?

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:56.560
Hope.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.366
Wait, who did you think?

01:09:00.368 --> 01:09:01.371
Me.

01:09:01.838 --> 01:09:03.339
You?

01:09:03.341 --> 01:09:05.311
Don't laugh.

01:09:05.313 --> 01:09:06.545
I'd be a great partner.

01:09:06.547 --> 01:09:08.616
Aw, peanut.

01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:12.892
Aw. You would be awesome.
And if I let you...

01:09:12.894 --> 01:09:14.930
I would be a terrible dad.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:16.967
Fine.

01:09:16.969 --> 01:09:19.640
Then have Hope be
your partner. She's smart.

01:09:21.511 --> 01:09:22.847
She reminds me of you.

01:09:23.548 --> 01:09:25.884
You gonna go help her?

01:09:25.886 --> 01:09:27.856
I think you should help her.

01:09:27.858 --> 01:09:30.893
I wish I could...

01:09:30.895 --> 01:09:33.567
but I don't know how I could
help her without hurting you.

01:09:36.908 --> 01:09:38.843
You can do it.

01:09:38.845 --> 01:09:41.449
You can do anything.

01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:44.388
You are the world's
greatest grandma.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.772
Agent Woo will see you
in an hour.

01:09:53.774 --> 01:09:55.910
An hour?
We don't have an hour.

01:09:55.912 --> 01:09:57.981
Oh, you got
somewhere else to be?

01:10:05.832 --> 01:10:08.036
Oh, now, that's my girl.

01:10:14.684 --> 01:10:16.588
All right, what's our plan?

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:20.527
To shrink that wall.

01:10:20.529 --> 01:10:21.696
It looks load-bearing.

01:10:21.698 --> 01:10:22.865
The ceiling could collapse.

01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:24.701
Then we run like hell.

01:10:24.703 --> 01:10:27.072
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents
on the floor.

01:10:27.074 --> 01:10:28.876
Roughly five times that
in the building at large.

01:10:28.878 --> 01:10:30.513
They're all heavily armed.

01:10:30.515 --> 01:10:31.515
Not great odds.

01:10:32.152 --> 01:10:33.251
You got any better ideas?

01:10:33.253 --> 01:10:34.456
Nope.

01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.794
And I'm not giving up on Mom.

01:10:37.796 --> 01:10:39.131
She'd be so proud of you.

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:45.745
Okay.

01:10:47.048 --> 01:10:48.051
One...

01:10:48.685 --> 01:10:49.687
two...

01:10:54.863 --> 01:10:56.298
Scott?

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.835
What're you two
just standing around for?

01:10:57.837 --> 01:10:59.105
We gotta go find that lab.

01:11:00.074 --> 01:11:01.077
What about me?

01:11:02.612 --> 01:11:04.179
Perfect.

01:11:04.181 --> 01:11:06.141
Hurry up and get dressed.
We don't have much time.

01:11:19.179 --> 01:11:20.680
Okay, now what?

01:11:20.682 --> 01:11:22.051
You're asking me?

01:11:24.855 --> 01:11:26.024
Get in!

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:32.171
Hi.

01:11:32.972 --> 01:11:33.974
Hi.

01:11:36.948 --> 01:11:40.117
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning
on leaving soon...

01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:42.055
or are you two gonna keep
staring at each other...

01:11:42.057 --> 01:11:44.294
until they start shooting at us?

01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:45.698
Yeah.

01:11:50.675 --> 01:11:51.875
- Hey, Burch.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:11:51.877 --> 01:11:53.044
Yeah, they're out.

01:11:53.046 --> 01:11:54.181
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:11:59.192 --> 01:12:00.759
Her suit is missing,
and so is the van.

01:12:00.761 --> 01:12:02.062
How could this happen?

01:12:02.064 --> 01:12:03.767
I mean, what the dickens?

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.373
Thank you.

01:12:08.677 --> 01:12:09.677
You're welcome.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.053
So, uh, how do we find the lab?

01:12:14.055 --> 01:12:15.254
After we lost it
the first time...

01:12:15.256 --> 01:12:18.227
I put on a new tracker...

01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:19.899
of sorts.

01:12:28.949 --> 01:12:30.152
That'll work.

01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:59.308
Is it ready or not?

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:01.915
We can begin
the extraction process.

01:13:02.985 --> 01:13:04.152
Listen, Ava.

01:13:04.154 --> 01:13:05.858
This whole thing
could be very dangerous.

01:13:06.894 --> 01:13:08.027
Maybe we should...

01:13:08.029 --> 01:13:10.965
Maybe we should what? Wait?

01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:12.872
I've got days until I'm dead.

01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:16.379
We're doing this, Bill. Now.

01:13:19.851 --> 01:13:23.089
Energy readings show they
have not used the tunnel yet.

01:13:23.091 --> 01:13:24.159
We don't have much time before

01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:25.428
Mom's location shifts,
and we lose her.

01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:28.134
Yeah, and we have
a lot to do before then.

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:29.436
You know,
my pep-pep always said,

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.440
"If you want to do something
right, you make a list."

01:13:31.442 --> 01:13:32.976
So, we should do that.

01:13:32.978 --> 01:13:35.249
One, we have to break
into that lab.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.887
Two, we have to kick out
Foster and Ghost.

01:13:37.889 --> 01:13:40.191
Three, we're gonna
have to fight Ghost.

01:13:40.193 --> 01:13:42.595
That seems like it should be
part of two. 2-A, all right?

01:13:42.597 --> 01:13:44.299
Let's call it 2-A.

01:13:44.301 --> 01:13:46.001
Fight Ghost. 2-A.

01:13:46.003 --> 01:13:47.371
Oh, also, we have to make sure
that the lab

01:13:47.373 --> 01:13:48.909
is fully grown
for you to come back.

01:13:48.911 --> 01:13:49.610
Otherwise, we're screwed.

01:13:49.612 --> 01:13:51.112
Scott!

01:13:51.114 --> 01:13:52.014
You want me to start again?
I'll start again...

01:13:52.016 --> 01:13:53.519
I'm going to dive.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:57.994
The only chance we got is if
the two of you are out here...

01:13:57.996 --> 01:14:01.500
together, protecting the tunnel.

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:03.906
Let me do this, Hope. Please.

01:14:05.377 --> 01:14:07.280
Let me get her.

01:14:08.983 --> 01:14:10.519
I think he's right.

01:14:17.668 --> 01:14:20.038
"Whassup?"

01:14:22.377 --> 01:14:24.548
You don't remember, uh,
that beloved commercial?

01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:26.652
"Whassup?"

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.057
I had him follow us.

01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:32.529
I thought we could use
some help.

01:14:34.233 --> 01:14:35.601
All right.
I'm in position.

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:37.103
The ants are headed in.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.406
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:14:38.408 --> 01:14:39.608
<i>Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.</i>

01:14:40.112 --> 01:14:43.282
- Do you want Pez?
- No.

01:14:43.284 --> 01:14:45.254
Cassie gave me this
for my birthday.

01:14:45.256 --> 01:14:47.226
By the way, I love that suit!

01:14:47.694 --> 01:14:49.331
Thanks, man.

01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:52.568
I wish I had a suit.

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:57.076
I would even like a suit
with minimal powers, you know?

01:14:57.078 --> 01:15:00.351
Or maybe even just a suit,
with no powers.

01:15:15.349 --> 01:15:16.351
What is it?

01:15:17.252 --> 01:15:19.189
Don't know.

01:15:23.131 --> 01:15:24.199
It's them!

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:28.208
They can't be far.

01:15:49.182 --> 01:15:52.387
All right, Hank. Hank?

01:15:54.393 --> 01:15:56.195
Dad, what's your status?

01:15:56.197 --> 01:15:57.865
Foster's taken care of.

01:15:57.867 --> 01:15:59.436
Suiting up now.

01:16:04.146 --> 01:16:06.182
I just wanted to save Ava.

01:16:06.184 --> 01:16:08.785
She's facing death or
something far more terrible.

01:16:08.787 --> 01:16:09.787
She's afraid.

01:16:10.826 --> 01:16:13.729
I'll help you find a cure
when I get back.

01:16:13.731 --> 01:16:15.633
I promise.

01:16:15.635 --> 01:16:18.139
Together, we'll figure
something out.

01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:21.646
Good luck, Hank.

01:16:22.349 --> 01:16:24.684
Thanks, Bill.

01:16:24.686 --> 01:16:27.358
Now, I'm gonna need you
to step back.

01:16:44.595 --> 01:16:47.799
<i>Time remaining, 15 minutes.</i>

01:16:49.537 --> 01:16:50.936
<i>Hank's in, Scott.</i>

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:51.906
<i>Any sign of her?</i>

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:53.243
No, nothing yet.

01:16:59.289 --> 01:17:00.391
Ava!

01:17:03.296 --> 01:17:05.433
Call off the ants, Scott.

01:17:05.435 --> 01:17:06.435
Oh, boy!

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:31.518
Can I get a status report?

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.320
'Cause I got some
serious Ghost problems here!

01:17:36.496 --> 01:17:37.496
Ready to dive.

01:17:44.546 --> 01:17:46.680
- In case I don't make it...
- <i>Don't.</i>

01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:47.917
Don't say that.

01:17:48.654 --> 01:17:50.656
<i>I can't lose you, too.</i>

01:17:50.658 --> 01:17:51.658
I love you, Hope.

01:17:53.697 --> 01:17:55.700
Guys,
everything's bad over here.

01:18:11.832 --> 01:18:12.835
Now.

01:18:22.921 --> 01:18:24.558
Misdirection.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.925
One of the first things
they teach you

01:18:25.927 --> 01:18:28.099
at Online Close-up
Magic University.

01:18:30.069 --> 01:18:31.072
No!

01:18:34.679 --> 01:18:35.948
Plan worked.
We got it, Scotty!

01:18:37.185 --> 01:18:38.218
Meet us at the rendezvous point.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:39.821
Okay, on my way!

01:18:39.823 --> 01:18:40.823
Oh, no.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.000
Really?
This guy again?

01:18:47.002 --> 01:18:48.236
Who?

01:18:48.238 --> 01:18:50.442
I told you
our business wasn't over.

01:18:52.515 --> 01:18:53.548
Change of plans.

01:18:56.989 --> 01:18:57.992
Hang on.

01:19:07.545 --> 01:19:09.548
I want that lab, boys,
whatever it takes.

01:19:19.001 --> 01:19:20.002
Hold on.

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:36.000
That undercarriage is filthy!

01:19:36.002 --> 01:19:37.238
Oh, they got bigger problems.

01:19:42.782 --> 01:19:43.816
Hope, what're you doing?

01:19:43.818 --> 01:19:45.217
You're heading away
from the rendezvous point!

01:19:45.219 --> 01:19:46.385
<i>Don't worry,</i>

01:19:46.387 --> 01:19:47.822
<i>I'm taking these guys
on the scenic route.</i>

01:19:47.824 --> 01:19:49.694
Wait, what're you... Oh.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.572
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're gonna die!

01:20:12.106 --> 01:20:13.641
We're gonna die!

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.934
<i>Signal lost.</i>

01:20:27.936 --> 01:20:30.073
What the hell
are they doing up there?

01:20:32.881 --> 01:20:34.214
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:20:49.413 --> 01:20:51.184
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:56.159
You never said
it was so beautiful, Scott.

01:21:01.739 --> 01:21:02.907
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:21:06.849 --> 01:21:09.117
Okay, any time now.

01:21:09.119 --> 01:21:11.155
<i>Recalibrating.</i>

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:15.464
- <i>Recalibrating.</i>
- Come on.

01:21:16.435 --> 01:21:18.806
<i>Signal restored.</i>

01:21:31.798 --> 01:21:33.167
Bikes, it's all you.

01:21:37.109 --> 01:21:38.549
- Take the wheel.
- What? Wait! Whoa.

01:21:47.931 --> 01:21:51.969
Well, the 60's were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

01:21:51.971 --> 01:21:53.606
Be careful up there!

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:55.648
Hey, give me a break!
I haven't driven in two years!

01:22:25.171 --> 01:22:26.942
Oh, you got pezed!

01:22:29.078 --> 01:22:30.078
Up here!

01:22:33.354 --> 01:22:34.356
Oh, that's not good.

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:39.432
Hope!

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:46.110
- No!
- No!

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:52.590
There it is, right there.
Get the lab!

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:53.627
Get the lab!

01:23:03.012 --> 01:23:04.983
I've got her.
Westbound on Fremont.

01:23:07.588 --> 01:23:10.157
Hope! Wait!

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:11.461
Hey, what about me?

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.582
We got you now, Ava!

01:23:22.184 --> 01:23:24.620
Whoa! Oh!

01:23:48.203 --> 01:23:49.470
Not again!

01:23:51.242 --> 01:23:52.478
Piece of junk!

01:23:55.819 --> 01:23:57.321
Ah! Yes!

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:01.261
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.170
Burch got the lab.

01:24:05.704 --> 01:24:07.475
I'm going after him.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.762
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:22.704
Work in progress, my ass...

01:24:38.337 --> 01:24:39.370
<i>Scott, where are you?</i>

01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:40.940
<i>I've got Burch in my sights.
Hurry!</i>

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.409
I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:43.712
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

01:24:47.354 --> 01:24:49.623
<i>Warning,
approaching quantum void.</i>

01:25:14.975 --> 01:25:16.778
I'm coming to you, honey.

01:26:03.872 --> 01:26:05.507
Guys.

01:26:05.509 --> 01:26:08.714
Don't you need the remote
to the lab? I just found it.

01:26:08.716 --> 01:26:09.717
We can't grow
the lab without it.

01:26:09.719 --> 01:26:11.053
Get it to us fast.

01:26:11.055 --> 01:26:12.521
Yeah, but the van is busted.

01:26:12.523 --> 01:26:13.725
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.

01:26:16.666 --> 01:26:17.668
What?

01:26:23.078 --> 01:26:25.414
I love you, Dr. Pym.

01:26:25.416 --> 01:26:26.750
The remote!
We're missing the remote!

01:26:26.752 --> 01:26:27.752
<i>You gotta check the van!</i>

01:26:31.095 --> 01:26:32.095
Huh?

01:26:36.104 --> 01:26:37.104
Awesome!

01:27:04.462 --> 01:27:05.626
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.

01:27:05.628 --> 01:27:06.795
<i>Burch's boys are all over me.</i>

01:27:06.797 --> 01:27:08.066
I'm on my way.

01:27:08.068 --> 01:27:09.905
Right. I'll get the lab.

01:27:13.579 --> 01:27:14.581
Hi.

01:27:16.117 --> 01:27:17.117
Oh, that's badass!

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:27.071
Nice.

01:27:36.591 --> 01:27:37.591
Doink!

01:27:43.305 --> 01:27:44.972
Come here, you little weasel!

01:27:44.974 --> 01:27:46.677
No, you don't!

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:51.885
I guess maybe you do.

01:27:51.887 --> 01:27:53.990
Come on!

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:08.754
Anyone see a Southern
gentleman carrying a building?

01:28:12.896 --> 01:28:15.835
How'd he even have time
to buy a ticket?

01:28:15.837 --> 01:28:18.304
Would you just one time,

01:28:18.306 --> 01:28:19.675
please work!

01:28:20.645 --> 01:28:22.147
Yes!

01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:23.149
All right, I need help.

01:28:24.654 --> 01:28:25.654
Yes!

01:28:26.658 --> 01:28:28.761
Oh. Sorry. Ah...

01:28:29.396 --> 01:28:30.763
Somebody!

01:28:30.765 --> 01:28:32.100
Hey! Come on, man!

01:28:33.304 --> 01:28:35.005
Not cool!

01:28:35.007 --> 01:28:36.175
Murderers!

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:39.850
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:28:41.052 --> 01:28:44.157
I'm gonna call you
Ant-onio Banderas!

01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.295
You're a badass!

01:28:45.929 --> 01:28:47.729
Yes!

01:28:49.703 --> 01:28:51.138
No, no, no!

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:52.308
Ant-onio!

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.947
<i>Our friends, the humpbacks,</i>

01:28:56.949 --> 01:28:58.986
<i>dip in here
to the San Francisco Bay...</i>

01:28:58.988 --> 01:29:01.023
<i>for a little leisure
and a little breeding.</i>

01:29:01.025 --> 01:29:02.492
Listen, Uzman...

01:29:02.494 --> 01:29:04.964
<i>And perhaps they're down below
as we speak, doing the nasty.</i>

01:29:04.966 --> 01:29:06.436
Just meet me at the waterfront.

01:29:06.438 --> 01:29:07.571
In three hours.

01:29:07.573 --> 01:29:08.673
<i>Oh, folks.
We've barely left the dock...</i>

01:29:08.675 --> 01:29:10.878
<i>but it looks like
we got some company.</i>

01:29:14.019 --> 01:29:14.986
<i>Look. Right there.
Do you see it, folks?</i>

01:29:14.988 --> 01:29:17.157
<i>There it is.
There's a breach.</i>

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:19.897
What the...?

01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:27.876
Hi. Sorry. Hi.

01:29:27.878 --> 01:29:30.449
It's okay. It's okay!

01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:32.987
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale.
This will just take a second.

01:29:32.989 --> 01:29:35.259
Hey! That doesn't belong
to you!

01:29:35.261 --> 01:29:36.995
No, no! No, no!

01:29:36.997 --> 01:29:37.996
You're embarrassing yourself now

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:41.004
Come on. Let go.

01:29:41.006 --> 01:29:42.008
Thank you.

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:46.249
I'll take this now.

01:30:02.079 --> 01:30:03.248
<i>It melts your mind.</i>

01:30:05.319 --> 01:30:06.822
<i>A message in your head.</i>

01:30:09.127 --> 01:30:10.461
<i>I had a dream.</i>

01:30:10.463 --> 01:30:12.500
<i>Daddy?
Where's Mommy?</i>

01:30:12.502 --> 01:30:13.869
<i>It's where I hid
every time that we played.</i>

01:30:13.871 --> 01:30:14.938
<i>I love you, Hank.</i>

01:30:31.539 --> 01:30:32.573
Daddy?

01:30:37.251 --> 01:30:38.351
Daddy?

01:30:41.626 --> 01:30:44.563
Dad?
What's going on?

01:30:44.565 --> 01:30:45.605
Why haven't you found Mom?

01:30:48.139 --> 01:30:50.476
You look lost, Hank.
Are you all right?

01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:55.018
Still think you have
all the answers, Hank?

01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:52.534
It's me.

01:32:06.194 --> 01:32:08.164
I'm so sorry...

01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:11.702
it took so long.

01:32:11.704 --> 01:32:13.140
No.

01:32:14.612 --> 01:32:15.713
No.

01:32:16.649 --> 01:32:18.151
You're here now.

01:32:19.621 --> 01:32:20.722
Let's go home.

01:32:23.194 --> 01:32:25.430
I thought I was gone.

01:32:25.432 --> 01:32:28.571
But that energy
from your hands...

01:32:28.573 --> 01:32:29.775
how did you do that?

01:32:32.814 --> 01:32:35.751
I'm not the same woman I was
30 years ago, Henry.

01:32:35.753 --> 01:32:37.390
This place...

01:32:38.358 --> 01:32:40.394
it changes you.

01:32:42.399 --> 01:32:45.604
Adaptation is part of it,
but some of it is...

01:32:45.606 --> 01:32:46.608
evolution.

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:51.683
<i>Lab coordinates not found.</i>

01:32:51.685 --> 01:32:52.687
<i>Do not ascend.</i>

01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:55.322
I should probably tell you

01:32:55.324 --> 01:32:57.229
what we're dealing with
up there.

01:32:59.266 --> 01:33:01.736
I got the lab. I got the lab.

01:33:01.738 --> 01:33:04.208
Move.
Move.

01:33:04.944 --> 01:33:07.248
Move!

01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:09.250
Get out of the way.

01:33:14.797 --> 01:33:15.797
Let's go.

01:33:17.670 --> 01:33:21.410
<i>No one here appears
to be sure what this is.</i>

01:33:21.412 --> 01:33:24.251
<i>It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.</i>

01:33:29.393 --> 01:33:31.197
Get out of the way!

01:33:31.966 --> 01:33:35.238
I got the lab.

01:33:36.873 --> 01:33:38.442
The air feels chunky.

01:33:38.444 --> 01:33:39.879
Oh, no. He's too big.

01:33:43.721 --> 01:33:44.854
Scotty!

01:33:44.856 --> 01:33:46.360
Scott!

01:33:46.362 --> 01:33:48.362
I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:33:48.364 --> 01:33:51.000
I'm just gonna go to sleep now
for five minutes.

01:33:51.002 --> 01:33:52.505
I just need five minutes.

01:33:53.876 --> 01:33:55.212
Five minutes!

01:34:02.326 --> 01:34:03.759
You get the lab somewhere safe.

01:34:03.761 --> 01:34:06.332
- Scott's air won't last.
- Okay.

01:34:20.895 --> 01:34:22.464
Move!

01:34:22.466 --> 01:34:24.870
Move! Move!

01:34:26.841 --> 01:34:27.907
No, wait!

01:34:39.466 --> 01:34:41.367
<i>Lab at full scale.</i>

01:34:41.369 --> 01:34:42.536
They did it.

01:34:42.538 --> 01:34:43.973
<i>Ready to ascend.</i>

01:34:43.975 --> 01:34:45.612
Let's go see our daughter.

01:35:08.023 --> 01:35:09.023
Scott!

01:35:10.628 --> 01:35:12.129
Scott!

01:35:12.131 --> 01:35:13.969
Scott, come on, wake up!

01:35:28.564 --> 01:35:30.633
Come on.
Come on, where are you, Scott?

01:35:32.773 --> 01:35:34.108
Gotcha.

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.618
Scott?

01:35:45.764 --> 01:35:46.866
Hey.

01:35:46.868 --> 01:35:47.868
Hey.

01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:52.943
Hey, Scotty!
Hope, come in.

01:35:52.945 --> 01:35:54.582
Did you get crushed
by the building?

01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:00.058
Where's the remote, Luis?

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:01.529
It's probably in there.

01:36:02.565 --> 01:36:04.099
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

01:36:04.101 --> 01:36:05.604
I guess this is where we say...

01:36:06.305 --> 01:36:08.608
<i>Adios, amigo.</i>

01:36:08.610 --> 01:36:09.846
No, no, no, no!

01:36:13.019 --> 01:36:14.085
Thanks, guys.

01:36:20.935 --> 01:36:21.935
Ava?

01:36:22.605 --> 01:36:24.307
Ava!

01:36:27.212 --> 01:36:28.583
Ava!

01:36:28.585 --> 01:36:30.084
Almost ready for extraction.

01:36:30.086 --> 01:36:32.723
Please, stop!
People are getting hurt!

01:36:32.725 --> 01:36:35.195
Everything hurts.
Don't talk to me about pain!

01:36:35.197 --> 01:36:36.930
What if Hank is right?

01:36:36.932 --> 01:36:38.768
What if this process
kills Janet?

01:36:38.770 --> 01:36:40.204
What, you're worried about her?

01:36:40.206 --> 01:36:42.075
All I'm saying is that she is
a brilliant scientist.

01:36:42.077 --> 01:36:43.644
She may be able to help.

01:36:43.646 --> 01:36:46.282
Oh, she will help.
Right now!

01:36:46.284 --> 01:36:48.286
And if she dies, she dies!

01:36:48.288 --> 01:36:51.159
No, no. I'm sorry,
we can't do this.

01:36:51.161 --> 01:36:52.965
We have to find another way.

01:36:56.104 --> 01:36:58.106
This is the way.

01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.686
Janet!

01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:33.009
She started the extraction.

01:37:33.011 --> 01:37:34.814
She's gonna tear Mom apart.

01:37:43.966 --> 01:37:44.969
No!

01:38:19.503 --> 01:38:20.503
Hope!

01:38:37.472 --> 01:38:38.842
Are you okay?

01:38:53.439 --> 01:38:55.242
Mom?

01:39:03.292 --> 01:39:04.594
Oh, my God.

01:39:09.938 --> 01:39:11.306
We found you.

01:39:15.314 --> 01:39:17.550
I missed you so much.

01:39:17.552 --> 01:39:19.590
I missed you too, Jellybean.

01:39:22.529 --> 01:39:23.696
It's okay.

01:39:23.698 --> 01:39:26.903
I'm here now.
We have time.

01:39:28.975 --> 01:39:30.945
No more last-minute
business trips, okay?

01:39:31.246 --> 01:39:33.316
I promise.

01:39:33.318 --> 01:39:34.686
No, it's okay!

01:39:34.688 --> 01:39:36.421
It's all right.
Just don't worry about me.

01:39:36.423 --> 01:39:38.159
- I'll be fine.
- Dad.

01:39:43.337 --> 01:39:45.305
Scott.

01:39:45.307 --> 01:39:46.978
Miss Van Dyne.

01:39:48.349 --> 01:39:50.317
It's nice to...

01:39:50.319 --> 01:39:51.718
Well, I guess we've already met.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.090
Yeah. I guess we have.

01:39:57.131 --> 01:39:58.134
Wait.

01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:08.019
Your pain.

01:40:10.091 --> 01:40:11.226
I can feel it.

01:40:13.798 --> 01:40:15.068
It hurts.

01:40:17.405 --> 01:40:19.076
It always hurts.

01:40:22.215 --> 01:40:23.516
I'm sorry.

01:40:26.657 --> 01:40:28.726
I think I can help you.

01:41:03.230 --> 01:41:04.765
Did you know she could do that?

01:41:08.239 --> 01:41:09.841
It's okay.

01:41:12.515 --> 01:41:13.683
Guys, the cops are coming!

01:41:14.185 --> 01:41:15.185
Whoa.

01:41:17.259 --> 01:41:20.562
The cops are coming.
Like, all of 'em!

01:41:20.564 --> 01:41:22.201
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

01:41:23.302 --> 01:41:24.572
What about them?

01:41:27.612 --> 01:41:29.748
Hands in the air!

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:32.320
- No! We are going to our jobs.
- No.

01:41:32.322 --> 01:41:34.322
You see, we see these guys.
They trying to shoot people.

01:41:34.324 --> 01:41:37.696
So we apprehended them.
For you. You're welcome.

01:41:37.698 --> 01:41:39.901
We traffic in stolen technology.

01:41:39.903 --> 01:41:41.737
And we have killed many,
many people.

01:41:41.739 --> 01:41:43.540
Uh, he's in charge.

01:41:43.542 --> 01:41:44.542
That's true, I am.

01:41:45.381 --> 01:41:46.379
I've also committed

01:41:46.381 --> 01:41:48.751
numerous health code
violations in my restaurant.

01:41:48.753 --> 01:41:50.757
Some of them would shock you.

01:41:53.898 --> 01:41:56.269
It is truth serum.

01:42:00.444 --> 01:42:01.978
We gotta get outta here.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.582
Fast.

01:42:04.752 --> 01:42:06.921
I have an idea.

01:42:06.923 --> 01:42:08.023
<i>Giant figure, now spotted</i>

01:42:08.025 --> 01:42:09.526
<i>at the intersection of
Broadway and Laguna.</i>

01:42:09.528 --> 01:42:10.794
<i>All units move in.</i>

01:42:10.796 --> 01:42:12.398
Go, go!

01:42:15.408 --> 01:42:16.643
There he is!

01:42:21.854 --> 01:42:23.687
It's over, Scotty!

01:42:23.689 --> 01:42:26.660
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!

01:42:26.662 --> 01:42:28.665
Come on.
It's the end of the line, pal.

01:42:28.667 --> 01:42:29.667
There's nowhere to hide.

01:42:31.773 --> 01:42:34.712
Just pull off that Band-Aid!
You lost! It's okay!

01:42:36.617 --> 01:42:38.887
Damn it, Scotty,
reduce yourself!

01:42:44.998 --> 01:42:46.568
Magic.

01:42:48.773 --> 01:42:49.941
Damn it!

01:42:49.943 --> 01:42:51.680
Get to Lang's, now!

01:42:58.359 --> 01:43:00.361
Well done, honey.

01:43:00.363 --> 01:43:01.698
Let's go!

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.014
Leave me here.

01:43:11.016 --> 01:43:12.451
We can make it.

01:43:12.453 --> 01:43:13.453
You said it yourself.

01:43:14.759 --> 01:43:16.928
I've hurt people.

01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:18.766
But you haven't.

01:43:18.768 --> 01:43:20.634
Go. Please!

01:43:20.636 --> 01:43:21.738
We can make it, Ava.

01:43:22.439 --> 01:43:23.674
Bill...

01:43:24.545 --> 01:43:25.880
I'm not leaving you.

01:44:09.667 --> 01:44:11.702
Oh, hey, guys.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:13.442
Are my two years up already?

01:44:20.256 --> 01:44:22.291
What's it like out there?

01:44:22.293 --> 01:44:25.696
Huh? I mean,
do people still dance?

01:44:25.698 --> 01:44:27.968
Are food trucks still a thing?

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.906
Well, you got away with it
this time, Scott...

01:44:29.908 --> 01:44:32.946
but, uh,
I'll be seeing you again.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.180
Where?

01:44:35.118 --> 01:44:36.184
Huh?

01:44:36.186 --> 01:44:37.823
Where will you be
seeing me again?

01:44:38.824 --> 01:44:42.299
Like, in general...

01:44:42.301 --> 01:44:44.168
The next time
you do something bad,

01:44:44.170 --> 01:44:45.803
- I'll be there to catch you...
- Oh.

01:44:45.805 --> 01:44:48.075
You'll be watching...

01:44:48.077 --> 01:44:50.113
I thought you were
inviting me somewhere.

01:44:51.117 --> 01:44:53.186
Why would I do that?

01:44:53.188 --> 01:44:55.723
That's what I was wondering,
why would you do that?

01:44:55.725 --> 01:44:57.193
Like a party, or like,
dinner or something?

01:44:57.195 --> 01:44:59.298
I don't know. I thought you
planned the evening.

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.834
I meant, "I'll arrest you
later, again."

01:45:00.836 --> 01:45:02.003
Of course,
that would be strange.

01:45:02.005 --> 01:45:03.807
- Take it easy, Jimmy.
- Okay.

01:45:05.011 --> 01:45:06.647
Did you want to grab dinner,
or something?

01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:08.750
I mean, because I'm free...

01:45:08.752 --> 01:45:10.121
Yeah. Come on.

01:45:19.675 --> 01:45:20.406
You ready?

01:45:20.408 --> 01:45:21.610
Yeah!

01:45:23.716 --> 01:45:25.118
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

01:45:26.287 --> 01:45:28.656
Oh!

01:45:28.658 --> 01:45:30.827
Yes, that was us.
How can I help you?

01:45:31.698 --> 01:45:32.698
X-Con Security.

01:45:34.002 --> 01:45:35.005
Mr. Karapetyan?

01:45:35.838 --> 01:45:37.976
Yeah, you saw that?

01:45:37.978 --> 01:45:41.950
It would be an honor to be
in business with you as well.

01:45:41.952 --> 01:45:43.392
I'll see you Thursday,
9:00 AM. Okay.

01:45:44.322 --> 01:45:45.924
Yeah!

01:45:45.926 --> 01:45:48.163
That's how you close a deal!

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.223
This is awesome.

01:46:18.992 --> 01:46:20.527
So, Cassie...

01:46:20.529 --> 01:46:22.530
what do you want to be
when you grow up?

01:46:22.532 --> 01:46:24.534
I wanna help people...

01:46:24.536 --> 01:46:25.536
like my dad.

01:46:26.439 --> 01:46:27.442
Really?

01:46:29.011 --> 01:46:30.847
I wanted to be his partner.

01:46:30.849 --> 01:46:32.217
But he said he wants you.

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:34.422
Is that so?

01:46:39.298 --> 01:46:40.467
Daddy!

01:46:41.503 --> 01:46:43.406
Whoa! Hold on.

01:46:43.408 --> 01:46:45.477
Move, get outta here!

01:46:45.479 --> 01:46:47.479
Scott, don't, don't, don't!

01:46:47.481 --> 01:46:49.552
Ow.

01:46:49.554 --> 01:46:51.821
Oh, gross!

01:46:51.823 --> 01:46:54.259
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!

01:46:54.261 --> 01:46:58.001
Go! Shoo! Shoo!

01:49:05.355 --> 01:49:07.491
I used to be
a respected scientist.

01:49:07.493 --> 01:49:10.432
I had my name
on the sides of buildings.

01:49:10.733 --> 01:49:12.735
Now, I got this.

01:49:12.737 --> 01:49:15.842
Well, you wanted
a smaller quantum tunnel.

01:49:15.844 --> 01:49:18.615
This is... smaller.

01:49:19.851 --> 01:49:23.290
Oh. Sorry. My bad.

01:49:23.292 --> 01:49:25.327
Ah, I think it has flair.

01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.403
All right. Control's online.

01:49:32.176 --> 01:49:34.513
The collection unit activates
when you decouple it.

01:49:34.515 --> 01:49:36.182
It should automatically
start absorbing

01:49:36.184 --> 01:49:37.919
quantum healing particles.

01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:40.692
Also, make sure you stay
out of the tardigrade fields.

01:49:40.694 --> 01:49:42.394
They're cute,
but they'll eat you.

01:49:42.396 --> 01:49:44.298
And don't get sucked
into a time vortex.

01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.469
We won't be able to save you.

01:49:48.542 --> 01:49:49.643
Okay.

01:49:50.947 --> 01:49:52.315
Going subatomic in five...

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:54.586
four...

01:49:54.922 --> 01:49:56.125
three...

01:49:56.591 --> 01:49:57.692
two...

01:49:57.694 --> 01:49:58.694
one.

01:50:02.369 --> 01:50:04.774
All right, Scott,
this is a mic check.

01:50:09.985 --> 01:50:12.353
<i>Mic check, one, two.
One, two.</i>

01:50:12.355 --> 01:50:14.893
<i>How's everybody doing tonight
in the quantum realm?</i>

01:50:14.895 --> 01:50:16.294
Scott, we read you.

01:50:16.296 --> 01:50:17.498
I just wanna make sure.

01:50:23.244 --> 01:50:24.646
Okay.

01:50:24.648 --> 01:50:27.352
Healing particles secured
for our new Ghost friend.

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:28.519
<i>Great.</i>

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:30.258
<i>Preparing for re-entry in...</i>

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:32.861
<i>five, four, three...</i>

01:50:36.404 --> 01:50:37.573
Hello?

01:50:38.908 --> 01:50:41.045
Ha, ha. Very funny.

01:50:41.047 --> 01:50:42.548
Hank, quit screwing around.

01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:44.721
You told me yourself
not to screw around.

01:50:45.756 --> 01:50:46.756
<i>Hank?</i>

01:50:48.296 --> 01:50:49.431
<i>Hope?</i>

01:50:49.864 --> 01:50:50.865
<i>Janet.</i>

01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:53.271
<i>Guys.</i>

01:50:54.506 --> 01:50:56.677
<i>Guys.</i>

01:50:56.679 --> 01:50:58.045
<i>Okay, seriously,
don't joke around.</i>

01:50:58.047 --> 01:50:59.580
<i>Bring me up, let's go.</i>

01:50:59.582 --> 01:51:00.585
<i>Guys!</i>

01:51:04.695 --> 01:51:09.695
