WEBVTT

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.496
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:30.672
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.391
Go back to the Shadow.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.105
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:54.530
You shall not pass!

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.350
No! No!

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.561
Gandalf!

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.820
Fly, you fools.

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:37.322
No!

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.368
Gandalf!

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.855
Gandalf!

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:55.150
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.779
Nothing.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.163
Just a dream.

00:04:21.302 --> 00:04:22.511
Can you see the bottom?

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.932
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

00:04:37.735 --> 00:04:39.903
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.950
Mr. Frodo!

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.288
I think I've found the bottom.

00:04:54.711 --> 00:04:57.671
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:01.091
It's not natural. None of it.

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.346
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:08.765
Just a bit of seasoning.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.190
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.896
Roast chicken?!

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:16.773
You never know.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.235
Sam. My dear Sam.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:25.824
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:29.077
It is special.

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.875
It's a little bit of home.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.589
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:44.551
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:49.264
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:51.850
Real Elvish rope.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.145
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.272
Won't come free in a hurry.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.367
Real Elvish rope.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:26.968
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

00:06:27.136 --> 00:06:29.346
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.848
It's just where we can't get.

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:36.311
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.358
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:46.321
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.615
but they did.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.712
Mr. Frodo?

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:08.051
It's the Ring, isn't it?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.638
It's getting heavier.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.987
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:29.781
Oh, yes. Lovely.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:32.701
Lembas bread. And look!

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.414
More lembas bread.

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:50.135
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.305
but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:57.684
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:05.817
Those rain clouds might.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.854
This looks strangely familiar.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.941
It's because we've been here before.

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:48.693
We're going in circles.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.279
What is that horrid stink?

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:53.657
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:55.742
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.038
I can smell it.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:05.752
We're not alone.

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:23.478
The thieves. The thieves.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:27.607
The filthy little thieves.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:33.321
Where is it?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.242
They stole it from us.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.621
My precious.

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:45.750
Curse them, we hates them!

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:50.005
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.853
This is Sting.

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.563
You've seen it before...

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:51.232
haven't you, Gollum?

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.782
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.633
It burns!

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.094
It burns us!

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:22.097
It freezes!

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.101
Nasty Elves twisted it.

00:11:26.268 --> 00:11:28.937
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:36.611
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.406
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:43.159
That would kill us! Kill us!

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.037
It's no more than you deserve!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.749
Maybe he does deserve to die.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:55.630
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:03.930
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.933
Take it off us.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:13.982
We swears to do what you wants.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.151
We swears.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.820
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.283
We swears...

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:28.246
to serve the master
of the precious.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.208
We will swear on...

00:12:32.376 --> 00:12:34.335
on the precious.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.713
Gollum. Gollum.

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:41.009
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:43.178
Yes...

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.264
on the precious.

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:51.060
On the precious.

00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:53.730
I don't believe you!

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:59.235
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.154
He's trying to trick us.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:04.365
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:20.340
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.011
You've been there before?

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.597
Yes.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.110
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:53.540
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:58.545
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:03.007
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.636
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:12.767
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:15.812
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:21.109
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.907
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.537
There! What did I tell you?

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.914
He's run off, the old villain.

00:14:35.082 --> 00:14:37.625
So much for his promises.

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:39.419
This way, Hobbits.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.713
Follow me!

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:56.936
Merry!

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.397
Merry!

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:08.740
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.742
He wants the Shire-rats now.

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:16.164
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:20.293
Saruman will have his prize.

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:23.630
We will deliver them.

00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.220
Merry!

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.723
Merry? Wake up.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:39.062
My friend is sick.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.148
He needs water. Please!

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.861
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:51.741
Stop it!

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:56.579
Can't take his draught!

00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:01.876
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:05.296
You want some? Huh?

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.883
Then keep your mouth shut.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.389
Merry.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:16.724
Hello, Pip.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.979
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:23.690
- It was just an act.
- An act?

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:27.193
See? I fooled you too.

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.614
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.910
What is it? What do you smell?

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:38.204
Man-flesh.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.709
They've picked up our trail.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:44.919
Aragorn.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.464
Let's move!

00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:14.574
Their pace has quickened.

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.577
They must have caught our scent.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:19.495
Hurry!

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.959
Come on, Gimli!

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.007
Three days and nights pursuit.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:34.135
No food. No rest.

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:38.306
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:13.007
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.636
They may yet be alive.

00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.139
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:25.228
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:29.690
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.528
Very dangerous over short distances.

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:46.958
Rohan.

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:49.919
Home of the Horse-lords.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.673
There's something strange at work here.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.843
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

00:18:57.052 --> 00:18:59.971
Sets its will against us.

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:08.062
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.815
The Uruks turn northeast.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.818
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:15.945
Saruman.

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:27.540
The world is changing.

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:33.337
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.757
and Mordor?

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:44.056
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

00:19:44.224 --> 00:19:47.894
and the union of the two towers?

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.361
Together, my Lord Sauron...

00:19:57.529 --> 00:20:01.115
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:21.385
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:25.223
The forests will fall.

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.977
A new order will rise.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:35.942
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:40.154
and the iron fists of the Orc.

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:55.795
I want them armed and
ready to march within two weeks!

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.630
But, my lord, there are too many!

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.800
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

00:21:00.968 --> 00:21:04.178
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:07.181
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

00:21:08.475 --> 00:21:12.770
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

00:21:14.189 --> 00:21:16.524
- Burn it.
- Yes.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.527
We will fight for you.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:21.696
Swear it.

00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:36.961
We will die for Saruman.

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:40.047
The Horse-Men took your lands.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:44.760
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:46.345
Murderers!

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.390
Take back the lands they stole from you.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.350
Burn every village!

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:59.734
We have only to
remove those who oppose us.

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:02.778
It will begin in Rohan.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.033
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:09.035
But no more.

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:11.454
Éothain! Éothain!

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.292
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:19.337
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:21.172
He is too big for him.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.342
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:27.053
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

00:22:27.304 --> 00:22:30.222
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:34.101
Freda, I will find you there.

00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:40.775
Quickly!

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.699
Go, child.

00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:03.547
Rohan, my lord...

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.717
is ready to fall.

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:19.480
Théodred.

00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:21.315
Find the king's son!

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:43.838
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:47.508
My Lord Éomer, over here!

00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:58.018
He's alive.

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.051
Théodred.

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:47.443
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

00:24:47.903 --> 00:24:50.404
He was ambushed by Orcs.

00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:55.534
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:58.412
That is a lie.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:05.461
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:09.131
Gríma.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:16.555
Gríma.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:20.434
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:24.438
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.942
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:41.580
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

00:25:41.748 --> 00:25:44.208
Can you not see?

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:49.421
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:52.132
your warmongering.

00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:56.303
Warmongering?

00:25:56.471 --> 00:25:58.639
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:01.850
What was the promised price, Gríma?

00:26:02.102 --> 00:26:05.771
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:20.869
Too long have you watched my sister.

00:26:21.037 --> 00:26:23.038
Too long have you haunted her steps.

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:35.426
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:36.760
Too much.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:43.892
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:48.856
and all its domains
under pain of death.

00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.650
You have no authority here.

00:26:51.818 --> 00:26:54.278
Your orders mean nothing.

00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:58.657
This order does not come from me.

00:26:58.825 --> 00:27:01.035
It comes from the king.

00:27:01.578 --> 00:27:04.246
He signed it this morning.

00:27:35.779 --> 00:27:38.489
Keep breathing. That's the key.

00:27:38.698 --> 00:27:40.407
Breathe.

00:27:44.579 --> 00:27:48.374
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

00:28:04.599 --> 00:28:06.558
We're not going no further...

00:28:06.726 --> 00:28:08.727
until we've had a breather.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.230
Get a fire going!

00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:18.612
Merry!

00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:25.494
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:37.131
What's making that noise?

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.175
It's the trees.

00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:41.969
What?

00:28:42.303 --> 00:28:46.140
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:50.811
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

00:28:50.979 --> 00:28:52.521
and come alive.

00:28:52.772 --> 00:28:54.440
Alive?

00:28:55.316 --> 00:28:57.025
Trees that could whisper...

00:28:58.027 --> 00:29:00.487
talk to each other...

00:29:00.655 --> 00:29:02.531
even move.

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:06.368
I'm starving.

00:29:06.536 --> 00:29:10.664
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:12.249
Yeah!

00:29:12.459 --> 00:29:15.711
Why can't we have some meat?!

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.299
What about them?

00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:22.342
They're fresh.

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:26.805
They are not for eating.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:34.730
What about their legs?

00:29:34.898 --> 00:29:37.232
They don't need those.

00:29:38.693 --> 00:29:41.862
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:48.577
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:50.871
Alive?

00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:58.128
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

00:30:00.507 --> 00:30:03.884
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:07.095
The master wants it for the war.

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:11.850
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.

00:30:12.018 --> 00:30:14.436
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.273
Just a mouthful...

00:30:18.441 --> 00:30:19.650
a bit of the flank.

00:30:26.449 --> 00:30:30.035
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

00:30:36.626 --> 00:30:37.876
Pippin.

00:30:38.044 --> 00:30:39.753
Let's go.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.721
Go on.

00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:51.390
Call for help.

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:53.851
Squeal.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.271
No one's going to save you now.

00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:07.865
Pippin!

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.600
A red sun rises.

00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:38.020
Blood has been spilled this night.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.136
Riders of Rohan...

00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:13.972
what news from the Mark?

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:46.129
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.173
Speak quickly!

00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:53.178
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:04.898
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.693
if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

00:33:08.736 --> 00:33:10.821
You would die before your stroke fell.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:21.415
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:25.961
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:29.423
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.845
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:37.264
Not even his own kin.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:43.729
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

00:33:43.938 --> 00:33:45.856
and claimed lordship over these lands.

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:50.819
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.738
And for that, we are banished.

00:33:54.824 --> 00:33:58.118
The White Wizard is cunning.

00:33:58.786 --> 00:34:01.204
He walks here and there, they say...

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:03.457
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:09.087
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:11.465
We are no spies.

00:34:11.632 --> 00:34:14.593
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

00:34:14.886 --> 00:34:17.220
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:20.474
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:23.810
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:26.980
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:32.277
We left none alive.

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:35.864
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:42.579
Dead?

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.292
I am sorry.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.133
Hasufel! Arod!

00:34:57.011 --> 00:35:01.640
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.518
Farewell.

00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:11.942
Look for your friends.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.611
But do not trust to hope.

00:35:16.322 --> 00:35:18.865
It has forsaken these lands.

00:35:19.075 --> 00:35:21.076
We ride north!

00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:13.587
It's one of their wee belts.

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.352
We failed them.

00:36:43.409 --> 00:36:45.619
A Hobbit lay here.

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:49.122
And the other.

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.468
They crawled.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.766
Their hands were bound.

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.738
Their bonds were cut.

00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:39.297
They ran over here.

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:44.177
They were followed.

00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.099
The belt!

00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:54.187
Run!

00:37:57.817 --> 00:37:59.217
Tracks lead away from the battle...

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.199
into Fangorn Forest.

00:38:07.034 --> 00:38:08.493
Fangorn?

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:11.288
What madness drove them in there?

00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:32.017
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:42.152
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:49.367
Come here!

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:57.459
Trees. Climb a tree.

00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:08.553
He's gone.

00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:22.942
Merry!

00:39:34.413 --> 00:39:38.792
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.467
Run, Merry!

00:39:57.311 --> 00:40:01.606
Little Orcs.

00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:04.109
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:06.152
Tree?

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.322
I am no tree!

00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:11.741
I am an Ent.

00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:14.452
A tree-herder.

00:40:14.954 --> 00:40:16.955
A shepherd of the forest.

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.456
Don't talk to it, Merry.

00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.458
Don't encourage it!

00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:24.879
Treebeard, some call me.

00:40:25.047 --> 00:40:27.006
And whose side are you on?

00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:29.259
Side?

00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:32.345
I am on nobody's side...

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:38.017
because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

00:40:38.853 --> 00:40:43.481
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:46.234
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:48.695
Hobbits?

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:54.868
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:59.289
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.876
They come with fire.

00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:05.670
They come with axes.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.675
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:14.679
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:17.682
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:19.684
Halflings!

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:21.019
Shire-folk!

00:41:21.187 --> 00:41:23.521
Maybe you are...

00:41:23.814 --> 00:41:27.442
and maybe you aren't.

00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:32.447
The White Wizard will know.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.200
The White Wizard?

00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:38.203
Saruman.

00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.467
See? See?

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:55.053
We've led you out.

00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:57.764
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.436
Very lucky we find you.

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:11.778
Nice Hobbit.

00:42:13.447 --> 00:42:17.951
Oh! It's a bog. He's led us
into a swamp.

00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:20.745
A swamp, yes, yes.

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:26.251
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

00:42:28.546 --> 00:42:32.006
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:37.887
I found it. I did.

00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:40.765
The way through the marshes.

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:44.477
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:48.731
They go around for miles and miles.

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:50.358
Come quickly.

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:54.612
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

00:42:55.781 --> 00:42:59.117
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:01.536
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:05.123
No, no birdses to eat.

00:43:05.374 --> 00:43:09.627
No crunchable birdses.

00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:13.089
And we are famished! Yes!

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.552
Famished we are, precious!

00:43:32.526 --> 00:43:34.027
Here.

00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:37.238
What does it eats?

00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:39.365
Is it tasty?

00:43:44.663 --> 00:43:47.290
It tries to chokes us!

00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:51.210
We can't eats Hobbit food!

00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:56.966
We must starve!

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.552
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

00:44:00.262 --> 00:44:02.513
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:05.558
It does not care if we be hungry.

00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:10.563
Does not care if we should die.

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:13.983
Not like master.

00:44:15.361 --> 00:44:17.445
Master cares.

00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:20.490
Master knows.

00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:24.911
Yes.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.705
Precious.

00:44:31.293 --> 00:44:34.921
Once it takes hold of us...

00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:40.968
it never lets go.

00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:42.804
Don't touch me!

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:17.171
There are dead things!

00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.132
Dead faces in the water.

00:45:23.929 --> 00:45:27.932
All dead. All rotten.

00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:32.228
Elves and Men and Orcses.

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:36.023
A great battle long ago.

00:45:36.817 --> 00:45:38.568
Dead Marshes.

00:45:38.777 --> 00:45:41.487
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:44.949
This way.

00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.869
Don't follow the lights.

00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:53.458
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:57.795
and light little candles
of their own.

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:25.490
Frodo!

00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:14.664
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:16.624
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:18.751
Are you all right?

00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:50.575
So bright.

00:47:50.784 --> 00:47:54.579
So beautiful.

00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:58.583
Our precious.

00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:01.502
What did you say?

00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:03.963
Master should be resting.

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:08.217
Master needs to keep up his strength.

00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:13.431
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.099
Gollum. Gollum.

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.149
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:21.355
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

00:48:21.523 --> 00:48:23.107
He said your life was a sad story.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:27.820
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:30.990
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

00:48:31.158 --> 00:48:32.950
Were you?

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.371
Sméagol.

00:48:42.085 --> 00:48:44.629
What did you call me?

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:48.716
That was your name once, wasn't it?

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:51.636
A long time ago.

00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:57.224
My name.

00:49:04.149 --> 00:49:06.651
Sméagol.

00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:12.365
Black Riders!

00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:13.866
Hide! Hide!

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.754
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:30.549
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.011
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

00:49:34.179 --> 00:49:37.098
No, you cannot kill them. No.

00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.376
Wraiths!

00:50:05.544 --> 00:50:07.753
Wraiths on wings!

00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:17.805
They are calling for it.

00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:21.475
They are calling for the precious.

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.813
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:27.231
I'm here.

00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:44.790
Hurry, Hobbits.

00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:49.253
The Black Gate is very close.

00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:58.012
Orc blood.

00:51:08.023 --> 00:51:09.774
These are strange tracks.

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:13.027
The air is so close in here.

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.655
This forest is old.

00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:19.492
Very old.

00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:23.496
Full of memory...

00:51:26.124 --> 00:51:28.501
and anger.

00:51:34.633 --> 00:51:37.510
The trees are speaking to each other.

00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:39.178
Gimli!

00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.305
Lower your ax.

00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:46.852
They have feelings, my friend.

00:51:47.395 --> 00:51:49.396
The Elves began it.

00:51:49.564 --> 00:51:54.318
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:57.154
Talking trees.

00:51:57.823 --> 00:52:00.825
What do trees have to talk about?

00:52:01.034 --> 00:52:04.245
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.337
Aragorn. Something's out there.

00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:17.759
What do you see?

00:52:18.176 --> 00:52:20.636
The White Wizard approaches.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.105
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.950
We must be quick.

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:02.178
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:04.180
Where are they?

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:07.892
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

00:53:08.101 --> 00:53:12.354
They met someone they did not expect.

00:53:12.522 --> 00:53:14.648
Does that comfort you?

00:53:14.816 --> 00:53:16.775
Who are you?

00:53:18.236 --> 00:53:20.237
Show yourself!

00:53:29.122 --> 00:53:31.123
It cannot be.

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.127
Forgive me.

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.631
I mistook you for Saruman.

00:53:39.424 --> 00:53:42.176
I am Saruman.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:47.640
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.059
You fell.

00:53:51.519 --> 00:53:54.063
Through fire...

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.522
and water.

00:53:56.983 --> 00:53:59.526
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

00:53:59.694 --> 00:54:03.447
I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

00:54:19.297 --> 00:54:22.007
Until at last
I threw down my enemy...

00:54:22.175 --> 00:54:26.679
and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:35.229
Darkness took me...

00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:40.067
and I strayed out of thought
and time.

00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:43.904
Stars wheeled overhead...

00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:48.701
and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:52.913
But it was not the end.

00:54:53.206 --> 00:54:56.000
I felt life in me again.

00:54:57.919 --> 00:55:00.462
I've been sent back...

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:02.214
until my task is done.

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.508
Gandalf.

00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:07.219
Gandalf?

00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:09.388
Yes.

00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:13.976
That was what they used to call me.

00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:19.106
Gandalf the Grey.

00:55:20.442 --> 00:55:22.234
That was my name.

00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:23.819
Gandalf.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.865
I am Gandalf the White.

00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:33.954
And I come back to you now...

00:55:34.122 --> 00:55:36.623
at the turn of the tide.

00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:40.753
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

00:55:41.463 --> 00:55:44.631
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:47.593
That is no short distance!

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:51.055
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

00:55:51.264 --> 00:55:53.349
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

00:55:53.516 --> 00:55:56.935
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

00:55:57.103 --> 00:55:59.104
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

00:55:59.272 --> 00:56:03.192
in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

00:56:06.112 --> 00:56:09.281
I mean, charming...

00:56:09.449 --> 00:56:12.201
quite charming forest.

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:16.413
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

00:56:16.581 --> 00:56:20.918
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:24.546
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:28.050
that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:30.386
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:34.973
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

00:56:37.811 --> 00:56:44.233
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:48.028
The Ents are going to wake up...

00:56:48.571 --> 00:56:53.075
and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

00:56:53.827 --> 00:56:54.993
Oh, that's good.

00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:57.871
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

00:56:58.957 --> 00:57:01.208
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:05.045
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

00:57:05.213 --> 00:57:08.966
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:32.656
That is one of the Mearas...

00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:35.617
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

00:57:53.219 --> 00:57:55.512
Shadowfax.

00:57:58.099 --> 00:58:00.684
He is the lord of all horses...

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:06.231
and has been my friend
through many dangers.

00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:24.082
O rowan mine

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.045
I saw you shine

00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:31.757
Upon a summer's day

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:37.346
Upon your head How golden-red

00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:42.226
The crown you bore aloft

00:58:42.435 --> 00:58:44.811
Such a beautiful verse.

00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:49.900
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:53.320
You might call it far, perhaps.

00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:58.033
My home lies deep in the forest...

00:58:58.243 --> 00:59:02.120
near the roots of the mountain.

00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:07.125
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

00:59:07.335 --> 00:59:11.338
And safe is where I'll keep you.

00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:15.968
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

00:59:16.344 --> 00:59:19.346
It's one of my own compositions.

00:59:19.514 --> 00:59:20.722
Right.

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:27.020
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:32.067
And the dreams of trees unfold

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:38.699
When woodland halls are green and cool

00:59:38.866 --> 00:59:42.995
And the wind is in the West

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:51.086
Come back to me

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:57.676
And say my land is best

00:59:59.178 --> 01:00:01.138
Oh.

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.812
Sleep, little Shirelings.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:12.566
Heed no nightly noise.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:16.653
Sleep till morning light.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:22.451
I have business in the forest.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:28.165
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:34.046
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:39.926
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:53.732
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.152
Sauron will suffer no rival.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:01.865
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:05.452
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.455
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.208
The rumor has reached him.

01:01:11.376 --> 01:01:14.336
The heir of Númenor still lives.

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:18.131
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:21.635
He fears what you may become.

01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:26.306
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:30.102
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.770
War is coming.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:35.524
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.110
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:41.988
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:45.242
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.122
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:53.083
But for all their cunning...

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.836
we have one advantage.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:00.549
The Ring remains hidden.

01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:03.552
And that we should seek to destroy it...

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.680
has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:10.600
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:12.269
in the hands of a Hobbit.

01:02:12.437 --> 01:02:16.523
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:19.317
We must trust now in Frodo.

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:21.319
Everything depends upon speed...

01:02:21.487 --> 01:02:24.489
and the secrecy of his quest.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:29.786
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

01:02:30.663 --> 01:02:33.415
Frodo must finish this task alone.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.460
He's not alone.

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.336
Sam went with him.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.213
Did he?

01:02:40.381 --> 01:02:45.010
Did he, indeed? Good.

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:48.054
Yes, very good.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:03:00.942
The Black Gate of Mordor.

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.239
Oh, save us.

01:03:11.996 --> 01:03:15.248
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:21.963
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.550
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:26.968
I did.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:37.729
That's it, then.

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:40.565
We can't get past that.

01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:27.112
Look!

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.738
The gate.

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:30.115
It's opening!

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.541
I can see a way down.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.377
Sam, no!

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.922
Master!

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:13.301
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:17.222
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.516
- Now!
- No!

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.060
No! No, master!

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:25.230
They catch you! They catch you!

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:29.067
Don't take it to him.

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:34.739
He wants the precious.

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:37.951
Always he is looking for it.

01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:42.038
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:46.167
But we mustn't let him have it.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.676
No! There's another way.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.512
More secret. A dark way.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:07:01.474
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:03.059
He's up to something.

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:06.229
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:09.149
Yes. There's a path...

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:11.818
and some stairs.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.695
And then...

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:17.198
a tunnel.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:32.964
He's led us this far, Sam.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:34.549
Mr. Frodo, no.

01:07:35.676 --> 01:07:37.135
He's been true to his word.

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.224
No.

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:46.978
Lead the way, Sméagol.

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:51.524
Good Sméagol always helps.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.518
Hello?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.022
Treebeard?

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.024
Where has he gone?

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:35.652
I had the loveliest dream last night.

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:38.988
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:41.658
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

01:08:42.159 --> 01:08:44.077
you were sick.

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:48.540
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:53.962
Did you hear that?

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.554
There it is again.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:06.975
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.732
You just said something... Treeish.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:18.903
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.329
You're taller.

01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:30.373
- Who?
- You!

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.167
- Than what?
- Than me!

01:09:32.668 --> 01:09:34.794
I've always been taller than you.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:39.591
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.968
Please, Merry.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:45.972
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.725
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.771
3'8"!

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.609
Three-foot-eight.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.530
You did something.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:09.913
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

01:10:10.831 --> 01:10:12.332
Merry!

01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:14.834
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:18.922
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.257
Give me it back. Merry!

01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:24.427
What's happening?!

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.763
It's got my leg!

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:28.640
Merry!

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:38.358
No!

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:49.661
Help!

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:58.211
Away with you.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.171
You should not be waking.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:05.677
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.805
Go to sleep.

01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:10.974
Away with you.

01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:14.477
Come, the forest is waking up.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.980
It isn't safe.

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:23.528
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.739
Anger festers in their hearts.

01:11:27.574 --> 01:11:29.200
Black are their thoughts.

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:31.911
Strong is their hate.

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:34.831
They will harm you if they can.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:38.584
There are too few of us now.

01:11:38.752 --> 01:11:42.755
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:46.009
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:49.387
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:55.184
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:12:00.606
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:02.275
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:06.362
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.782
We lost them.

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:15.038
And now we cannot find them.

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:21.419
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.172
Can't say that I have.

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.758
You, Pip?

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.553
What do they look like?

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:37.685
I don't remember now.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:57.997
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.417
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:05.004
whose mind is overthrown.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:09.425
Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:13.262
My lord, your son...

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:15.598
he is dead.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.935
My lord?

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.354
Uncle?

01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:30.446
Will you not go to him?

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:35.952
Will you do nothing?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.121
Be careful what you say.

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:40.456
Do not look for welcome here.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:08.693
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:11.028
What a tragedy for the king...

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.198
to lose his only son and heir.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:19.829
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:24.917
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:26.544
Leave me alone, snake!

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.672
Oh, but you are alone.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:36.053
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:39.682
in the bitter watches of the night...

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:43.519
when all your life seems to shrink.

01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:47.899
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

01:14:48.066 --> 01:14:52.653
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.782
So fair.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:14:59.410
So cold.

01:15:01.205 --> 01:15:03.414
Like a morning of pale spring...

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:07.043
still clinging to winter's chill.

01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:23.309
Your words are poison.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:58.321
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

01:17:11.543 --> 01:17:12.585
Ah.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:16.547
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.593
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:40.905
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:46.577
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:08.265
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:18.192
He's a herald of woe.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:22.738
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:25.282
Théoden King.

01:18:25.992 --> 01:18:28.536
He's not welcome.

01:18:29.454 --> 01:18:34.750
Why should I welcome you...

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:38.921
Gandalf Stormcrow?

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:42.425
A just question, my liege.

01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:45.428
Late is the hour...

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:49.640
in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:52.435
Láthspell I name him.

01:18:52.644 --> 01:18:55.521
Ill news is an ill guest.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:19:00.276
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.361
I have not passed
through fire and death...

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:05.781
to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.868
His staff.

01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:13.164
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:18.461
Théoden...

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.589
son of Thengel...

01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:25.718
too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.974
I would stay still if I were you.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:34.226
Hearken to me!

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:41.859
I release you...

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:43.986
from the spell.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.584
You have no power here...

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:02.379
Gandalf the Grey.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:12.848
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:23.818
Wait.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:29.073
If I go, Théoden dies.

01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:31.992
You did not kill me...

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.370
you will not kill him.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:39.959
Rohan is mine.

01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:42.795
Be gone.

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:29.466
I know your face.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:38.851
Éowyn.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:48.319
Gandalf?

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:51.739
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:07.713
Dark have been my dreams of late.

01:22:11.843 --> 01:22:15.638
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

01:22:15.847 --> 01:22:18.766
if they grasped your sword.

01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:05.896
I've only...

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:09.108
ever served you, my lord.

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:14.279
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:17.241
Send me not from your sight.

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:22.246
No, my lord! No, my lord.

01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:23.664
Let him go.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:27.584
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.054
Get out of my way!

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:44.435
Hail, Théoden King!

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:11.628
Where is Théodred?

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:17.134
Where is my son?

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:46.098
Simbelmynë.

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:54.857
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:01.655
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:07.661
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:12.833
The young perish and the old linger.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.544
That I should live...

01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:19.089
to see the last days of my house.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.178
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:30.601
No parent should have to bury
their child.

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.203
He was strong in life.

01:26:50.288 --> 01:26:53.874
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

01:27:38.461 --> 01:27:40.337
They had no warning.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:42.923
They were unarmed.

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:47.427
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:50.305
Rick, cot and tree.

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.808
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:57.854
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

01:27:58.022 --> 01:28:02.442
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

01:28:04.028 --> 01:28:07.030
Ride out and meet him head on.

01:28:07.782 --> 01:28:11.285
Draw him away from your women
and children.

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.245
You must fight.

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:17.249
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:19.042
Éomer is loyal to you.

01:28:19.210 --> 01:28:21.920
His men will return
and fight for their king.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:26.008
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:31.888
Éomer cannot help us.

01:28:32.515 --> 01:28:34.308
I know what it is you want of me...

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:37.728
but I will not bring further death
to my people.

01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.106
I will not risk open war.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.737
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:52.576
When last I looked...

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:56.663
Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:05.797
Then what is the king's decision?

01:29:11.387 --> 01:29:12.429
By order of the king...

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.348
the city must empty.

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:18.393
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:22.564
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.274
Helm's Deep.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.986
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:30.113
Who will defend them if not their king?

01:29:30.281 --> 01:29:32.741
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:34.743
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

01:29:34.911 --> 01:29:38.789
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:41.166
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:43.502
What they will get is a massacre.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.547
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:51.802
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.097
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:58.350
The people of Rohan will need you.

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:01.186
The defenses have to hold.

01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:04.356
They will hold.

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:10.654
The Grey Pilgrim.

01:30:10.822 --> 01:30:13.448
That's what they used to call me.

01:30:13.616 --> 01:30:18.745
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:22.541
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:26.378
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.965
At dawn, look to the east.

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:31.675
Go.

01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:02.372
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

01:31:41.412 --> 01:31:43.455
His name is Brego.

01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:46.917
He was my cousin's horse.

01:31:47.084 --> 01:31:48.919
Brego.

01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:06.061
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:09.523
but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

01:32:10.566 --> 01:32:12.984
You speak as one of their own.

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.239
I was raised in Rivendell...

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.032
for a time.

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:24.371
Turn this fellow free.

01:32:24.997 --> 01:32:27.499
He's seen enough of war.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:42.097
Gandalf the White.

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:44.641
Gandalf the Fool!

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:50.230
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:55.151
There were three
who followed the wizard.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:33:00.907
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

01:33:01.284 --> 01:33:04.077
You stink of horse.

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:11.209
The Man...

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:17.465
was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

01:33:17.633 --> 01:33:21.428
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

01:33:21.596 --> 01:33:23.388
His cloth was poor.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:29.436
And yet he bore a strange ring.

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:34.065
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

01:33:34.233 --> 01:33:40.071
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

01:33:40.239 --> 01:33:42.157
The Ring of Barahir.

01:33:43.117 --> 01:33:46.703
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:50.206
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:53.126
The line was broken years ago.

01:33:54.545 --> 01:33:56.004
It matters not.

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.715
The world of Men shall fall.

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:00.759
It will begin at Edoras.

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.895
I am ready, Gamling.

01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:14.564
Bring my horse.

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:19.069
This is not a defeat.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:29.489
We will return.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.897
You have some skill with a blade.

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:06.491
Women of this country learned long ago:

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:09.285
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

01:35:09.453 --> 01:35:11.287
I fear neither death nor pain.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.666
What do you fear, my lady?

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:19.879
A cage.

01:35:21.173 --> 01:35:25.009
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:29.139
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

01:35:32.518 --> 01:35:34.561
You're a daughter of kings...

01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:39.149
a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:46.948
I do not think that would be your fate.

01:36:19.982 --> 01:36:23.026
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:25.320
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:28.364
He will expect an attack on the city.

01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:32.952
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.455
the great fortress of Rohan.

01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:41.044
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.214
They will be slow.

01:36:44.590 --> 01:36:49.010
They will have women and children
with them.

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:55.225
Send out your Warg-riders.

01:37:10.032 --> 01:37:12.951
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

01:37:13.118 --> 01:37:15.787
- Why do you do that?
- What?

01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:18.498
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:20.959
Because.

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.629
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:27.006
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

01:37:27.424 --> 01:37:30.218
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:32.637
You have no idea what it did to him...

01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:35.306
what it's still doing to him.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.602
I want to help him, Sam.

01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:41.062
Why?

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.487
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:55.660
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:58.580
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

01:38:05.504 --> 01:38:09.716
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:11.676
I do.

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:15.597
It's the Ring.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.724
You can't take your eyes off it.

01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:20.435
I've seen you.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:24.731
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

01:38:26.483 --> 01:38:28.735
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.613
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

01:38:31.822 --> 01:38:34.699
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:36.618
Mine! My own!

01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:39.579
Can't you hear yourself?

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:41.414
Don't you know who you sound like?

01:38:51.675 --> 01:38:53.801
We wants it.

01:38:53.969 --> 01:38:56.679
We needs it.

01:38:56.847 --> 01:39:01.643
Must have the precious.

01:39:01.852 --> 01:39:05.271
They stole it from us.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:08.816
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

01:39:08.984 --> 01:39:12.862
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:16.324
No. Not master.

01:39:16.492 --> 01:39:20.328
Yes, precious. False.

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:24.999
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:28.586
Master's my friend.

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:33.883
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

01:39:35.094 --> 01:39:37.595
Not listening. I'm not listening.

01:39:37.763 --> 01:39:41.766
You're a liar and a thief.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:43.977
No.

01:39:44.895 --> 01:39:47.772
Murderer.

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:51.275
Go away.

01:39:51.443 --> 01:39:53.820
Go away?

01:39:55.823 --> 01:40:01.202
I hate you.

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:04.789
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:06.791
I saved us.

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:11.504
It was me. We survived because of me.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:16.300
Not anymore.

01:40:17.636 --> 01:40:19.220
What did you say?

01:40:21.265 --> 01:40:25.101
Master looks after us now.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:28.771
We don't need you.

01:40:29.481 --> 01:40:31.065
What?

01:40:31.233 --> 01:40:32.984
Leave now...

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:36.946
and never come back.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:38.156
No.

01:40:38.657 --> 01:40:42.869
Leave now and never come back.

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:51.377
Leave now and never come back!

01:41:03.348 --> 01:41:06.059
We told him to go away.

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:09.187
And away he goes, precious.

01:41:09.354 --> 01:41:11.355
Gone! Gone! Gone!

01:41:11.523 --> 01:41:13.316
Sméagol is free!

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.739
Look.

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:24.410
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:35.338
They are young.

01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:38.049
They are tender. They are nice.

01:41:38.217 --> 01:41:41.761
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

01:41:44.515 --> 01:41:46.057
You'll make him sick, you will...

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.519
behaving like that.

01:41:51.855 --> 01:41:54.649
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:00.404
What's it doing?

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:03.783
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.160
It ruins it.

01:42:06.328 --> 01:42:09.956
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

01:42:14.086 --> 01:42:16.671
What we need is a few good taters.

01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:20.591
What's taters, precious?

01:42:20.759 --> 01:42:22.510
What's taters? Eh?

01:42:22.678 --> 01:42:24.387
Po-ta-toes.

01:42:24.721 --> 01:42:27.974
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:34.981
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:38.192
Even you couldn't say no to that.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:40.695
Oh, yes, we could.

01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:44.365
Spoil a nice fish.

01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:48.286
Give it to us raw...

01:42:48.453 --> 01:42:51.497
and wriggling.

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:54.792
You keep nasty chips.

01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:57.795
You're hopeless.

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:11.809
Mr. Frodo?

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:32.371
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:34.999
Servants of Sauron.

01:43:35.792 --> 01:43:38.002
They are called to Mordor.

01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:41.214
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:44.550
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

01:43:46.136 --> 01:43:49.764
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

01:43:49.932 --> 01:43:55.144
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.230
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

01:43:58.649 --> 01:43:59.857
Mr. Frodo.

01:44:00.359 --> 01:44:01.984
Look.

01:44:05.656 --> 01:44:07.949
It's an oliphaunt.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:19.168
No one at home will believe this.

01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:32.181
Sméagol?

01:45:12.514 --> 01:45:15.016
We've lingered here too long.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.353
Come on, Sam.

01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:32.658
No!

01:45:32.826 --> 01:45:35.536
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

01:45:37.247 --> 01:45:42.335
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:45.379
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:50.134
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

01:45:50.302 --> 01:45:52.386
The enemy?

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:57.933
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

01:46:00.395 --> 01:46:02.521
You wonder what his name is...

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:06.275
where he came from.

01:46:08.278 --> 01:46:10.696
And if he was really evil at heart.

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:15.826
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

01:46:17.412 --> 01:46:19.914
If he would not rather have stayed there...

01:46:22.084 --> 01:46:23.626
in peace.

01:46:27.172 --> 01:46:30.216
War will make corpses of us all.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.426
Bind their hands.

01:46:39.357 --> 01:46:42.109
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

01:46:42.318 --> 01:46:45.946
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

01:46:46.114 --> 01:46:49.324
that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

01:46:49.659 --> 01:46:51.576
It's the beards.

01:46:51.828 --> 01:46:53.912
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.957
that there are no Dwarf women...

01:46:57.125 --> 01:47:01.378
and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

01:47:03.047 --> 01:47:04.447
which is, of course, ridiculous.

01:47:11.013 --> 01:47:13.348
It's all right. Nobody panic.

01:47:13.724 --> 01:47:15.725
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

01:47:17.645 --> 01:47:21.481
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

01:47:21.774 --> 01:47:24.526
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

01:47:24.694 --> 01:47:26.987
Cut down by Orcs.

01:47:27.155 --> 01:47:30.157
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

01:47:30.783 --> 01:47:35.495
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

01:47:35.663 --> 01:47:40.208
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

01:47:50.178 --> 01:47:52.554
Gimli.

01:47:52.722 --> 01:47:54.806
No, I couldn't.

01:47:54.974 --> 01:47:56.808
I really couldn't.

01:48:01.314 --> 01:48:02.939
I made some stew.

01:48:03.107 --> 01:48:06.401
It isn't much, but it's hot.

01:48:14.202 --> 01:48:16.244
Thank you.

01:48:36.766 --> 01:48:39.309
- It's good.
- Really?

01:48:43.272 --> 01:48:46.650
My uncle told me a strange thing.

01:48:47.944 --> 01:48:52.030
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

01:48:52.448 --> 01:48:54.950
But he must be mistaken.

01:48:55.159 --> 01:48:59.579
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

01:49:00.706 --> 01:49:03.959
Then you must be at least 60.

01:49:06.003 --> 01:49:07.587
Seventy?

01:49:08.005 --> 01:49:09.673
But you cannot be 80!

01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:14.386
Eighty-seven.

01:49:17.473 --> 01:49:19.599
You are one of the Dúnedain.

01:49:20.643 --> 01:49:23.770
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:27.607
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

01:49:28.276 --> 01:49:30.026
There are few of us left.

01:49:30.194 --> 01:49:33.029
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

01:49:33.781 --> 01:49:37.200
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

01:49:51.841 --> 01:49:56.011
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

01:49:56.762 --> 01:50:00.223
It is mine to give to whom I will.

01:50:02.018 --> 01:50:04.436
Like my heart.

01:50:05.855 --> 01:50:08.565
Go to sleep.

01:50:08.733 --> 01:50:11.234
I am asleep.

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.659
This is a dream.

01:50:21.871 --> 01:50:25.081
Then it is a good dream.

01:50:37.094 --> 01:50:39.179
Sleep.

01:51:03.673 --> 01:51:06.135
You told me once...

01:51:07.677 --> 01:51:10.781
this day would come.

01:51:10.879 --> 01:51:13.850
This is not the end... it is the beginning.

01:51:13.981 --> 01:51:16.553
You must go with Frodo.

01:51:16.554 --> 01:51:18.793
That is your path.

01:51:29.432 --> 01:51:31.351
My path is hidden from me.

01:51:32.701 --> 01:51:35.816
It is already laid before your feet.

01:51:36.539 --> 01:51:39.635
You cannot falter now.

01:51:42.159 --> 01:51:43.328
Arwen...

01:51:43.329 --> 01:51:44.401
Arwen...

01:51:46.049 --> 01:51:48.219
If you trust nothing else...

01:51:48.719 --> 01:51:50.629
trust this...

01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:54.897
trust us.

01:52:33.544 --> 01:52:35.378
Where is she?

01:52:36.547 --> 01:52:38.965
The woman who gave you that jewel.

01:52:42.303 --> 01:52:45.054
Our time here is ending.

01:52:45.723 --> 01:52:48.308
Arwen's time is ending.

01:52:49.018 --> 01:52:50.310
Let her go.

01:52:50.478 --> 01:52:52.479
Let her take the ship into the west.

01:52:52.646 --> 01:52:55.732
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:57.692
There it will be ever green.

01:52:59.195 --> 01:53:01.571
But never more than memory.

01:53:02.823 --> 01:53:05.867
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

01:53:06.076 --> 01:53:09.704
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

01:53:09.872 --> 01:53:12.207
She belongs with her people.

01:53:24.048 --> 01:53:26.931
Is this how you would take your leave?

01:53:27.152 --> 01:53:32.218
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

01:53:33.124 --> 01:53:35.263
I will not be coming back.

01:53:36.362 --> 01:53:38.585
You underestimate your skill in battle.

01:53:39.329 --> 01:53:40.703
You will come back.

01:53:40.929 --> 01:53:42.143
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

01:53:42.167 --> 01:53:44.470
Then what do you speak of?

01:53:49.774 --> 01:53:53.839
You have a chance for another life...

01:53:54.845 --> 01:53:59.620
away from war... grief... despair.

01:54:00.506 --> 01:54:02.340
Why are you saying this?

01:54:03.926 --> 01:54:07.095
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

01:54:08.556 --> 01:54:11.224
It was a dream, Arwen.

01:54:11.642 --> 01:54:13.017
Nothing more.

01:54:14.395 --> 01:54:17.605
I don't believe you.

01:54:26.615 --> 01:54:28.449
This belongs to you.

01:54:31.203 --> 01:54:32.787
It was a gift.

01:54:35.457 --> 01:54:36.958
Keep it.

01:54:39.461 --> 01:54:40.670
My lord?

01:54:43.465 --> 01:54:48.052
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

01:55:11.493 --> 01:55:12.994
What is it?

01:55:14.496 --> 01:55:16.539
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

01:55:33.098 --> 01:55:35.183
Wargs!

01:55:47.696 --> 01:55:49.364
A scout!

01:55:55.704 --> 01:55:58.206
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

01:55:59.541 --> 01:56:01.751
Get them out of here!

01:56:06.507 --> 01:56:08.549
All riders to the head of the column.

01:56:09.218 --> 01:56:11.219
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

01:56:11.387 --> 01:56:13.137
Come on!

01:56:24.942 --> 01:56:27.402
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

01:56:27.569 --> 01:56:29.070
- I can fight.
- No!

01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:33.825
You must do this, for me.

01:56:35.828 --> 01:56:37.412
Follow me! Hyah!

01:56:40.916 --> 01:56:45.253
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

01:56:45.421 --> 01:56:48.089
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

01:58:00.329 --> 01:58:02.622
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

01:58:05.417 --> 01:58:07.001
That one counts as mine!

01:58:23.685 --> 01:58:25.311
Stinking creature.

01:59:52.566 --> 01:59:54.442
Aragorn!

01:59:59.156 --> 02:00:00.615
Aragorn?

02:00:14.630 --> 02:00:17.548
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

02:00:17.716 --> 02:00:19.133
He's...

02:00:19.718 --> 02:00:21.302
dead.

02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:24.847
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

02:00:28.477 --> 02:00:29.769
You lie.

02:01:03.679 --> 02:01:05.304
Get the wounded on horses.

02:01:06.598 --> 02:01:09.767
The wolves of Isengard will return.

02:01:10.185 --> 02:01:12.311
Leave the dead.

02:01:19.695 --> 02:01:21.195
Come.

02:01:31.373 --> 02:01:32.999
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

02:01:33.166 --> 02:01:36.043
There it is, Helm's Deep.

02:01:38.588 --> 02:01:40.423
We're safe!

02:01:41.925 --> 02:01:44.802
We're safe, my lady.

02:01:44.970 --> 02:01:46.178
Thank you.

02:02:30.515 --> 02:02:31.932
- Mama!
- Éothain!

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:33.642
Freda!

02:02:39.399 --> 02:02:42.234
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

02:02:46.073 --> 02:02:47.406
Take it to the caves.

02:02:47.574 --> 02:02:50.409
Make way for the king.

02:02:52.287 --> 02:02:55.247
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

02:03:03.131 --> 02:03:06.884
So few. So few of you have returned.

02:03:09.638 --> 02:03:11.931
Our people are safe.

02:03:13.266 --> 02:03:15.810
We have paid for it with many lives.

02:03:16.645 --> 02:03:18.187
My lady.

02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:24.151
Lord Aragorn...

02:03:24.319 --> 02:03:25.569
where is he?

02:03:27.572 --> 02:03:29.115
He fell.

02:03:51.805 --> 02:03:54.765
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

02:03:54.933 --> 02:03:57.852
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

02:03:58.103 --> 02:04:01.188
What of those who cannot
fight, my lord? The women and children?

02:04:01.356 --> 02:04:03.983
Get them into the caves.

02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:09.697
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

02:04:11.741 --> 02:04:15.161
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

02:04:15.328 --> 02:04:17.663
Its outer wall is solid rock...

02:04:17.831 --> 02:04:20.916
but for a small culvert
at its base...

02:04:21.084 --> 02:04:23.878
which is little more than a drain.

02:04:26.715 --> 02:04:30.885
How? How can fire undo stone?

02:04:31.052 --> 02:04:35.598
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

02:04:39.227 --> 02:04:43.230
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

02:04:43.398 --> 02:04:46.901
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

02:04:47.068 --> 02:04:49.653
thousands, to storm the Keep.

02:04:49.821 --> 02:04:51.238
Tens of thousands.

02:04:51.406 --> 02:04:55.492
But, my lord, there is no such force.

02:05:07.422 --> 02:05:10.507
A new power is rising.

02:05:10.675 --> 02:05:13.677
Its victory is at hand.

02:05:19.351 --> 02:05:21.435
This night...

02:05:21.853 --> 02:05:26.190
the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

02:05:26.358 --> 02:05:29.693
March to Helm's Deep!

02:05:29.861 --> 02:05:33.364
Leave none alive!

02:05:35.867 --> 02:05:38.369
To war!

02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:46.752
There will be no dawn for Men.

02:06:03.937 --> 02:06:05.980
Look. There's smoke to the south.

02:06:06.147 --> 02:06:09.316
There is always smoke rising...

02:06:09.526 --> 02:06:13.362
from Isengard these days.

02:06:13.613 --> 02:06:15.197
Isengard?

02:06:15.407 --> 02:06:17.283
There was a time...

02:06:17.617 --> 02:06:21.161
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

02:06:21.329 --> 02:06:24.665
But now he has a mind of metal...

02:06:25.333 --> 02:06:27.793
and wheels.

02:06:28.545 --> 02:06:33.048
He no longer cares for growing things.

02:06:33.216 --> 02:06:35.009
What is it?

02:06:40.015 --> 02:06:42.224
It's Saruman's army.

02:06:42.392 --> 02:06:43.976
The war has started.

02:07:22.265 --> 02:07:26.643
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

02:07:58.927 --> 02:08:00.803
Brego.

02:08:26.913 --> 02:08:28.080
Arwen.

02:08:27.096 --> 02:08:28.809
Arwen.

02:08:29.531 --> 02:08:31.719
It is time.

02:08:33.002 --> 02:08:37.965
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.

02:08:37.966 --> 02:08:39.758
I have made my choice.

02:08:46.182 --> 02:08:49.059
He is not coming back.

02:08:50.478 --> 02:08:53.814
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

02:08:54.732 --> 02:08:57.734
There is still hope.

02:09:01.865 --> 02:09:05.659
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

02:09:09.038 --> 02:09:11.999
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

02:09:12.167 --> 02:09:14.668
and all that you hope for
comes true...

02:09:14.836 --> 02:09:19.548
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:22.843
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

02:09:23.011 --> 02:09:25.929
Aragorn will die.

02:09:28.766 --> 02:09:31.351
And there will be no comfort
for you...

02:09:31.519 --> 02:09:35.731
no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

02:09:38.526 --> 02:09:41.278
He will come to death...

02:09:41.446 --> 02:09:44.031
an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

02:09:44.199 --> 02:09:48.869
in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

02:09:57.962 --> 02:10:01.924
But you, my daughter...

02:10:02.717 --> 02:10:07.763
you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:12.017
as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

02:10:14.395 --> 02:10:16.813
Here you will dwell...

02:10:16.981 --> 02:10:21.902
bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

02:10:23.613 --> 02:10:25.614
until all the world is changed...

02:10:25.782 --> 02:10:30.285
and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

02:10:38.836 --> 02:10:40.003
Arwen.

02:10:46.636 --> 02:10:48.929
There is nothing for you here...

02:10:49.597 --> 02:10:51.682
only death.

02:11:11.895 --> 02:11:15.729
Do I not also have your love?

02:11:16.634 --> 02:11:20.326
You do have my love, father.

02:12:10.635 --> 02:12:12.597
The world is changed.

02:12:13.777 --> 02:12:15.847
I feel it in the water.

02:12:16.070 --> 02:12:18.584
I feel it in the earth,

02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:22.660
I smell it in the air.

02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:28.737
The power of the enemy is growing.

02:12:28.905 --> 02:12:31.531
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

02:12:31.699 --> 02:12:35.160
to destroy the people of Rohan.

02:12:37.205 --> 02:12:40.874
Isengard has been unleashed.

02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:48.548
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

02:12:49.676 --> 02:12:52.678
the last free kingdom of Men.

02:12:52.845 --> 02:12:57.224
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

02:13:00.937 --> 02:13:04.064
He senses the Ring is close.

02:13:04.232 --> 02:13:07.693
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:11.905
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

02:13:13.449 --> 02:13:17.327
the quest will claim his life.

02:13:17.495 --> 02:13:19.663
You know this.

02:13:20.248 --> 02:13:23.083
You have foreseen it.

02:13:25.211 --> 02:13:28.672
It is the risk we all took.

02:13:33.052 --> 02:13:37.264
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

02:13:38.433 --> 02:13:42.853
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:48.483
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

02:13:48.693 --> 02:13:52.279
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

02:13:52.447 --> 02:13:56.533
take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

02:13:58.953 --> 02:14:00.787
It is close now.

02:14:00.955 --> 02:14:05.208
So close to achieving its goal.

02:14:08.296 --> 02:14:11.965
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

02:14:12.133 --> 02:14:16.261
even unto the ending
of the world.

02:14:18.097 --> 02:14:19.931
The time of the Elves...

02:14:20.141 --> 02:14:22.058
is over.

02:14:22.894 --> 02:14:26.480
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

02:14:28.441 --> 02:14:31.693
Do we let them stand alone?

02:14:36.324 --> 02:14:37.657
What news?

02:14:37.825 --> 02:14:40.660
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

02:14:40.828 --> 02:14:43.663
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

02:14:43.831 --> 02:14:47.876
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

02:14:48.044 --> 02:14:50.462
Sauron is marshaling an army.

02:14:50.797 --> 02:14:52.923
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

02:14:53.090 --> 02:14:56.510
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

02:14:57.595 --> 02:15:01.181
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

02:15:01.349 --> 02:15:04.392
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

02:15:06.521 --> 02:15:08.688
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

02:15:08.856 --> 02:15:11.566
Sauron from Mordor.

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:16.112
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:17.989
Gondor is weak.

02:15:18.157 --> 02:15:21.284
Sauron will strike us soon.

02:15:22.036 --> 02:15:23.870
And he will strike hard.

02:15:24.330 --> 02:15:28.416
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

02:15:42.348 --> 02:15:44.558
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

02:15:44.725 --> 02:15:47.477
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

02:15:47.645 --> 02:15:49.896
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

02:15:56.779 --> 02:15:58.530
Speak.

02:15:59.615 --> 02:16:02.242
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

02:16:02.577 --> 02:16:05.579
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

02:16:05.997 --> 02:16:07.539
Your bodyguard?

02:16:07.707 --> 02:16:09.499
His gardener.

02:16:10.084 --> 02:16:12.085
And where is your skulking friend?

02:16:13.588 --> 02:16:15.922
That gangrel creature.

02:16:16.257 --> 02:16:18.216
He had an ill-favored look.

02:16:19.927 --> 02:16:21.845
There was no other.

02:16:25.933 --> 02:16:28.268
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

02:16:31.606 --> 02:16:34.691
One we lost in Moria...

02:16:35.776 --> 02:16:37.277
two were my kin...

02:16:37.445 --> 02:16:41.197
a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

02:16:41.365 --> 02:16:45.285
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

02:16:50.291 --> 02:16:52.042
You're a friend of Boromir?

02:16:54.462 --> 02:16:55.962
Yes.

02:16:57.048 --> 02:16:58.131
For my part.

02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:07.599
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

02:17:09.644 --> 02:17:11.102
Dead?

02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:13.313
How? When?

02:17:13.564 --> 02:17:16.232
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

02:17:16.525 --> 02:17:20.362
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

02:17:23.115 --> 02:17:29.579
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

02:17:29.789 --> 02:17:32.874
It was cloven in two.

02:17:34.543 --> 02:17:37.963
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

02:17:40.007 --> 02:17:41.800
He was my brother.

02:18:30.683 --> 02:18:33.727
Boromir!

02:18:34.228 --> 02:18:36.104
Boromir!

02:18:40.359 --> 02:18:44.112
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:47.949
A place of light and beauty and music.

02:18:48.117 --> 02:18:50.452
And so it shall be once more!

02:18:52.997 --> 02:18:55.665
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

02:18:55.833 --> 02:19:00.211
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

02:19:04.008 --> 02:19:09.679
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

02:19:10.056 --> 02:19:15.018
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

02:19:23.736 --> 02:19:26.488
Good speech. Nice and short.

02:19:26.655 --> 02:19:29.574
Leaves more time for drinking!

02:19:29.867 --> 02:19:34.120
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

02:19:37.583 --> 02:19:39.751
Remember today, little brother.

02:19:39.919 --> 02:19:42.921
Today, life is good.

02:19:47.093 --> 02:19:48.676
What?

02:19:49.053 --> 02:19:50.512
He's here.

02:19:53.724 --> 02:19:56.768
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Where is he?

02:19:56.936 --> 02:20:00.396
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:02.649
Father!

02:20:07.488 --> 02:20:09.864
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

02:20:10.032 --> 02:20:13.451
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

02:20:14.912 --> 02:20:17.831
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

02:20:18.624 --> 02:20:20.917
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

02:20:21.085 --> 02:20:23.128
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

02:20:23.295 --> 02:20:25.004
Oh, too few.

02:20:25.506 --> 02:20:27.882
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

02:20:30.094 --> 02:20:33.179
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

02:20:33.347 --> 02:20:35.598
That is not my intent.

02:20:35.766 --> 02:20:39.519
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

02:20:42.898 --> 02:20:45.817
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

02:20:45.985 --> 02:20:48.736
I know his uses, and they are few.

02:20:48.904 --> 02:20:52.532
We have more urgent things to speak of.

02:20:53.701 --> 02:20:56.119
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

02:20:56.287 --> 02:20:59.164
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

02:20:59.331 --> 02:21:03.126
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

02:21:05.337 --> 02:21:07.630
The One Ring.

02:21:10.384 --> 02:21:15.054
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

02:21:15.222 --> 02:21:18.850
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

02:21:19.018 --> 02:21:23.146
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:27.609
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

02:21:27.776 --> 02:21:31.487
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

02:21:31.655 --> 02:21:35.617
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

02:21:35.784 --> 02:21:41.080
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

02:21:41.248 --> 02:21:46.336
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

02:21:46.503 --> 02:21:48.004
He will return.

02:21:48.172 --> 02:21:51.925
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

02:21:52.092 --> 02:21:54.636
You must go.

02:21:55.804 --> 02:21:57.931
Bring me back this mighty gift.

02:21:58.766 --> 02:22:04.270
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

02:22:04.438 --> 02:22:08.107
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

02:22:08.275 --> 02:22:11.277
send me in his stead.
- You?

02:22:12.446 --> 02:22:14.364
Oh, I see.

02:22:14.531 --> 02:22:18.743
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:21.162
I think not.

02:22:21.330 --> 02:22:24.207
I trust this mission only to your brother.

02:22:24.375 --> 02:22:27.293
The one who will not fail me.

02:22:44.436 --> 02:22:47.605
Remember today, little brother.

02:23:05.958 --> 02:23:07.959
Captain Faramir!

02:23:09.211 --> 02:23:11.337
We found the third one.

02:23:22.850 --> 02:23:24.851
You must come with me. Now.

02:23:36.071 --> 02:23:37.196
Down there.

02:23:52.087 --> 02:23:54.964
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

02:24:05.559 --> 02:24:07.060
They wait for my command.

02:24:12.566 --> 02:24:13.649
Shall I shoot?

02:24:14.902 --> 02:24:17.904
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

02:24:18.072 --> 02:24:19.906
So juicy sweet

02:24:20.574 --> 02:24:23.534
Our only wish To catch a fish

02:24:23.702 --> 02:24:26.412
So juicy sweet

02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:34.796
Wait.

02:24:36.298 --> 02:24:39.133
This creature is bound to me.

02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:41.677
And I to him.

02:24:44.932 --> 02:24:46.265
He is our guide.

02:24:50.979 --> 02:24:52.397
Please...

02:24:52.564 --> 02:24:54.440
let me go down to him.

02:25:05.702 --> 02:25:07.370
Sméagol.

02:25:08.372 --> 02:25:10.623
Master is here.

02:25:11.792 --> 02:25:12.959
Come, Sméagol.

02:25:15.796 --> 02:25:18.464
Trust master. Come.

02:25:21.635 --> 02:25:25.471
We must go now?

02:25:25.806 --> 02:25:29.267
Sméagol, you must trust master.

02:25:29.435 --> 02:25:30.810
Follow me. Come on.

02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.646
Come.

02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:37.316
Come, Sméagol.

02:25:37.818 --> 02:25:39.902
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

02:25:40.404 --> 02:25:41.946
Come on.

02:25:46.326 --> 02:25:47.994
Don't hurt him!

02:25:48.162 --> 02:25:50.913
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

02:25:51.081 --> 02:25:52.373
Master!

02:26:17.566 --> 02:26:19.942
That's enough.

02:26:23.572 --> 02:26:25.740
Where are you leading them?

02:26:27.534 --> 02:26:29.202
Answer me.

02:26:30.037 --> 02:26:33.247
Sméagol.

02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:41.464
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

02:26:42.716 --> 02:26:45.343
Cruel Men hurts us.

02:26:45.511 --> 02:26:48.513
Master tricksed us.

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:52.225
Of course he did.

02:26:52.601 --> 02:26:56.312
I told you he was tricksy.

02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:59.524
I told you he was false.

02:26:59.691 --> 02:27:02.401
Master is our friend.

02:27:02.569 --> 02:27:04.904
Our friend.

02:27:05.072 --> 02:27:07.240
Master betrayed us.

02:27:07.407 --> 02:27:10.409
No. Not its business.

02:27:11.495 --> 02:27:13.913
Leave us alone!

02:27:14.081 --> 02:27:16.499
Filthy little Hobbitses!

02:27:16.667 --> 02:27:18.960
They stole it from us!

02:27:19.127 --> 02:27:20.586
No. No.

02:27:21.129 --> 02:27:22.755
What did they steal?

02:27:24.925 --> 02:27:30.263
My precious!

02:27:33.934 --> 02:27:35.601
We have to get out of here.

02:27:36.186 --> 02:27:38.145
You go. Go, now.

02:27:40.774 --> 02:27:42.608
You can do it.

02:27:44.069 --> 02:27:45.528
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

02:27:45.696 --> 02:27:47.488
Just this once.

02:27:47.656 --> 02:27:49.448
Put it on.

02:27:49.866 --> 02:27:51.909
Disappear.

02:27:52.953 --> 02:27:54.036
I can't.

02:27:57.124 --> 02:27:59.333
You were right, Sam.

02:28:00.794 --> 02:28:03.296
You tried to tell me but...

02:28:07.968 --> 02:28:10.136
I'm sorry.

02:28:14.683 --> 02:28:17.560
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

02:28:18.979 --> 02:28:20.646
If I put it on...

02:28:20.814 --> 02:28:23.149
he'll find me.

02:28:24.818 --> 02:28:26.777
He'll see.

02:28:27.988 --> 02:28:29.989
Mr. Frodo...

02:28:34.911 --> 02:28:39.165
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

02:28:41.376 --> 02:28:44.378
Here in the Wild I have you...

02:28:44.546 --> 02:28:46.464
two Halflings...

02:28:46.632 --> 02:28:49.800
and a host of men at my call.

02:28:53.096 --> 02:28:56.599
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

02:29:06.276 --> 02:29:10.029
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

02:29:11.615 --> 02:29:14.659
to show his quality.

02:29:35.764 --> 02:29:37.390
No!

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.894
Stop it!

02:29:42.062 --> 02:29:43.104
Leave him alone.

02:29:44.439 --> 02:29:46.941
Don't you understand?

02:29:48.235 --> 02:29:50.152
He's got to destroy it!

02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:53.572
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

02:29:53.740 --> 02:29:55.408
To the Mountain of Fire!

02:29:56.451 --> 02:29:59.578
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

02:29:59.746 --> 02:30:02.748
Please. It's such a burden.

02:30:04.918 --> 02:30:07.002
Will you not help him?

02:30:08.338 --> 02:30:10.256
Captain?

02:30:10.924 --> 02:30:13.134
Prepare to leave.

02:30:18.098 --> 02:30:20.516
The Ring will go to Gondor.

02:31:33.507 --> 02:31:36.175
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

02:31:36.343 --> 02:31:39.386
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

02:31:39.554 --> 02:31:43.349
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

02:31:43.517 --> 02:31:47.520
and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

02:31:48.188 --> 02:31:49.688
Bless you, laddie.

02:31:50.273 --> 02:31:52.024
Gimli, where is the king?

02:32:00.694 --> 02:32:02.442
You're late.

02:32:05.789 --> 02:32:07.122
You look terrible.

02:32:48.874 --> 02:32:50.916
A great host, you say?

02:32:51.084 --> 02:32:52.543
All Isengard is emptied.

02:32:52.711 --> 02:32:53.752
How many?

02:32:54.421 --> 02:32:57.423
Ten thousand strong at least.

02:32:58.967 --> 02:33:00.426
Ten thousand?

02:33:00.844 --> 02:33:03.345
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

02:33:06.016 --> 02:33:08.142
To destroy the world of Men.

02:33:10.645 --> 02:33:12.646
They will be here by nightfall.

02:33:18.486 --> 02:33:19.778
Let them come!

02:33:21.281 --> 02:33:24.074
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

02:33:24.242 --> 02:33:27.369
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

02:33:35.629 --> 02:33:38.547
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

02:33:38.715 --> 02:33:41.133
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

02:33:41.301 --> 02:33:44.053
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:46.639
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

02:33:47.223 --> 02:33:49.433
These are Uruk-hai.

02:33:49.601 --> 02:33:53.020
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

02:33:54.648 --> 02:33:58.317
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

02:33:58.485 --> 02:34:02.112
I know how to defend my own keep.

02:34:08.703 --> 02:34:12.122
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:17.503
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

02:34:17.712 --> 02:34:20.381
Crops can be resown...

02:34:20.548 --> 02:34:23.550
homes rebuilt.

02:34:24.177 --> 02:34:26.720
Within these walls...

02:34:27.097 --> 02:34:28.597
we will outlast them.

02:34:28.765 --> 02:34:31.183
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

02:34:31.351 --> 02:34:32.893
They come to destroy its people...

02:34:33.061 --> 02:34:35.562
down to the last child.

02:34:36.439 --> 02:34:38.691
What would you have me do?

02:34:38.858 --> 02:34:40.609
Look at my men.

02:34:40.777 --> 02:34:42.528
Their courage hangs by a thread.

02:34:44.698 --> 02:34:49.118
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

02:34:49.285 --> 02:34:52.329
as to be worthy of remembrance.

02:34:55.959 --> 02:34:57.876
Send out riders, my lord.

02:34:58.169 --> 02:35:01.046
You must call for aid.

02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:06.552
And who will come?

02:35:06.970 --> 02:35:08.554
Elves?

02:35:08.722 --> 02:35:10.806
Dwarves?

02:35:11.558 --> 02:35:14.435
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:17.563
The old alliances are dead.

02:35:17.981 --> 02:35:20.774
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

02:35:20.942 --> 02:35:23.152
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

02:35:24.112 --> 02:35:27.364
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

02:35:27.532 --> 02:35:29.450
Where was Gon...?

02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:34.079
No, my Lord Aragorn...

02:35:35.665 --> 02:35:38.125
we are alone.

02:35:45.008 --> 02:35:46.759
Get the women and children
into the caves.

02:35:46.926 --> 02:35:48.320
We need more time
to lay provisions...

02:35:48.344 --> 02:35:51.847
There is no time. War is upon us.

02:35:52.098 --> 02:35:53.807
Secure the gate.

02:35:59.022 --> 02:36:01.106
We Ents have not troubled...

02:36:01.316 --> 02:36:04.693
about the wars of Men and wizards...

02:36:05.445 --> 02:36:08.447
for a very long time.

02:36:09.699 --> 02:36:14.453
But now, something
is about to happen...

02:36:14.621 --> 02:36:16.955
that has not happened...

02:36:17.165 --> 02:36:19.625
for an age.

02:36:20.835 --> 02:36:23.128
Entmoot.

02:36:23.505 --> 02:36:24.546
What's that?

02:36:24.964 --> 02:36:27.800
'Tis a gathering.

02:36:28.968 --> 02:36:31.553
A gathering of what?

02:36:49.489 --> 02:36:51.824
Beech. Oak.

02:36:51.991 --> 02:36:53.909
Chestnut. Ash.

02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:56.161
Good. Good. Good.

02:36:56.329 --> 02:36:58.664
Many have come.

02:37:06.214 --> 02:37:09.007
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

02:37:09.175 --> 02:37:11.718
will go to war.

02:37:20.687 --> 02:37:23.730
Move back! Move to the caves!

02:37:26.192 --> 02:37:28.277
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

02:37:28.695 --> 02:37:30.988
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

02:37:31.156 --> 02:37:33.448
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

02:37:33.616 --> 02:37:36.743
Aragorn, you must rest.

02:37:36.911 --> 02:37:38.412
You're no use to us half alive.

02:37:39.789 --> 02:37:40.998
Aragorn!

02:37:44.377 --> 02:37:47.421
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

02:37:47.589 --> 02:37:49.256
That is an honorable charge.

02:37:49.424 --> 02:37:52.301
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

02:37:52.468 --> 02:37:54.178
What renown is there in that?

02:37:54.345 --> 02:37:58.056
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

02:37:58.308 --> 02:38:01.101
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

02:38:01.269 --> 02:38:06.273
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

02:38:06.566 --> 02:38:09.401
You do not command
the others to stay!

02:38:09.569 --> 02:38:13.322
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

02:38:14.490 --> 02:38:16.700
Because they love you.

02:38:23.791 --> 02:38:25.334
I'm sorry.

02:39:31.234 --> 02:39:34.528
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

02:39:35.613 --> 02:39:37.406
These are no soldiers.

02:39:39.659 --> 02:39:43.161
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

02:39:47.083 --> 02:39:50.002
Look at them. They're frightened.

02:39:50.169 --> 02:39:51.628
I can see it in their eyes.

02:39:56.310 --> 02:39:57.619
And they should be...

02:39:58.476 --> 02:40:02.400
Three hundred... against ten thousand!

02:40:03.318 --> 02:40:06.101
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras...

02:40:06.102 --> 02:40:07.198
Aragorn.

02:40:07.199 --> 02:40:10.507
This is a battle they cannot win.

02:40:10.556 --> 02:40:12.566
They are all going to die!

02:40:12.567 --> 02:40:14.776
Then I shall die as one of them!

02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:23.035
Let him go, lad.

02:40:23.619 --> 02:40:25.537
Let him be.

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:32.544
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

02:40:36.799 --> 02:40:38.717
My lord?

02:40:40.762 --> 02:40:43.347
Who am I, Gamling?

02:40:46.726 --> 02:40:50.604
You are our king, sire.

02:40:53.608 --> 02:40:56.902
And do you trust your king?

02:40:58.404 --> 02:41:01.573
Your men, my lord...

02:41:01.741 --> 02:41:04.576
will follow you to whatever end.

02:41:11.417 --> 02:41:13.335
To whatever end.

02:41:23.179 --> 02:41:26.765
Where is the horse and the rider?

02:41:26.933 --> 02:41:29.976
Where is the horn that was blowing?

02:41:31.479 --> 02:41:35.941
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

02:41:36.943 --> 02:41:40.153
Like wind in the meadow.

02:41:43.825 --> 02:41:47.619
The days have gone down in the West...

02:41:48.287 --> 02:41:50.956
behind the hills...

02:41:52.834 --> 02:41:54.459
into Shadow.

02:42:02.927 --> 02:42:06.346
How did it come to this?

02:42:22.655 --> 02:42:24.281
Huh?

02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.494
It's been going for hours.

02:42:30.663 --> 02:42:33.081
They must have decided something
by now.

02:42:33.249 --> 02:42:37.335
Decided? No.

02:42:37.503 --> 02:42:42.674
We only just finished saying...

02:42:43.843 --> 02:42:45.719
good morning.

02:42:47.054 --> 02:42:50.265
But it's nighttime already.

02:42:50.433 --> 02:42:52.225
You can't take forever.

02:42:53.227 --> 02:42:55.312
Don't be hasty.

02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:58.148
We're running out of time!

02:43:01.194 --> 02:43:04.112
Move! Move to the outer wall.

02:43:21.672 --> 02:43:23.006
Give me your sword.

02:43:32.475 --> 02:43:33.683
What is your name?

02:43:34.227 --> 02:43:36.561
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

02:43:38.731 --> 02:43:41.358
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

02:43:43.319 --> 02:43:45.278
They say that it is hopeless.

02:44:03.089 --> 02:44:04.756
This is a good sword.

02:44:06.759 --> 02:44:09.094
Haleth, son of Háma...

02:44:13.432 --> 02:44:15.600
there is always hope.

02:44:38.583 --> 02:44:41.960
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

02:44:42.128 --> 02:44:43.670
Forgive me.

02:44:43.838 --> 02:44:45.297
I was wrong to despair.

02:44:47.905 --> 02:44:50.672
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:57.309
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

02:45:00.730 --> 02:45:02.814
It's a little tight across the chest.

02:45:08.988 --> 02:45:10.947
That is no Orc horn.

02:45:16.621 --> 02:45:18.455
Send for the king.

02:45:18.623 --> 02:45:22.208
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

02:45:53.866 --> 02:45:55.533
How is this possible?

02:45:56.535 --> 02:46:00.205
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

02:46:00.373 --> 02:46:03.583
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

02:46:04.293 --> 02:46:08.546
Long ago we fought and died together.

02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:13.718
We come to honor that allegiance.

02:46:22.186 --> 02:46:24.104
You are most welcome.

02:46:29.485 --> 02:46:33.279
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

02:47:07.064 --> 02:47:10.316
You could have picked a better spot.

02:47:15.156 --> 02:47:19.367
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

02:47:25.499 --> 02:47:27.292
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

02:47:27.918 --> 02:47:30.420
Let's hope they last the night.

02:48:30.930 --> 02:48:33.444
Show them no mercy...

02:48:34.634 --> 02:48:37.838
for you shall receive none!

02:49:11.856 --> 02:49:14.691
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

02:49:15.943 --> 02:49:17.735
Or would you like me to find you a box?

02:49:57.651 --> 02:49:58.895
Hold!

02:50:20.925 --> 02:50:22.759
So it begins.

02:50:28.182 --> 02:50:30.294
Prepare to fire!

02:50:38.293 --> 02:50:41.398
Their armour is weak at the neck...

02:50:41.462 --> 02:50:42.650
and beneath the arm.

02:50:42.663 --> 02:50:44.989
Release arrows!

02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:50.954
Did they hit anything?

02:50:51.622 --> 02:50:53.623
Give them a volley.

02:50:53.791 --> 02:50:55.917
- Fire!
- Fire!

02:51:11.642 --> 02:51:13.309
Send them to me! Come on!

02:51:32.380 --> 02:51:34.122
Ladders!

02:51:34.123 --> 02:51:35.164
Good!

02:51:41.964 --> 02:51:44.966
Swords! Swords!

02:52:23.047 --> 02:52:25.173
Legolas! Two already!

02:52:25.340 --> 02:52:27.467
I'm on 17!

02:52:27.634 --> 02:52:30.219
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

02:52:37.019 --> 02:52:38.728
Nineteen!

02:53:04.713 --> 02:53:06.130
Merry.

02:53:10.552 --> 02:53:14.347
We have just agreed.

02:53:24.358 --> 02:53:25.817
Yes?

02:53:27.319 --> 02:53:31.489
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

02:53:32.616 --> 02:53:35.868
and we have agreed...

02:53:36.328 --> 02:53:40.373
you are not Orcs.

02:53:42.126 --> 02:53:44.252
Well, that's good news.

02:53:44.419 --> 02:53:48.548
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

02:53:49.174 --> 02:53:52.969
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

02:53:53.137 --> 02:53:54.679
Hasty?

02:53:55.472 --> 02:53:57.348
Our friends are out there.

02:53:57.516 --> 02:54:01.686
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:04.313
War? Yes.

02:54:04.481 --> 02:54:06.357
It affects us all.

02:54:06.525 --> 02:54:09.527
Tree, root and twig.

02:54:10.404 --> 02:54:14.448
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

02:54:14.658 --> 02:54:16.576
it takes a long time...

02:54:16.743 --> 02:54:21.664
to say anything in Old Entish...

02:54:21.832 --> 02:54:26.043
and we never say anything...

02:54:26.211 --> 02:54:30.131
unless it is worth taking...

02:54:30.299 --> 02:54:34.343
a long time to say.

02:54:35.137 --> 02:54:38.431
Seventeen! Eighteen!

02:54:38.599 --> 02:54:39.682
Nineteen!

02:54:40.225 --> 02:54:42.101
Twenty!

02:54:42.269 --> 02:54:43.936
Twenty-one!

02:54:54.031 --> 02:54:55.072
Causeway!

02:55:03.790 --> 02:55:06.167
Is this it?

02:55:06.335 --> 02:55:09.253
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

02:55:35.093 --> 02:55:37.402
Bring him down, Legolas!

02:55:39.531 --> 02:55:40.944
Kill him!

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.431
Kill him!

02:56:35.257 --> 02:56:36.632
Brace the gate!

02:56:54.943 --> 02:56:57.194
Hold them! Stand firm!

02:57:05.078 --> 02:57:06.412
Aragorn!

02:57:11.043 --> 02:57:12.251
Gimli!

02:57:23.334 --> 02:57:25.082
Charge!

02:58:01.009 --> 02:58:04.929
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

02:58:05.722 --> 02:58:09.725
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:12.645
How can that be your decision?!

02:58:13.313 --> 02:58:16.941
This is not our war.

02:58:17.234 --> 02:58:19.443
But you're part of this world!

02:58:23.573 --> 02:58:25.408
Aren't you?!

02:58:29.496 --> 02:58:31.872
You must help. Please.

02:58:33.166 --> 02:58:35.918
You must do something.

02:58:36.211 --> 02:58:40.506
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

02:58:41.716 --> 02:58:45.428
But your part in this tale is over.

02:58:45.595 --> 02:58:47.847
Go back to your home.

02:58:57.858 --> 02:59:00.109
Maybe Treebeard's right.

02:59:00.277 --> 02:59:02.153
We don't belong here, Merry.

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:04.613
It's too big for us.

02:59:04.781 --> 02:59:07.450
What can we do in the end?

02:59:09.744 --> 02:59:12.371
We've got the Shire.

02:59:12.914 --> 02:59:15.458
Maybe we should go home.

02:59:17.294 --> 02:59:20.504
The fires of Isengard will spread...

02:59:20.672 --> 02:59:25.593
and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:27.344
And...

02:59:29.139 --> 02:59:32.224
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

02:59:35.770 --> 02:59:38.689
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

02:59:58.210 --> 02:59:59.460
Aragorn!

02:59:59.628 --> 03:00:02.004
Fall back to the Keep!

03:00:02.172 --> 03:00:05.257
Get your men out of there!

03:00:06.127 --> 03:00:07.596
Fall back!

03:00:14.893 --> 03:00:16.560
Haldir!

03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:23.943
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

03:00:24.878 --> 03:00:26.284
Back to the Keep!

03:00:43.171 --> 03:00:44.380
Haldir!

03:01:27.090 --> 03:01:28.591
Brace the gate!

03:01:30.802 --> 03:01:32.094
Hold them!

03:01:33.930 --> 03:01:37.308
To the gate. Draw your swords!

03:02:05.462 --> 03:02:07.379
Make way!

03:02:10.300 --> 03:02:12.009
We cannot hold much longer!

03:02:17.974 --> 03:02:21.560
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

03:02:21.728 --> 03:02:24.313
As long as you can give me.

03:02:24.481 --> 03:02:26.148
Gimli!

03:02:27.609 --> 03:02:28.984
Timbers!

03:02:29.152 --> 03:02:31.111
Brace the gate!

03:02:45.877 --> 03:02:47.586
Come on. We can take them.

03:02:48.421 --> 03:02:50.047
It's a long way.

03:02:55.303 --> 03:02:57.054
Toss me.

03:02:58.223 --> 03:03:00.057
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

03:03:00.225 --> 03:03:01.809
You'll have to toss me!

03:03:07.399 --> 03:03:08.691
Don't tell the Elf.

03:03:09.192 --> 03:03:10.984
Not a word.

03:03:26.209 --> 03:03:27.668
Shore up the door!

03:03:27.836 --> 03:03:29.920
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

03:03:30.088 --> 03:03:31.171
Watch our backs!

03:03:35.301 --> 03:03:37.553
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

03:04:27.479 --> 03:04:28.896
Hold fast the gate!

03:04:33.109 --> 03:04:36.069
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

03:04:40.784 --> 03:04:42.409
Aragorn!

03:05:15.819 --> 03:05:18.278
Pull everybody back.

03:05:18.655 --> 03:05:20.447
Pull them back.

03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:25.118
Fall back!

03:05:26.287 --> 03:05:27.871
They have broken through!

03:05:28.039 --> 03:05:30.415
The castle is breached. Retreat!

03:05:30.583 --> 03:05:32.835
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

03:05:33.002 --> 03:05:35.587
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

03:05:35.755 --> 03:05:38.006
Into the Keep!

03:05:49.477 --> 03:05:54.439
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

03:05:54.607 --> 03:05:59.319
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

03:06:05.034 --> 03:06:06.326
Wait! Stop!

03:06:07.203 --> 03:06:08.704
Stop!

03:06:11.833 --> 03:06:13.542
Turn around.

03:06:14.460 --> 03:06:17.170
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

03:06:17.338 --> 03:06:22.342
But that will lead you past Isengard.

03:06:22.677 --> 03:06:25.387
Yes. Exactly.

03:06:25.555 --> 03:06:28.765
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

03:06:28.933 --> 03:06:31.602
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

03:06:31.769 --> 03:06:33.770
It's the last thing he'll expect.

03:06:36.399 --> 03:06:39.401
That doesn't make sense to me.

03:06:39.569 --> 03:06:40.736
But then...

03:06:40.904 --> 03:06:43.614
you are very small.

03:06:44.073 --> 03:06:45.866
Perhaps you're right.

03:06:48.494 --> 03:06:50.037
South it is, then.

03:06:51.539 --> 03:06:54.875
Hold on, little Shirelings.

03:06:56.920 --> 03:06:59.671
I always like going south.

03:06:59.839 --> 03:07:04.134
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

03:07:04.761 --> 03:07:07.220
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

03:07:07.388 --> 03:07:09.306
No, we won't.

03:07:10.058 --> 03:07:12.309
Not this time.

03:07:18.942 --> 03:07:19.983
Look!

03:07:21.611 --> 03:07:24.071
Osgiliath burns!

03:07:24.238 --> 03:07:25.656
Mordor has come.

03:07:26.783 --> 03:07:29.201
The Ring will not save Gondor.

03:07:30.536 --> 03:07:32.746
It has only the power to destroy.

03:07:33.623 --> 03:07:35.082
Please...

03:07:35.249 --> 03:07:36.875
let me go.

03:07:37.919 --> 03:07:39.503
Hurry.

03:07:42.966 --> 03:07:44.383
Faramir!

03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:46.885
You must let me go!

03:07:47.470 --> 03:07:50.931
And those little family of field mice...

03:07:51.099 --> 03:07:53.934
that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

03:07:54.644 --> 03:07:57.980
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

03:08:09.158 --> 03:08:12.077
Many of these trees were my friends.

03:08:12.787 --> 03:08:17.416
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

03:08:18.584 --> 03:08:19.793
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

03:08:19.961 --> 03:08:22.713
They had voices of their own.

03:08:24.966 --> 03:08:27.509
Saruman.

03:08:27.844 --> 03:08:30.929
A wizard should know better!

03:08:45.194 --> 03:08:48.864
There is no curse in Elvish...

03:08:49.032 --> 03:08:51.700
Entish or the tongues of Men...

03:08:51.868 --> 03:08:54.202
for this treachery.

03:08:55.621 --> 03:08:58.457
Look! The trees! They're moving!

03:09:03.171 --> 03:09:04.379
Where are they going?

03:09:04.881 --> 03:09:08.133
They have business with the Orcs.

03:09:08.593 --> 03:09:12.888
My business is with Isengard tonight...

03:09:13.056 --> 03:09:15.682
with rock and stone.

03:09:39.582 --> 03:09:40.749
Yes.

03:09:41.834 --> 03:09:43.251
Come, my friends.

03:09:44.587 --> 03:09:48.799
The Ents are going to war.

03:09:48.966 --> 03:09:50.759
It is likely...

03:09:50.927 --> 03:09:54.429
that we go to our doom.

03:09:55.848 --> 03:09:58.308
Last march...

03:09:58.851 --> 03:10:00.894
of the Ents.

03:10:48.985 --> 03:10:52.737
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

03:10:52.905 --> 03:10:54.990
By nightfall we will be overrun.

03:10:57.743 --> 03:10:59.202
Mr. Frodo?

03:10:59.495 --> 03:11:03.623
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

03:11:03.791 --> 03:11:06.293
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:22.017
Take them to my father.

03:11:23.561 --> 03:11:26.563
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

03:11:28.983 --> 03:11:32.027
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

03:11:33.196 --> 03:11:35.864
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

03:11:36.532 --> 03:11:39.284
You want to know
why your brother died?

03:11:39.785 --> 03:11:43.538
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

03:11:43.706 --> 03:11:45.582
He tried to kill him!

03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:48.084
The Ring drove your brother mad!

03:11:48.878 --> 03:11:50.712
Watch out!

03:12:01.641 --> 03:12:02.766
Mr. Frodo?

03:12:05.394 --> 03:12:07.229
They're here.

03:12:10.358 --> 03:12:12.817
They've come.

03:12:15.404 --> 03:12:17.280
Nazgûl!

03:12:39.428 --> 03:12:41.596
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

03:12:43.391 --> 03:12:45.600
Take cover!

03:13:02.952 --> 03:13:04.494
The fortress is taken.

03:13:05.288 --> 03:13:06.454
It is over.

03:13:06.622 --> 03:13:10.583
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

03:13:10.751 --> 03:13:13.670
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

03:13:16.424 --> 03:13:17.799
They're breaking in!

03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:22.971
They're past the door!

03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:30.437
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

03:13:33.107 --> 03:13:35.025
Is there no other way?

03:13:36.610 --> 03:13:39.654
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

03:13:40.323 --> 03:13:42.532
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

03:13:47.413 --> 03:13:49.831
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

03:13:49.999 --> 03:13:52.834
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

03:13:55.004 --> 03:13:58.423
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

03:14:03.095 --> 03:14:04.512
Ride out with me.

03:14:08.642 --> 03:14:10.268
Ride out and meet them.

03:14:11.020 --> 03:14:13.188
For death and glory.

03:14:13.356 --> 03:14:14.773
For Rohan.

03:14:16.275 --> 03:14:17.734
For your people.

03:14:18.486 --> 03:14:20.403
The sun is rising.

03:14:24.909 --> 03:14:27.911
Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

03:14:28.079 --> 03:14:29.496
At dawn...

03:14:29.663 --> 03:14:31.373
look to the east.

03:14:35.544 --> 03:14:41.341
Yes.

03:14:42.676 --> 03:14:45.053
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

03:14:45.221 --> 03:14:48.056
shall sound in the Deep...

03:14:48.474 --> 03:14:50.475
one last time.

03:14:50.643 --> 03:14:52.143
Yes!

03:14:55.189 --> 03:14:58.983
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

03:15:06.742 --> 03:15:08.076
Fell deeds, awake.

03:15:09.286 --> 03:15:10.412
Now for wrath...

03:15:10.579 --> 03:15:13.957
now for ruin and a red dawn.

03:15:21.006 --> 03:15:23.258
Forth Eorlingas!

03:16:11.056 --> 03:16:12.307
Gandalf.

03:16:19.565 --> 03:16:23.234
Théoden King stands alone.

03:16:23.819 --> 03:16:25.987
Not alone.

03:16:26.405 --> 03:16:27.530
Rohirrim!

03:16:33.454 --> 03:16:34.621
Éomer.

03:16:34.788 --> 03:16:37.332
To the king!

03:17:54.910 --> 03:17:56.703
Yes!

03:18:05.838 --> 03:18:09.132
A hit. A fine hit.

03:18:33.824 --> 03:18:36.284
Break the dam!

03:18:36.452 --> 03:18:39.912
Release the river!

03:19:07.232 --> 03:19:09.984
Pippin! Hold on!

03:19:15.240 --> 03:19:18.159
Hold on, little Hobbits.

03:19:59.535 --> 03:20:01.536
What are you doing?

03:20:10.129 --> 03:20:11.713
Where are you going?

03:21:09.855 --> 03:21:11.189
It's me.

03:21:13.692 --> 03:21:15.902
It's your Sam.

03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:22.867
Don't you know your Sam?

03:21:40.594 --> 03:21:43.971
I can't do this, Sam.

03:21:44.848 --> 03:21:46.849
I know.

03:21:47.851 --> 03:21:50.228
It's all wrong.

03:21:50.979 --> 03:21:52.980
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

03:22:00.405 --> 03:22:02.490
But we are.

03:22:08.914 --> 03:22:11.958
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

03:22:12.125 --> 03:22:14.502
The ones that really mattered.

03:22:15.546 --> 03:22:18.548
Full of darkness and danger they were.

03:22:18.715 --> 03:22:21.676
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

03:22:21.844 --> 03:22:24.804
because how could the end be happy?

03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:29.559
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

03:22:29.726 --> 03:22:33.229
when so much bad had happened?

03:22:34.064 --> 03:22:35.982
Victory!

03:22:36.149 --> 03:22:37.692
We have victory!

03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:41.821
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

03:22:41.989 --> 03:22:43.322
this shadow.

03:22:43.490 --> 03:22:45.867
Even darkness must pass.

03:22:46.034 --> 03:22:48.744
A new day will come.

03:22:48.912 --> 03:22:52.874
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

03:22:54.793 --> 03:22:57.169
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

03:22:57.337 --> 03:22:59.088
that meant something.

03:22:59.256 --> 03:23:01.841
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

03:23:03.218 --> 03:23:07.054
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

03:23:07.222 --> 03:23:08.806
I know now.

03:23:09.641 --> 03:23:11.851
Folk in those stories...

03:23:12.019 --> 03:23:16.147
had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

03:23:16.315 --> 03:23:18.566
They kept going...

03:23:19.234 --> 03:23:22.486
because they were holding
on to something.

03:23:24.072 --> 03:23:26.407
What are we holding on to, Sam?

03:23:38.337 --> 03:23:42.256
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

03:23:42.549 --> 03:23:45.176
And it's worth fighting for.

03:24:12.079 --> 03:24:16.374
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

03:24:17.125 --> 03:24:21.087
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

03:24:21.254 --> 03:24:23.464
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

03:24:27.803 --> 03:24:29.220
Then it is forfeit.

03:24:31.974 --> 03:24:33.766
Release them.

03:24:45.821 --> 03:24:47.863
Stay out of the forest!

03:24:48.031 --> 03:24:49.824
Keep away from the trees!

03:25:40.667 --> 03:25:42.460
Final count...

03:25:42.627 --> 03:25:45.546
42.
- Forty-two?

03:25:45.714 --> 03:25:51.761
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

03:25:52.554 --> 03:25:56.223
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

03:26:00.353 --> 03:26:03.647
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

03:26:04.399 --> 03:26:06.901
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

03:26:07.069 --> 03:26:11.697
because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

03:26:13.992 --> 03:26:18.704
- He doesn't look happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

03:26:18.955 --> 03:26:22.500
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

03:26:22.667 --> 03:26:25.628
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

03:26:25.796 --> 03:26:28.631
I hear the staff are very good.

03:26:34.304 --> 03:26:36.680
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

03:26:36.848 --> 03:26:41.102
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:42.520
I'm starving.

03:26:42.687 --> 03:26:45.773
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

03:26:45.941 --> 03:26:49.026
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

03:27:12.968 --> 03:27:15.386
Saruman's storeroom!

03:27:17.722 --> 03:27:20.474
I don't believe it.

03:27:20.642 --> 03:27:22.685
It can't be.

03:27:23.311 --> 03:27:26.188
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

03:27:27.482 --> 03:27:29.817
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

03:27:30.152 --> 03:27:33.279
It's perfect. One barrel each.

03:27:33.446 --> 03:27:34.572
Wait.

03:27:35.323 --> 03:27:36.676
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:38.242
Share it?

03:27:40.078 --> 03:27:42.496
No. No.

03:27:43.999 --> 03:27:45.332
Dead plant and all that.

03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:47.918
Don't think he'd understand.

03:27:49.171 --> 03:27:51.380
Could be a distant relative.

03:27:52.174 --> 03:27:54.675
I get it.

03:27:54.843 --> 03:27:57.678
Don't be hasty.

03:27:58.763 --> 03:28:00.514
Exactly.

03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:03.851
Bar-hrum.

03:28:29.502 --> 03:28:30.794
This is the old sewer.

03:28:30.962 --> 03:28:34.089
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

03:28:34.257 --> 03:28:36.008
You'll find cover in the woods there.

03:28:37.052 --> 03:28:39.553
Captain Faramir...

03:28:40.180 --> 03:28:42.014
you have shown your quality, sir.

03:28:44.517 --> 03:28:45.809
The very highest.

03:28:46.311 --> 03:28:48.938
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

03:28:49.105 --> 03:28:52.066
where gardeners are held in high honor.

03:28:53.235 --> 03:28:55.236
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

03:28:55.820 --> 03:28:57.404
Gollum says there's a path...

03:28:57.572 --> 03:29:01.492
near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

03:29:01.952 --> 03:29:03.702
Cirith Ungol?

03:29:07.249 --> 03:29:09.792
- Is that its name?
- No.

03:29:09.960 --> 03:29:11.627
No!

03:29:12.462 --> 03:29:15.464
- Yes.
- Frodo...

03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:19.385
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

03:29:20.262 --> 03:29:22.805
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

03:29:23.139 --> 03:29:29.436
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

03:29:30.939 --> 03:29:32.731
I must.

03:29:36.278 --> 03:29:39.863
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

03:29:40.031 --> 03:29:42.074
Thank you.

03:29:53.878 --> 03:29:58.007
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

03:30:10.478 --> 03:30:12.021
Come on, keep up.

03:30:15.483 --> 03:30:18.277
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

03:30:18.903 --> 03:30:20.738
You know that, don't you?

03:30:21.531 --> 03:30:23.115
He was trying to save you, see?

03:30:23.616 --> 03:30:25.159
Save me?

03:30:25.493 --> 03:30:27.661
So there's no hard feelings.

03:30:27.829 --> 03:30:32.958
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

03:30:33.126 --> 03:30:35.753
Gollum, Gollum.

03:30:36.796 --> 03:30:38.547
Nice master.

03:30:39.632 --> 03:30:42.468
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

03:30:42.635 --> 03:30:44.928
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

03:30:50.435 --> 03:30:55.647
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

03:31:02.781 --> 03:31:05.783
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

03:31:06.451 --> 03:31:09.995
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

03:31:15.126 --> 03:31:18.545
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

03:31:19.547 --> 03:31:22.758
somewhere in the wilderness.

03:31:26.054 --> 03:31:29.473
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

03:31:29.641 --> 03:31:31.016
What?

03:31:31.184 --> 03:31:35.145
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

03:31:35.313 --> 03:31:38.565
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

03:31:38.733 --> 03:31:41.693
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

03:31:41.861 --> 03:31:43.529
"Yes, my boy.

03:31:43.696 --> 03:31:47.491
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

03:31:47.659 --> 03:31:50.202
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

03:31:50.370 --> 03:31:52.246
"Samwise the Brave."

03:31:52.414 --> 03:31:55.165
I want to hear more about Sam.

03:31:59.462 --> 03:32:02.464
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

03:32:03.800 --> 03:32:07.845
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

03:32:08.930 --> 03:32:10.305
So was I.

03:32:19.190 --> 03:32:21.900
"Samwise the Brave."

03:32:26.156 --> 03:32:27.489
Sméagol?

03:32:27.657 --> 03:32:30.576
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

03:32:30.743 --> 03:32:32.661
Master.

03:32:32.829 --> 03:32:35.789
Master looks after us.

03:32:36.583 --> 03:32:39.376
Master wouldn't hurt us.

03:32:39.544 --> 03:32:42.004
Master broke his promise.

03:32:42.172 --> 03:32:44.339
Don't ask Sméagol.

03:32:44.507 --> 03:32:47.718
Poor, poor Sméagol.

03:32:47.886 --> 03:32:50.721
Master betrayed us.

03:32:50.889 --> 03:32:53.974
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

03:32:54.142 --> 03:32:58.061
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

03:32:58.229 --> 03:33:00.981
Kill him! Kill him!

03:33:01.149 --> 03:33:02.649
Kill them both!

03:33:02.817 --> 03:33:06.445
And then we take the precious...

03:33:06.613 --> 03:33:10.157
and we be the master!

03:33:10.825 --> 03:33:13.494
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

03:33:13.661 --> 03:33:16.330
Eyes always watching.

03:33:16.498 --> 03:33:20.042
Then we stabs them out.

03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:24.713
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

03:33:24.881 --> 03:33:28.342
Yes. Yes. Yes.

03:33:28.510 --> 03:33:31.220
Kill them both.

03:33:31.387 --> 03:33:33.889
Yes. No! No!

03:33:34.057 --> 03:33:37.768
It's too risky. It's too risky.

03:33:38.478 --> 03:33:41.063
Where is he? Where has he gone?

03:33:41.231 --> 03:33:43.857
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

03:33:44.025 --> 03:33:49.404
We could let her do it.

03:33:50.365 --> 03:33:54.535
Yes. She could do it.

03:33:54.702 --> 03:33:59.248
Yes, precious, she could.

03:33:59.415 --> 03:34:05.462
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

03:34:06.381 --> 03:34:08.131
Once they're dead.

03:34:08.299 --> 03:34:10.300
Shh.

03:34:13.638 --> 03:34:17.349
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

03:34:17.517 --> 03:34:19.560
Sméagol will show you the way.

03:34:19.727 --> 03:34:21.979
Follow me.
