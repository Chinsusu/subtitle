WEBVTT

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.120
Smeagol!

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.530
I've got one!

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.160
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.450
Pull it in. Go on. Go on.
Go on. Pull it in.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.510
Deagol!

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.730
Deagol?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.520
Deagol.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.420
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.670
Why?

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.010
Because...

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.940
it's my birthday and I wants it.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.230
My precious.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.710
They cursed us.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.260
Murderer.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.880
"Murderer" they called us.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.840
They cursed us and drove us away.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.680
Gollum.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.560
Gollum.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.680
Gollum.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.230
And we wept, precious.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.980
We wept to be so alone.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.360
- And cool
- So nice for feet

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.750
And we only wish To catch a fish

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.170
So juicy sweet

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.050
And we forgot the taste of bread...

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.840
the sound of trees...

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.930
the softness of the wind.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.230
We even forgot our own name.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.790
My precious.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.280
Wake up!

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.000
Wake up!

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.960
Wake up, sleepies.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.010
We must go, yes.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.850
We must go at once.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.470
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.230
I've gone and had too much.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.350
Must be getting late.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.020
No.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.100
It isn't.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.320
It isn't midday yet.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.060
The days are growing darker.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.540
Come on!

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.200
Must go! No time!

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.750
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.790
No time to lose, silly.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.840
Here.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.890
What about you?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.440
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.400
Sam.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.530
All right.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.190
We don't have that much left.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.240
We have to be careful or
we're going to run out.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.330
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.910
I've rationed it.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.080
There should be enough.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.460
For what?

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.880
The journey home.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.050
Come, Hobbitses.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.310
Very close now.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.730
Very close to Mordor.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.570
No safe places here.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.900
Hurry.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.000
It's good.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.660
Definitely from the Shire.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.010
Longbottom Leaf.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.680
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.020
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.770
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.810
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.660
Welcome, my lords...

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.080
to Isengard!

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.220
You young rascals! A merry
hunt you've led us on...

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:59.380
and now we find you feasting and...
and smoking!

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.730
We are sitting on a field of victory...

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.400
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.320
The salted pork is particularly good.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.240
Salted pork?

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.870
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.870
who's taken over management of Isengard.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.420
Young Master Gandalf.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.170
I'm glad you've come.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.750
Wood and water, stock
and stone I can master.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.590
But there is a wizard to manage here...

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.760
locked in his tower.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.770
Show yourself.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.730
Be careful.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.190
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.480
Well, let's just have his
head and be done with it.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.690
No.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.360
We need him alive.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.940
We need him to talk.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:09.040
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.700
and made peace afterwards.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.840
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.210
Can we not have peace, you and I?

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.300
We shall have peace.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.350
We shall have peace...

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.560
when you answer for the
burning of the Westfold...

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.480
and the children that lie dead there!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.400
We shall have peace when the
lives of the soldiers...

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.650
whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.360
against the gates of the
Hornburg, are avenged!

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:50.500
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.660
we shall have peace.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.130
Gibbets and crows?

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.710
Dotard!

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.010
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.510
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.600
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.770
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.890
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.440
Thousands more are now at risk.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.990
But you could save them, Saruman.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.900
So you have come here for information.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.620
I have some for you.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:41.040
Something festers in the
heart of Middle-earth.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.460
Something that you have failed to see.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.470
But the Great Eye has seen it.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.220
Even now he presses his advantage.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.310
His attack will come soon.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.650
You're all going to die.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.410
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.200
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:20.460
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.460
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.590
those he professes to love.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.180
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.390
before you sent him to his doom?

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:44.520
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.020
I've heard enough!

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.020
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.190
No.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.870
Come down, Saruman...

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.990
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.490
I have no use for it!

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.180
Saruman...

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.390
your staff is broken.

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.730
Grima, you need not follow him.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.570
You were not always as you are now.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.580
You were once a Man of Rohan.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.990
Come down.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.870
A Man of Rohan?

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.030
What is the house of Rohan...

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.870
but a thatched barn where
brigands drink in the reek...

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.750
and their brats roll on
the floor with the dogs?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.710
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.930
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.980
Grima...

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.690
come down.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.440
Be free of him.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.610
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.610
Get down, cur!

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.650
Saruman!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.120
Tell us what you know!

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.870
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.580
I will not be held prisoner here.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.250
Send word to all our allies...

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:09.330
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.000
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.140
The filth of Saruman...

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.150
is washing away.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.870
Trees will come back to live here.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.530
Young trees.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.910
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.540
Bless my bark!

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.590
Peregrin Took!

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.380
I'll take that, my lad.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.430
Quickly, now.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:04.190
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.900
Hail the victorious dead.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.480
Hail!

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.370
No pauses.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.710
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.880
So it's a drinking game?

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.130
Last one standing wins.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.470
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.060
To victory!

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.530
Be thou, Aragorn, well.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.680
I am happy for you.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.470
He is an honorable man.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.360
You are both honorable men.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.540
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.540
Don't listen to me.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.870
You are young.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.370
And tonight is for you.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.390
Here, here.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.820
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.450
I feel something.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.070
A slight tingle in my fingers.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.370
I think it's affecting me.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.000
What did I say?

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.510
He can't hold his liquor.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.180
Game over.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.770
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.890
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:58.440
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.530
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.870
But the only brew for the brave and true

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.780
Pippin!

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.290
But the only brew for the brave and true

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.330
Comes from The Green Dragon

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.890
Thank you! I win!

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.130
No news of Frodo?

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.810
No word. Nothing.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.800
We have time.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.600
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.440
Do we know that?

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.990
What does your heart tell you?

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.380
That Frodo is alive.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.340
Yes.

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.080
Yes, he's alive.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.180
Too risky. Too risky.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.600
Thieves.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:13.810
They stole it from us.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.480
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.360
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.070
Mustn't ruin it now.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.320
But they knows.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.370
They knows.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.160
They suspects us.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.910
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.670
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.710
No. Not.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.130
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:53.130
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.850
And we will.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.060
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.070
It's ours!

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.910
Ours!

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.900
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.490
Patience! Patience, my love.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.040
First we must lead them to her.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.910
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.760
Yes, the stairs. And then?

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.930
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:39.510
until we come to the tunnel.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.020
And when they go in...

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.980
there's no coming out.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.770
She's always hungry.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.740
She always needs to feed.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.320
She must eat.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.620
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.540
And they doesn't taste very
nice, does they, precious?

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.790
No.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.670
Not very nice at all, my love.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.630
She hungers for sweeter meats.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.630
Hobbit meat.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.630
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.890
then we will find it.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:26.390
And take it for me!

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.560
For us.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.070
Yes. We meant "for us."

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.690
Gollum. Gollum.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.360
The precious will be ours...

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.030
once the Hobbitses are dead!

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.000
You treacherous little toad!

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.000
No! No! Master!

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:54.800
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.350
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.680
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.760
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.520
who hates Smeagol...

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.480
and who makes up nasty lies.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.320
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.980
Sam!

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.650
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.530
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.870
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.540
You don't see it, do you?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.370
He's a villain.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.000
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.710
I need you on my side.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.840
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.300
I know, Sam. I know.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.840
Trust me.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.390
Come, Smeagol.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.800
What time is it?

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.630
Not yet dawn.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.590
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:18.770
climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.480
I stood upon the brink.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.570
It was utterly dark in the
abyss before my feet.

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:31.280
A light shone behind me...

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.320
but I could not turn.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.910
I could only stand there, waiting.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.080
Night changes many thoughts.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.620
Sleep, Eowyn.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.420
Sleep...

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.010
while you can.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.450
The stars are veiled.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.960
Something stirs in the east.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.750
A sleepless malice.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.550
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.690
What are you doing?

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.780
Pippin!

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.030
Pippin?

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.260
Pippin.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.600
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.880
Just one more time.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.220
Put it back.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.280
Pippin.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.280
No!

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.620
Pippin.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.160
He is here.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.630
I see you.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.260
Pippin!

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:19.660
Help! Gandalf, help!

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.280
Someone help him!

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.870
Pippin!

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.250
Fool of a Took!

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.560
Look at me.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.660
Gandalf, forgive me.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.700
Look at me.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.700
What did you see?

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:12.280
A tree.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.130
There was a white tree...

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.790
in a courtyard of stone.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.870
It was dead.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:26.880
The city was burning.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.140
I saw...

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.900
I saw him.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.150
I could hear his voice in my head.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.730
And what did you tell him?

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.730
Speak!

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:55.080
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.710
He hurt me.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.330
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.300
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:08.380
A fool...

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.840
but an honest fool he remains.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.840
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.270
We've been strangely fortunate.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.310
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.190
Sauron moves to strike the
city of Minas Tirith.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.530
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.030
He knows the heir of
Elendil has come forth.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.330
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.280
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.380
Sauron fears this.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.880
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.460
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.140
before he sees a king return
to the throne of Men.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:58.220
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.350
Tell me...

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.310
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.020
What do we owe Gondor?

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.200
- I will go.
- No!

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.530
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.500
You must come to Minas
Tirith by another road.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.510
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.420
Understand this:

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.260
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:38.840
I ride for Minas Tirith...

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.770
and I won't be going alone.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:49.190
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.860
Hurry! Hurry!

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.770
Where are we going?

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:56.190
Why did you look?

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.120
Why do you always have to look?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:02.370
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:04.240
I'm sorry, all right?

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.250
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.960
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.880
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.970
And you...? You're coming with me?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.590
Merry?

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:25.050
Come on.

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:31.940
How far is Minas Tirith?

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.730
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.400
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.610
Here.

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.580
Something for the road.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.410
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:49.580
I know you've run out. You
smoke too much, Pippin.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.240
But... But we'll see each other soon.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.080
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.140
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.010
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.640
Show us the meaning of haste.

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.720
Merry!

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.310
Merry!

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.290
He's always followed me...

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.000
everywhere I went...

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.130
since before we were tweens.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.210
I would get him into the
worst sort of trouble...

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.460
but I was always there to get him out.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:47.810
Now he's gone.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.390
Just like Frodo and Sam.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.770
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.600
They're a most hardy folk.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:01.850
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:18.620
Take her by the safest road.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:21.290
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:25.330
It waits to carry her across the sea.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.880
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.580
There is nothing for you here...

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.290
only death.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.870
Lady Arwen...

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.710
we cannot delay.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.430
My lady!

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.450
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.580
You have the gift of foresight.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.540
What did you see?

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:25.500
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.170
But there is also life.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:34.140
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.300
That future is almost gone.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.470
But it is not lost.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.270
Nothing is certain.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.690
Some things are certain.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.320
If I leave him now...

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.110
I will regret it forever.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.530
It is time.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.580
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.170
A light from the shadow shall spring

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.630
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.220
The crownless again shall be king

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.020
Re-forge the sword.

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.700
Father.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.600
Your hands are cold.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.100
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.440
This was my choice.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.570
Whether by your will or not...

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:33.210
there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:23.260
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.140
Minas Tirith.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:40.060
City of kings.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:13.220
Make way!

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.250
It's the tree.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.080
Gandalf. Gandalf.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.500
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.500
The tree of the king.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.350
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.180
He is a steward only, a
caretaker of the throne.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:00.470
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.800
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.730
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.360
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.070
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:54.730
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:04.950
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.290
Perhaps you come to explain this.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.470
Perhaps you come to tell
me why my son is dead.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.940
Boromir died to save us...

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.770
my kinsman and me.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:42.450
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.410
I offer you my service, such as it is...

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.950
in payment of this debt.

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.460
This is my first command to you.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.630
How did you escape and my son did not...

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.300
so mighty a man as he was?

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.310
The mightiest man may be
slain by one arrow...

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.470
and Boromir was pierced by many.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.320
Get up.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:23.110
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.320
but it is not now.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.240
War is coming.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.990
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.330
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:42.380
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:47.050
Send word to Theoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.180
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.390
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.690
Do you think the eyes of
the White Tower are blind?

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.950
I have seen more than you know.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.320
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:11.360
And with your right you'd
seek to supplant me.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.240
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:21.370
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:26.380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:31.050
last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:37.060
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:41.640
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.610
Come.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.110
All has turned to vain ambition.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:02.740
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:08.420
A thousand years this city has stood.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.920
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.350
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.060
will never bloom again.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.600
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.940
A faint and fading hope that
one day it will flower.

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:28.850
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.950
before it fell into decay.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.370
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:39.830
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.950
and counted the old names
of their descent...

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:44.910
dearer than the names of their sons.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:50.130
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.640
or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.590
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.890
The line of kings failed.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.980
The White Tree withered.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:10.850
The rule of Gondor was
given over to lesser men.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.830
Mordor.

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:27.000
Yes, there it lies.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.170
This city has dwelt ever in
the sight of its shadow.

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.830
A storm is coming.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.430
This is not the weather of the world.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.800
This is a device of Sauron's making.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.720
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.770
The Orcs of Mordor have
no love of daylight...

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.770
so he covers the face of the sun...

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.690
to ease their passage
along the road to war.

00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:57.150
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.570
it will begin.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.820
Well...

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.530
Minas Tirith...

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:07.870
very impressive.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.801
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.040
There's no leaving this city.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.590
Help must come to us.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.770
It must be getting near teatime.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:26.630
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:30.390
We're not in decent places.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.190
Mr. Frodo?

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.440
What is it?

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.280
It's just a feeling.

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.870
I don't think I'll be coming back.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.920
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.420
That's just morbid thinking.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.340
We're going there and back again...

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.800
just like Mr. Bilbo.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:08.890
You'll see.

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:20.690
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:29.120
Long ago, when there was a king.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:52.600
Mr. Frodo, look.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:56.980
The king has got a crown again.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.360
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now.
This way.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.270
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:37.680
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.770
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.310
You'll have to do as you're
told, Peregrin Took.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.860
Ridiculous Hobbit.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.240
Guard of the Citadel.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.580
Thank you.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.220
There's no more stars.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:19.930
Is it time?

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.850
Yes.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.140
It's so quiet.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:32.400
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.440
I don't want to be in a battle...

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:42.240
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.410
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.880
There never was much hope.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:53:57.590
Just a fool's hope.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.270
Our enemy is ready.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.110
His full strength's gathered.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.770
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.980
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.860
mercenaries from the coast.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.610
All will answer Mordor's call.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:23.330
Come on.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.790
This will be the end of
Gondor as we know it.

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.330
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:36.630
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.470
the last defense of this city will be gone.

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.680
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.140
Gandalf?

00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.530
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:03.820
the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.160
The one they say no living man can kill.

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:12.330
The Witch King of Angmar.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.790
You've met him before.

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:19.040
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.300
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.230
the greatest of the Nine.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.020
Minas Morgul is his lair.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:42.020
The Dead City.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.410
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:56.790
Quick. Quick.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.960
They will see. They will see.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:15.520
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.560
The way into Mordor.

00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:24.070
The secret stair.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:26.860
Climb.

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.890
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:57.600
- What's it doing?
- No.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:00.860
- They're calling me.
- No.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.470
Hide! Hide!

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.850
I can feel his blade.

00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:33.650
We come to it at last.

00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:38.360
The great battle of our time.

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:20.780
Come away, Hobbits. We climb.
We must climb.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:33.670
The board is set.

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.380
The pieces are moving.

00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.600
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.430
And then it's into the tunnel.

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.800
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.110
You listen to me, and you
listen good and proper.

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:54.190
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.940
One sniff something's not right...

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:59.280
one hair stands up on the
back of my head, it's over.

00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:02.160
No more slinker. No more stinker.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:05.110
You're gone. Got it?

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.990
I'm watching you.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.330
What was that about?

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.910
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.430
Peregrin Took, my lad, there
is a task now to be done.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.180
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:38.600
You must not fail me.

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:15.940
It's been very quiet across the river.

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:18.430
The Orcs are lying low.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:20.600
The garrison may have moved out.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.440
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

01:01:24.610 --> 01:01:27.900
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.420
Quiet.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.480
We need 10 more.

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:23.340
Kill him!

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:43.050
They're not coming from the north.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.810
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.860
Faster.

01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:09.380
Draw swords.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.510
Hold! Hold them!

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.680
What?

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:42.650
Amon Din

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.490
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:58.960
Hope is kindled.

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:35.720
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:38.560
Gondor calls for aid.

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:51.990
And Rohan will answer.

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:55.190
Muster the Rohirrim.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.260
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:16.800
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:22.260
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

01:08:23.230 --> 01:08:24.560
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:26.060
- Gamling.
- My lord.

01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:27.810
Make haste across the Riddermark.

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.110
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.850
I will.

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:39.120
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.200
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.660
The men have found their captain.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:55.170
They will follow you into
battle, even to death.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.920
You have given us hope.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:02.100
Excuse me.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.930
I have a sword.

01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:06.600
Please accept it.

01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:12.230
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:17.730
And gladly I accept it.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:22.900
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:28.990
Horse-Men.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:35.290
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.630
Your kinsmen may have
no need to ride to war.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.220
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.150
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:08.190
the doom of our time will be decided.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:16.330
Now is the hour. Riders of
Rohan, oaths you have taken.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.040
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:05.090
Faramir!

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:15.090
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.770
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:29.770
Nazgul.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.620
Take cover!

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:37.330
Nazgul!

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.160
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.630
Fall back!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.260
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:29.830
The age of Men is over.

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:35.630
The time of the Orc has come.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.340
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:44.350
Take cover, my lord!

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:45.980
It's coming!

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:54.900
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.240
Pull!

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.370
Mithrandir.

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:58.290
They broke through our defenses.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:00.680
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.930
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.640
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:16.430
Faramir?

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.200
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:24.570
No.

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.450
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:31.750
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.990
Not two days ago.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:38.920
Gandalf, they're taking the
road to the Morgul Vale.

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:42.260
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.840
What does that mean?

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:51.930
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.140
Tell me all you know.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.730
This is how you would serve your city?

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.190
You would risk its utter ruin?

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.820
I did what I judged to be right.

01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.530
What you judged to be right.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:15.040
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:23.830
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:27.010
Hidden.

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.180
Dark and deep in the vaults...

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:32.510
not to be used.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:41.570
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:44.070
I would not use the Ring.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.320
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:52.490
Ever you desire to appear
lordly and gracious...

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.910
as a king of old.

01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:00.460
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.340
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.090
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:09.776
He would have stretched out his hand to this
thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.600
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:16.090
And when he returned...

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:18.890
you would not have known your son.

01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:21.600
Boromir was loyal to me!

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:24.350
Not some wizard's pupil!

01:16:32.490 --> 01:16:33.820
Father?

01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:48.420
My son.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.030
Leave me.

01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:52.150
Careful, master. Careful.

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:55.410
Very far to fall.

01:17:57.910 --> 01:18:01.820
Very dangerous are the stairs.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.040
Come, master.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.010
Come to Smeagol.

01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:23.840
Mr. Frodo.

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.390
Get back, you!

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.770
Don't touch him!

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.740
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.610
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.160
Master?

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:46.400
Master carries heavy burden.

01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:52.000
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:55.420
Fat one cannot know.

01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:00.220
Smeagol look after master.

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:03.640
He wants it.

01:19:03.810 --> 01:19:08.350
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:13.980
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:18.020
The fat one will take it from you.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:29.570
Send forth all legions.

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:33.790
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:37.620
Slay them all.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:45.090
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:50.840
Where are Theoden's riders?

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.590
Will Rohan's army come?

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:56.010
Mithrandir.

01:19:57.070 --> 01:20:00.930
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.450
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:16.240
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:17.910
It was well-done.

01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:25.130
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

01:20:25.890 --> 01:20:28.420
You are to join the tower guard.

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:31.970
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.600
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:36.310
A very foolish one...

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.730
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.650
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.610
My father had it made for me.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:47.990
Well...

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.150
I'm taller than you were then.

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:53.660
Though I'm not likely to grow
anymore, except sideways.

01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.660
Never fitted me either.

01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:01.670
Boromir was always the soldier.

01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:07.080
They were so alike, he and my father.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.800
Proud.

01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:12.170
Stubborn even.

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:15.430
But strong.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:20.100
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

01:21:20.730 --> 01:21:23.190
And one day your father will see it.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.150
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.820
in peace or war...

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:35.910
in living or dying...

01:21:37.290 --> 01:21:38.530
from...

01:21:41.210 --> 01:21:44.000
From this hour henceforth...

01:21:44.170 --> 01:21:46.080
until my lord release me...

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:49.800
or death take me.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:52.880
And I shall not forget it...

01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:56.420
nor fail to reward that which is given.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.310
Fealty with love.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.060
Valor with honor.

01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:13.990
Disloyalty with vengeance.

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.700
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:29.630
defenses that your brother
long held intact.

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.290
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:35.250
the river in Pelennor unfought.

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.090
Osgiliath must be retaken.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:39.300
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:42.760
Much must be risked in war.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.350
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:58.820
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.620
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.780
Yes.

01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:10.670
I wish that.

01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:21.540
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:26.310
I will do what I can in his stead.

01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:38.950
If I should return, think
better of me, Father.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:44.650
That will depend on the
manner of your return.

01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.280
What are you up to?

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:11.700
Sneaking off, are we?

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.240
Sneaking?

01:25:15.250 --> 01:25:17.410
Sneaking?

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.000
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:27.250
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:29.590
and they say "sneak."

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:32.800
Sneak?

01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:36.140
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:38.930
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:42.400
You just startled me is all.

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.730
What were you doing?

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.490
Sneaking.

01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:51.950
Fine. Have it your own way.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.700
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.040
We have to be moving on.

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:05.790
It's dark still.

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:08.170
It's always dark here.

01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:14.340
It's gone!

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.430
- The Elven bread.
- What?

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.060
That's all we have left.

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:26.640
He took it. He must have!

01:26:27.150 --> 01:26:30.400
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:33.490
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:36.830
You're a lying rat! What
did you do with it?!

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.540
He doesn't eat it.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.870
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.750
What's this?

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.760
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:53.130
He took it.

01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:58.180
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:00.140
That's a filthy lie!

01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:02.520
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:03.930
- Sam!
- Call me...

01:27:04.110 --> 01:27:05.350
Stop it!

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.560
Sam!

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:12.480
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:19.070
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.370
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.610
- I'm all right.
- No.

01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:26.880
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.170
It's that Gollum.

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:31.050
It's this place.

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:33.790
It's that thing around your neck.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.580
I could help a bit.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.430
I could carry it for a while.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.340
Carry it for a while.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.000
I could carry it... I could carry it.

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:50.850
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:52.220
Get away!

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.980
I don't want to keep it.

01:27:57.570 --> 01:27:59.570
I just want to help.

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.240
See? See?

01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:07.830
He wants it for himself.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.710
Shut up, you!

01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:12.080
Go away! Get out of here!

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:14.080
No, Sam.

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:15.500
It's you.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.430
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.470
But he's a liar.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:27.310
He's poisoned you against me.

01:28:28.730 --> 01:28:30.640
You can't help me anymore.

01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:34.480
You don't mean that.

01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:38.780
Go home.

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.610
Faramir!

01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.690
Faramir!

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.240
Your father's will has turned to madness.

01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.450
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.530
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.080
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:19.500
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:22.870
her memory, her wisdom.

01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:28.670
Your father loves you, Faramir.

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:32.390
He will remember it before the end.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.540
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:48.020
Well...

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:50.190
yes.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:54.650
At least, well enough for my own people.

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.690
But we have no songs for great halls...

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:00.990
and evil times.

01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:05.000
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.210
Come, sing me a song.

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:23.600
Home is behind

01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:27.520
The world ahead

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:35.780
And there are many paths to tread

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:41.110
Through shadow

01:32:41.290 --> 01:32:45.450
To the edge of night

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.200
Until the stars are all alight

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:59.540
Mist and shadow

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:04.010
Cloud and shade

01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:09.730
All shall fade

01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:16.100
All shall

01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:24.240
Fade

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.090
March! March!

01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:57.480
March! March! March!

01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:03.270
Make way for the king.

01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:06.780
Make way.

01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:11.290
The king is here.

01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.870
My lord.

01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:18.080
Hail to you, sire.

01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:19.740
Grimbold, how many?

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.380
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:26.010
We have 300 more from
Fenmarch, Theoden King.

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:31.090
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.280
Six thousand spears.

01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:53.320
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:56.990
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.500
More will come.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.830
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

01:35:05.010 --> 01:35:07.580
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:29.400
The horses are restless...

01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:31.070
and the men are quiet.

01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:34.650
They grow nervous in the
shadow of the mountain.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.000
That road there...

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.990
where does that lead?

01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:46.590
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.300
None who venture there ever return.

01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:53.390
That mountain is evil.

01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:18.150
Aragorn.

01:36:18.910 --> 01:36:20.820
Let's find some food.

01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:38.720
There.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.680
A true esquire of Rohan.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.310
I'm ready.

01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.180
Sorry.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.600
It isn't all that dangerous.

01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:56.440
It's not even sharp.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.530
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.200
Come on.

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.870
To the smithy. Go!

01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:12.880
You should not encourage him.

01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:15.500
You should not doubt him.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.960
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.260
Why should Merry be left behind?

01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:26.060
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:31.400
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:37.650
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:40.980
When the fear takes him...

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:46.200
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:48.740
do you think he would stand and fight?

01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:52.920
He would flee.

01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:55.130
And he would be right to do so.

01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:01.290
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.660
I choose a mortal life.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.470
I wish I could've seen him...

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.300
one last time.

01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:02.900
Sir?

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.310
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:30.050
I take my leave.

01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:45.940
My lord Elrond.

01:39:46.530 --> 01:39:50.030
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.110
Arwen is dying.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.960
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.080
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:12.260
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

01:40:12.430 --> 01:40:16.180
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:19.510
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:21.560
The end has come.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.560
It will not be our end, but his.

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.900
You ride to war, but not to victory.

01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:33.570
Sauron's armies march on
Minas Tirith, this you know.

01:40:33.740 --> 01:40:38.160
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:42.040
A fleet of Corsair ships
sails from the south.

01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:44.750
They'll be in the city in two days.

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:48.090
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:50.920
You need more men.

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.050
There are none.

01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:58.720
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:09.890
Murderers...

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:11.480
traitors.

01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.110
You would call upon them to fight?

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.860
They believe in nothing.

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.160
They answer to no one.

01:41:20.330 --> 01:41:23.410
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:35.670
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:54.400
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:13.210
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:15.790
The man who can wield the
power of this sword...

01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:19.830
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.840
Put aside the Ranger.

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:27.350
Become who you were born to be.

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:29.510
Take the Dimholt road.

01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:36.310
I give hope to Men.

01:42:39.570 --> 01:42:43.700
I keep none for myself.

01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:57.210
Why are you doing this?

01:42:57.670 --> 01:43:00.880
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:05.380
You cannot abandon the men.

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.260
Eowyn...

01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:10.640
We need you here.

01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:13.650
Why have you come?

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.270
Do you not know?

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.580
It is but a shadow and a
thought that you love.

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.910
I cannot give you what you seek.

01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:53.350
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.790
Just where do you think you're off to?

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.290
Not this time.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.670
This time you must stay, Gimli.

01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:24.220
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:28.050
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

01:44:50.370 --> 01:44:52.530
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:54.740
Where's he going?

01:44:57.330 --> 01:44:59.370
I don't understand.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.590
Lord Aragorn!

01:45:06.010 --> 01:45:08.710
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:12.000
He leaves because there is no hope.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.800
He leaves because he must.

01:45:14.970 --> 01:45:16.680
Too few have come.

01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:19.010
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:23.180
No...

01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:24.850
we cannot.

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:31.520
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.710
I have left instruction.

01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:53.630
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:02.470
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

01:46:03.730 --> 01:46:06.570
Long may you defend Edoras...

01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:09.060
if the battle goes ill.

01:46:10.150 --> 01:46:13.570
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.740
Duty?

01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:21.240
No.

01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:31.670
I would have you smile again...

01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:40.090
not grieve for those whose time has come.

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:48.440
You shall live to see these days renewed...

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:55.530
and no more despair.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:05.440
What kind of army would
linger in such a place?

01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.450
One that is cursed.

01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:11.960
Long ago, the Men of the
Mountains swore an oath...

01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:15.130
to the last king of Gondor...

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.290
to come to his aid...

01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:19.180
to fight.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.840
But when the time came...

01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:25.090
when Gondor's need was dire...

01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:27.140
they fled...

01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:30.680
vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain.

01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:34.060
And so Isildur cursed them...

01:47:35.610 --> 01:47:39.480
never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:46.950
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

01:47:47.410 --> 01:47:49.660
The forgotten people.

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:52.320
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:54.670
From the north shall he come.

01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:56.830
Need shall drive him.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:01.420
He shall pass the door to
the Paths of the Dead.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:23.190
The very warmth of my
blood seems stolen away.

01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:30.700
The way is shut.

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:33.410
It was made by those who are dead.

01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.280
And the Dead keep it.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.380
The way is shut.

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:51.220
Brego!

01:48:54.730 --> 01:48:57.430
I do not fear death.

01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:12.150
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:16.990
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

01:49:17.170 --> 01:49:18.500
Oh.

01:49:18.670 --> 01:49:21.500
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.760
We must ride light and swift.

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.680
It is a long road ahead.

01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:43.940
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:52.450
Little Hobbits do not belong
in war, Master Meriadoc.

01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.780
All my friends have gone to battle.

01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:56.830
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.120
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:01.660
And none of my riders can
bear you as a burden.

01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:04.790
I want to fight.

01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:07.290
I will say no more.

01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:26.060
Ride with me.

01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:28.940
My lady.

01:50:29.110 --> 01:50:31.480
Form up! Move out!

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.860
Form up! Move out!

01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:39.150
Ride!

01:50:39.330 --> 01:50:42.280
Ride now to Gondor!

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.660
What is it?

01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:27.380
What do you see?

01:51:27.630 --> 01:51:29.750
I see shapes of men.

01:51:32.420 --> 01:51:33.800
And of horses.

01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:35.750
Where?

01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:38.880
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:43.510
Spears rise...

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.590
like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

01:51:48.860 --> 01:51:51.010
The Dead are following.

01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:53.730
They have been summoned.

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:56.230
The Dead?

01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:58.320
Summoned?

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:00.610
I knew that.

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:05.700
Very good.

01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:08.490
Very good! Legolas!

01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:47.860
Do not look down.

01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:45.590
Who enters my domain?

01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:51.550
One who will have your allegiance.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:59.860
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

01:54:00.190 --> 01:54:02.860
You will suffer me.

01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:29.750
The way is shut.

01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:35.390
It was made by those who are dead.

01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:39.930
And the Dead keep it.

01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:52.160
The way is shut.

01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:56.530
Now you must die.

01:55:00.420 --> 01:55:03.250
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:08.540
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:16.300
That line was broken.

01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:21.140
It has been remade.

01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:30.610
Fight for us...

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.320
and regain your honor.

01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:38.820
What say you?

01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:52.590
What say you?

01:55:53.340 --> 01:55:55.130
You waste your time, Aragorn.

01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:58.470
They had no honor in life,
they have none now in death.

01:55:58.970 --> 01:56:01.460
I am Isildur's heir.

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:03.970
Fight for me...

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.140
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:14.030
What say you?

01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:24.160
You have my word!

01:56:24.460 --> 01:56:28.450
Fight, and I will release
you from this living death!

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:31.410
What say you?!

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:37.670
Stand, you traitors!

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:05.650
Out!

01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:28.590
Legolas!

01:57:29.730 --> 01:57:30.930
Run!

01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:39.330
We fight.

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:52.250
Open the gate! Quick!

01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.290
Quick! Hurry!

01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.690
Faramir!

01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:44.940
Say not that he has fallen.

01:59:46.110 --> 01:59:47.650
They were outnumbered.

01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:49.650
None survived.

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.360
Fear.

01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:56.110
The city is rank with it.

01:59:58.460 --> 02:00:00.910
Let us ease their pain.

02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:02.910
Release the prisoners.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:05.040
Catapults!

02:00:18.390 --> 02:00:21.840
My sons are spent.

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.810
My line has ended.

02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:30.060
He's alive!

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.400
The House of Stewards has failed.

02:00:33.570 --> 02:00:35.030
He needs medicine, my lord.

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.740
My line has ended!

02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:42.240
My lord!

02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.590
Rohan...

02:00:58.350 --> 02:01:00.750
has deserted us.

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:18.400
Theoden's betrayed me.

02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:31.370
Abandon your posts!

02:01:32.420 --> 02:01:36.340
Flee! Flee for your lives!

02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:48.020
Prepare for battle!

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:51.730
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:54.860
Over here!

02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:57.980
Return to your posts!

02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:11.410
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:23.050
Stay where you are.

02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:41.440
We need more rubble!

02:02:41.610 --> 02:02:43.490
Watch out!

02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.190
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:49.620
Double up, men!

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.610
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:05.610
Stand to your posts! Fight!

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.900
Not at the towers!

02:04:48.070 --> 02:04:51.070
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:53.650
Bring them down!

02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:30.810
Fight them back!

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.980
Peregrin Took!

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:37.030
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:55.090
This is no place for a Hobbit.

02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:22.280
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:26.240
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:40.550
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.680
The door won't give. It's too strong.

02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:51.430
Get back there and smash it down.

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:53.600
But nothing can breach it.

02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:58.770
Grond will breach it.

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:04.270
Bring up the wolf's head.

02:07:07.450 --> 02:07:12.790
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:13.130 --> 02:07:16.960
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:22.300
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:26.680
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:31.260
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:35.140
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.170
You may go no further.

02:07:54.610 --> 02:07:57.110
You will not enter Gondor.

02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:00.160
Who are you to deny us passage?

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:04.200
Legolas, fire a warning
shot past the bosun's ear.

02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:07.540
Mind your aim.

02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:16.820
That's it. Right. We warned you.

02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:19.010
Prepare to be boarded.

02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:21.920
Boarded?

02:08:21.930 --> 02:08:23.910
By you and whose army?

02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:27.140
This army.

02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:45.800
In there.

02:08:47.890 --> 02:08:49.610
What is this place?

02:08:54.150 --> 02:08:57.430
Master must go inside the tunnel.

02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:02.590
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:06.970
It's the only way.

02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:11.350
Go in...

02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:14.040
or go back.

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:19.500
I can't go back.

02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:34.850
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.810
Orcses come in here sometimes.

02:09:43.410 --> 02:09:44.660
Hurry.

02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:51.490
This way.

02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:56.130
Smeagol?

02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:59.260
Over here.

02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:10.730
It's sticky. What is it?

02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:13.230
You will see.

02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:15.680
Oh, yes.

02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:19.020
You will see.

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:29.860
Smeagol?

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:32.660
Smeagol!

02:10:35.290 --> 02:10:36.960
Smeagol!

02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:48.000
Sam.

02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:30.790
And you, Frodo Baggins...

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:35.730
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

02:12:36.970 --> 02:12:40.190
May it be a light for you in dark places...

02:12:40.230 --> 02:12:43.820
when all other lights go out.

02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:47.710
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:03.150
Naughty little fly.

02:14:03.770 --> 02:14:07.110
Why does he cry?

02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:10.710
Caught in a web

02:14:11.120 --> 02:14:13.330
Soon you'll be...

02:14:13.710 --> 02:14:15.540
Eaten.

02:14:53.660 --> 02:14:55.580
Got away, did it, precious?

02:14:56.010 --> 02:14:57.780
Not this time.

02:14:57.990 --> 02:15:00.960
- Not this time!
- No!

02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:11.140
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

02:15:13.070 --> 02:15:14.620
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.300
We promised.

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:19.210
You must believe us.

02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:20.860
It was the precious.

02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:25.820
The precious made us do it.

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:45.840
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

02:15:55.290 --> 02:15:58.180
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

02:16:08.630 --> 02:16:09.690
No!

02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:35.340
I'm so sorry, Sam.

02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:42.380
I'm so sorry.

02:17:08.690 --> 02:17:12.960
This task was appointed to
you, Frodo of the Shire.

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:16.620
If you do not find a way...

02:17:18.130 --> 02:17:19.740
no one will.

02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:55.590
The scouts report Minas
Tirith is surrounded.

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:58.050
The lower level's in flames.

02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:00.970
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:02.960
Time is against us.

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:04.260
Make ready!

02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:06.260
Take heart, Merry.

02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:08.650
It will soon be over.

02:18:09.710 --> 02:18:10.940
My lady...

02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:14.070
you are fair and brave...

02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:16.830
and have much to live for...

02:18:18.450 --> 02:18:20.480
and many who love you.

02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:26.000
I know it is too late to turn aside.

02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:29.740
I know there is not much
point now in hoping.

02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:34.709
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

02:18:34.710 --> 02:18:37.670
But
- I'm not.

02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:39.680
I'm a Hobbit.

02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:44.890
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

02:18:48.690 --> 02:18:50.590
I just want to help my friends.

02:18:53.010 --> 02:18:54.180
Frodo.

02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.770
Sam.

02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:00.400
Pippin.

02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:05.420
More than anything, I wish
I could see them again.

02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:11.450
Prepare to move out!

02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:15.070
Make haste. We ride through the night.

02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:32.490
To battle.

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.460
To battle.

02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:59.130
Back to the gate!

02:19:59.850 --> 02:20:01.580
Hurry!

02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:25.980
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:28.630
Thus have I walked.

02:20:30.090 --> 02:20:33.010
And thus now will I sleep.

02:20:39.210 --> 02:20:41.000
Gondor is lost.

02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:44.910
There is no hope for Men.

02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:02.360
Why do the fools fly?

02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:06.990
Better to die sooner than late.

02:21:09.450 --> 02:21:11.190
For die we must.

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:27.170
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:33.530
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:38.840
We shall burn, like the
heathen kings of old.

02:21:42.970 --> 02:21:44.350
Bring wood and oil.

02:21:47.610 --> 02:21:48.610
Steady.

02:21:49.230 --> 02:21:50.730
Steady.

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:07.890
You are soldiers of Gondor.

02:22:08.410 --> 02:22:12.740
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

02:22:19.020 --> 02:22:20.020
Run!

02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:23.740
Volley!

02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:26.060
Fire!

02:24:19.740 --> 02:24:21.460
Let him go, you filth.

02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:24.900
Let him go!

02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:28.600
You will not touch him again.

02:24:31.890 --> 02:24:33.350
Come on and finish it.

02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:24.630
Back!

02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:37.010
Mr. Frodo.

02:26:46.810 --> 02:26:48.270
Oh, no.

02:26:48.890 --> 02:26:50.400
Frodo.

02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:52.570
Mr. Frodo.

02:26:57.520 --> 02:26:58.640
Wake up.

02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:04.900
Don't leave me here alone.

02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:08.860
Don't go where I can't follow.

02:27:13.290 --> 02:27:14.440
Wake up.

02:27:21.370 --> 02:27:23.300
Not asleep.

02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:27.370
Dead.

02:27:46.290 --> 02:27:48.170
You get back, you scum!

02:27:57.610 --> 02:27:59.170
What's this?

02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:02.920
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:07.100
Killed another one, has she?

02:28:07.410 --> 02:28:09.230
No.

02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:14.250
This fellow ain't dead.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.430
Not dead?

02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:22.370
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

02:28:23.050 --> 02:28:25.660
Then she has her way with them.

02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:28.260
That's how she likes to feed.

02:28:28.420 --> 02:28:30.350
Fresh blood.

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:32.750
Get him to the tower!

02:28:36.450 --> 02:28:38.200
Samwise, you fool.

02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:41.090
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.640
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

02:29:08.140 --> 02:29:11.170
The house of his spirit crumbles.

02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:13.780
He is burning.

02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:16.430
Already burning.

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:18.360
He's not dead.

02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:20.710
He's not dead!

02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:24.470
No! No!

02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:26.970
No! No!

02:29:27.430 --> 02:29:29.420
He's not dead!

02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:33.220
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

02:29:33.430 --> 02:29:36.560
I release you from my service.

02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:42.240
Go now and die in what
way seems best to you.

02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:46.650
Pour oil on the wood!

02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:50.410
Come on, soldier! Move it!

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:53.830
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

02:29:54.490 --> 02:29:55.200
Where is Gandalf?

02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:55.740
Gandalf!
Where is Gandalf?

02:29:55.741 --> 02:29:58.250
Gandalf!

02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:05.080
Retreat!

02:30:07.270 --> 02:30:08.990
The city is breached!

02:30:09.140 --> 02:30:12.060
Fall back! To the second level!

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:17.690
Get the women and children out!

02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:19.460
Get them out!

02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:21.080
Retreat!

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:23.170
Come on. Come on, move.

02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:27.700
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:38.020
Take them down!

02:30:58.830 --> 02:31:01.640
Fight! Fight to the last man!

02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:03.310
Fight for your lives!

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:04.720
Gandalf!

02:31:08.910 --> 02:31:10.090
Gandalf!

02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:12.850
Denethor has lost his mind!

02:31:13.060 --> 02:31:15.250
He's burning Faramir alive!

02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:17.230
Up! Quickly!

02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:25.520
Go back to the abyss.

02:31:27.340 --> 02:31:30.680
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

02:31:31.030 --> 02:31:37.350
Do you not know death
when you see it, old man?

02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:41.600
This is my hour.

02:31:51.850 --> 02:31:52.850
Gandalf!

02:32:02.090 --> 02:32:05.300
You have failed.

02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:11.240
The world of Men will fall.

02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:09.530
Courage, Merry.

02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:12.190
Courage for our friends.

02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:19.140
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

02:33:19.170 --> 02:33:22.350
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:33.770
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

02:33:34.010 --> 02:33:35.070
Flank ready.

02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:37.990
Gamling, follow the king's
banner down the center.

02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:41.950
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

02:33:42.270 --> 02:33:44.670
Forth, and fear no darkness!

02:33:45.080 --> 02:33:48.730
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:54.260
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

02:33:54.570 --> 02:33:58.060
a sword-day, a red day...

02:33:58.390 --> 02:34:01.740
and the sun rises!

02:34:09.790 --> 02:34:14.280
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:22.510
Ride now!

02:34:24.030 --> 02:34:25.890
Ride now!

02:34:26.740 --> 02:34:29.550
Ride! Ride for ruin...

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:32.940
and the world's ending!

02:34:34.350 --> 02:34:38.260
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:39.350 --> 02:34:42.430
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.040
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:45.450 --> 02:34:49.730
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:53.850 --> 02:34:56.350
For Eorlingas!

02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:40.770
Fire!

02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:46.820
Death!

02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:52.080
Charge!

02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:53.220
Fire at will!

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.070
Set a fire in our flesh.

02:37:11.970 --> 02:37:13.620
Stay this madness!

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.380
You may triumph in the field
of battle for a day...

02:37:23.010 --> 02:37:26.550
but against the power that
has risen in the east...

02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:29.780
there is no victory.

02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:01.010
No!

02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:03.930
You will not take my son from me!

02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.070
No!

02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:18.680
Faramir.

02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:36.200
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:06.230
Drive them to the river!

02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:10.870
Make safe the city!

02:39:50.650 --> 02:39:52.370
Re-form the line!

02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:55.440
Re-form the line!

02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:05.400
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:08.060
Charge!

02:41:26.890 --> 02:41:28.140
Cut him down!

02:41:55.140 --> 02:41:57.590
Take the reins. Pull him left!

02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:01.090
Left!

02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:20.330
Aim for their heads!

02:42:26.370 --> 02:42:29.710
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

02:42:35.390 --> 02:42:36.390
Merry!

02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:44.980
Merry!

02:43:58.440 --> 02:44:00.370
I didn't think it would end this way.

02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:03.190
End?

02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:06.780
No, the journey doesn't end here.

02:44:09.070 --> 02:44:12.000
Death is just another path...

02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:14.860
one that we all must take.

02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:19.400
The grey rain curtain of
this world rolls back...

02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.940
and all turns to silver glass.

02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:27.010
And then you see it.

02:44:28.930 --> 02:44:32.440
What, Gandalf?

02:44:32.610 --> 02:44:34.050
See what?

02:44:35.170 --> 02:44:37.180
White shores...

02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:41.300
and beyond.

02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:44.740
A far green country...

02:44:45.500 --> 02:44:48.230
under a swift sunrise.

02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:54.120
Well...

02:44:54.170 --> 02:44:55.740
that isn't so bad.

02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.040
No.

02:44:59.390 --> 02:45:01.000
No, it isn't.

02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:20.710
Rally to me! To me!

02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:46.050
Feast on his flesh.

02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:52.620
I will kill you if you touch him.

02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:58.140
Do not come between the
Nazgul and his prey.

02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:10.500
Late as usual, pirate scum!

02:47:10.740 --> 02:47:12.540
There's knife-work here needs doing.

02:47:12.590 --> 02:47:16.410
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

02:47:31.540 --> 02:47:33.920
There's plenty for the both of us.

02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:36.360
May the best Dwarf win.

02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:55.950
You fool.

02:47:56.120 --> 02:47:59.540
No man can kill me.

02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:05.090
Die now.

02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:17.760
I am no man.

02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:37.780
- 15! 16!
- 17!

02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:47.500
Merry!

02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:31.300
Legolas!

02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:56.070
33, 34.

02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:45.530
That still only counts as one!

02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.040
Come on, then. Come on!

02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:34.420
I know your face...

02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:38.120
Eowyn.

02:51:40.720 --> 02:51:43.090
My eyes darken.

02:51:44.180 --> 02:51:45.620
No.

02:51:46.430 --> 02:51:48.120
No.

02:51:50.130 --> 02:51:52.630
I am going to save you.

02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:56.300
You already did.

02:51:59.990 --> 02:52:01.610
Eowyn...

02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:05.600
my body is broken.

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:13.120
You have to let me go.

02:52:18.980 --> 02:52:21.580
I go to my fathers...

02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:25.880
in whose mighty company...

02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:29.680
I shall not now feel ashamed.

02:52:46.250 --> 02:52:47.900
Eowyn.

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:36.870
Release us.

02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:40.500
Bad idea.

02:53:40.650 --> 02:53:44.380
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:46.660
You gave us your word.

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:50.530
I hold your oath fulfilled.

02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:53.210
Go.

02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:55.760
Be at peace.

02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:41.000
Merry.

02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:44.910
No!

02:54:48.450 --> 02:54:51.210
No!

02:55:14.860 --> 02:55:18.790
With a sigh.

02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:22.670
You turn away.

02:55:22.810 --> 02:55:26.840
With a deepening heart.

02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:31.780
No more words to say.

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:35.420
You will find.

02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:43.480
That the world has changed forever.

02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:16.480
And the trees are now
turning from green to gold.

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:25.160
And the sun is now fading.

02:56:25.270 --> 02:56:33.270
I wish I could hold you closer.

02:56:38.170 --> 02:56:39.450
Merry!

02:56:40.990 --> 02:56:43.100
Merry!

02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:56.270
Merry.

02:56:58.740 --> 02:56:59.980
Merry, it's me.

02:57:02.590 --> 02:57:04.160
It's Pippin.

02:57:06.660 --> 02:57:08.950
I knew you'd find me.

02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:10.320
Yes.

02:57:12.750 --> 02:57:14.830
Are you going to leave me?

02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:17.080
No, Merry.

02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:20.620
I'm going to look after you.

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:06.040
Hands off!

02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:09.380
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

02:58:09.640 --> 02:58:13.800
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:19.230
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

02:58:20.010 --> 02:58:25.170
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

02:58:45.660 --> 02:58:47.590
The scum tried to knife me.

02:58:47.640 --> 02:58:49.590
Kill him!

03:00:32.750 --> 03:00:34.810
That's for Frodo!

03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:37.320
And for the Shire!

03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:43.030
And that's for my old Gaffer!

03:01:12.470 --> 03:01:15.860
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:21.700
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:30.700
Not if I stick you first.

03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:32.390
Sam!

03:01:37.450 --> 03:01:39.530
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:41.720
Sorry for everything.

03:01:41.930 --> 03:01:45.890
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.930
They've taken it. Sam...

03:01:49.700 --> 03:01:51.220
they took the Ring.

03:01:51.940 --> 03:01:54.680
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:08.870
I thought I'd lost you.

03:02:09.250 --> 03:02:10.950
So I took it.

03:02:12.110 --> 03:02:14.200
Only for safekeeping.

03:02:15.450 --> 03:02:17.200
Give it to me.

03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:22.960
Give me the Ring, Sam.

03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:28.880
Sam.

03:02:30.470 --> 03:02:32.430
Give me the Ring.

03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:54.450
You must understand.

03:02:57.940 --> 03:02:59.790
The Ring is my burden.

03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:03.120
It will destroy you, Sam.

03:03:06.280 --> 03:03:08.260
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

03:03:09.570 --> 03:03:11.220
We best find you some clothes.

03:03:11.390 --> 03:03:14.430
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

03:03:36.170 --> 03:03:38.370
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

03:03:38.880 --> 03:03:41.160
We made it to Mordor.

03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:44.160
There are so many of them.

03:03:45.130 --> 03:03:47.710
We'll never get through unseen.

03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:56.180
It's him, the Eye.

03:04:03.900 --> 03:04:06.520
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

03:04:06.990 --> 03:04:09.030
There's nothing for it.

03:04:12.030 --> 03:04:16.450
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

03:04:25.630 --> 03:04:29.050
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:33.190
The darkness is deepening.

03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:35.540
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

03:04:35.550 --> 03:04:37.970
It's only a matter of time.

03:04:39.450 --> 03:04:41.880
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

03:04:42.940 --> 03:04:47.420
behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:49.350
Let him stay there.

03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:52.240
Let him rot! Why should we care?

03:04:52.300 --> 03:04:57.640
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

03:05:04.310 --> 03:05:06.870
I've sent him to his death.

03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:09.700
No.

03:05:10.210 --> 03:05:12.620
There is still hope for Frodo.

03:05:12.970 --> 03:05:17.100
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

03:05:18.180 --> 03:05:20.750
- We can give him that.
- How?

03:05:21.100 --> 03:05:23.810
Draw out Sauron's armies.

03:05:23.970 --> 03:05:26.100
Empty his lands.

03:05:26.310 --> 03:05:29.400
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

03:05:29.960 --> 03:05:33.030
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:34.770
Not for ourselves.

03:05:34.970 --> 03:05:40.580
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

03:05:42.370 --> 03:05:46.160
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:48.120
A diversion.

03:05:48.260 --> 03:05:50.090
Certainty of death...

03:05:50.190 --> 03:05:53.010
small chance of success...

03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:55.460
what are we waiting for?

03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:58.460
Sauron will suspect a trap.

03:05:59.260 --> 03:06:01.300
He will not take the bait.

03:06:02.810 --> 03:06:05.300
Oh, I think he will.

03:06:39.620 --> 03:06:42.330
Long have you hunted me.

03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:44.520
Long have I eluded you.

03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:47.930
No more.

03:06:49.570 --> 03:06:52.050
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:39.060
The city has fallen silent.

03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:43.770
There is no warmth left in the sun.

03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:46.280
It grows so cold.

03:07:49.270 --> 03:07:52.320
It's just the damp of
the first spring rain.

03:07:58.700 --> 03:08:01.920
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:32.120
Look, the Orcs...

03:08:32.590 --> 03:08:34.660
they're moving off.

03:08:35.710 --> 03:08:37.780
You see, Mr. Frodo...

03:08:37.960 --> 03:08:40.290
some luck at last.

03:08:40.460 --> 03:08:42.290
Move it, you slugs!

03:08:43.540 --> 03:08:46.960
Come on! Faster!

03:08:54.850 --> 03:08:58.080
Come along, you coldhearted
wretched scum...

03:08:58.090 --> 03:09:02.640
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

03:09:05.490 --> 03:09:07.160
Come on!

03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:09.530
What have I told you?

03:09:09.550 --> 03:09:11.850
No evation...

03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:14.660
Now move it!

03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:17.990
Get up!

03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:21.040
Come on, you slugs!

03:09:21.180 --> 03:09:24.830
You two are going straight
to the front line!

03:09:25.010 --> 03:09:30.300
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:46.670
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

03:09:56.110 --> 03:09:59.700
Don't you know we're at war?

03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:24.890
Company, halt!

03:10:28.690 --> 03:10:32.100
Inspection!

03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:34.740
Sam, help me.

03:10:34.900 --> 03:10:36.730
Mr. Frodo!

03:10:39.430 --> 03:10:41.990
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:43.990
It's so heavy.

03:10:53.090 --> 03:10:54.300
Oh, no.

03:10:59.920 --> 03:11:01.920
What do I do? What do we do?

03:11:04.980 --> 03:11:06.140
- Hit me.
- What?

03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:08.350
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

03:11:08.520 --> 03:11:10.100
Get off of me!

03:11:10.770 --> 03:11:13.100
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:23.780
Get off of me!

03:11:24.690 --> 03:11:26.620
Break it up! Break it up!

03:11:29.170 --> 03:11:33.790
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

03:11:33.810 --> 03:11:36.250
Go, Sam. Now!

03:11:45.170 --> 03:11:46.730
Move along, scum!

03:11:46.890 --> 03:11:48.800
Back in the line!

03:11:49.290 --> 03:11:51.110
You maggots!

03:11:51.740 --> 03:11:54.780
Get back into the line, you slugs!

03:11:57.110 --> 03:12:00.650
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

03:12:49.350 --> 03:12:51.500
I can't...

03:12:51.650 --> 03:12:55.410
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:56.740
It's... It's...

03:12:56.910 --> 03:12:59.490
It's such a weight to carry.

03:13:00.350 --> 03:13:01.410
It's...

03:13:01.550 --> 03:13:03.550
Such a weight.

03:13:08.480 --> 03:13:10.990
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:15.580
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:32.570
Mr. Frodo.

03:13:34.030 --> 03:13:35.580
Look.

03:13:38.050 --> 03:13:40.000
There is light...

03:13:40.340 --> 03:13:41.900
and beauty up there...

03:13:42.160 --> 03:13:44.630
that no shadow can touch.

03:14:35.650 --> 03:14:37.310
Take mine.

03:14:37.790 --> 03:14:39.930
There's a few drops left.

03:14:55.100 --> 03:14:57.740
There will be none left
for the return journey.

03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:01.830
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

03:15:54.690 --> 03:15:56.880
Frodo, get down!

03:15:58.600 --> 03:16:00.550
Hide!

03:16:10.690 --> 03:16:12.730
Frodo!

03:16:18.510 --> 03:16:19.990
Where are they?

03:16:56.050 --> 03:16:59.110
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

03:17:00.010 --> 03:17:02.870
Let justice be done upon him!

03:17:46.310 --> 03:17:50.320
My master, Sauron the
Great, bids thee welcome.

03:17:56.160 --> 03:17:59.870
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:03.380
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

03:18:03.510 --> 03:18:06.070
faithless and accursed.

03:18:06.080 --> 03:18:10.080
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

03:18:10.190 --> 03:18:13.000
He is to depart these
lands, never to return.

03:18:13.940 --> 03:18:16.520
Old Greybeard.

03:18:17.850 --> 03:18:22.240
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

03:18:27.240 --> 03:18:28.570
Frodo.

03:18:31.410 --> 03:18:32.870
Frodo.

03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:35.070
- Silence.
- No!

03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:37.250
Silence!

03:18:39.020 --> 03:18:42.800
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

03:18:43.710 --> 03:18:47.880
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

03:18:53.250 --> 03:18:59.150
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

03:19:00.750 --> 03:19:03.900
And he did, Gandalf.

03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:05.820
He did.

03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:14.320
And who is this?

03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:16.570
Isildur's heir?

03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:19.750
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

03:19:24.480 --> 03:19:27.080
I guess that concludes negotiations.

03:19:29.220 --> 03:19:30.420
I do not believe it.

03:19:32.400 --> 03:19:33.810
I will not.

03:19:49.870 --> 03:19:51.700
Pull back.

03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:54.030
Pull back!

03:20:06.240 --> 03:20:08.300
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:13.740
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

03:20:13.850 --> 03:20:15.760
Something's drawn its gaze.

03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:36.040
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

03:20:37.880 --> 03:20:42.120
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:46.880
I see in your eyes...

03:20:47.210 --> 03:20:51.300
the same fear that would
take the heart of me.

03:20:53.260 --> 03:20:57.020
A day may come when the
courage of Men fails...

03:20:57.040 --> 03:21:00.630
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

03:21:00.660 --> 03:21:03.480
But it is not this day.

03:21:03.740 --> 03:21:06.810
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

03:21:06.970 --> 03:21:09.850
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.480
But it is not this day.

03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:14.320
This day we fight!

03:21:16.410 --> 03:21:20.450
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

03:21:20.620 --> 03:21:24.870
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

03:22:53.330 --> 03:22:56.870
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

03:22:57.340 --> 03:22:59.670
What about side by side with a friend?

03:23:03.180 --> 03:23:04.970
Aye.

03:23:05.790 --> 03:23:07.600
I could do that.

03:23:37.900 --> 03:23:40.000
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:45.210
It'll be spring soon.

03:23:45.980 --> 03:23:48.720
And the orchards will be in blossom.

03:23:48.850 --> 03:23:52.560
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

03:23:53.910 --> 03:23:57.940
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:03.360
and eating the first of the
strawberries with cream.

03:24:05.270 --> 03:24:07.770
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

03:24:09.340 --> 03:24:11.080
No, Sam.

03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:14.200
I can't recall the taste of food...

03:24:15.330 --> 03:24:18.620
nor the sound of water...

03:24:18.780 --> 03:24:22.380
nor the touch of grass.

03:24:23.310 --> 03:24:24.880
I'm...

03:24:25.760 --> 03:24:27.140
naked in the dark.

03:24:28.780 --> 03:24:31.090
There's... there's nothing.

03:24:31.240 --> 03:24:35.980
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

03:24:37.230 --> 03:24:39.140
I can see him...

03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:41.230
with my waking eyes.

03:24:42.240 --> 03:24:44.730
Then let us be rid of it...

03:24:45.310 --> 03:24:47.560
once and for all.

03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:50.360
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

03:24:50.520 --> 03:24:53.160
I can't carry it for you...

03:24:53.550 --> 03:24:55.620
but I can carry you.

03:24:56.160 --> 03:24:57.910
Come on!

03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:31.280
Aragorn.

03:25:42.820 --> 03:25:46.570
Elessar.

03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:59.840
For Frodo.

03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:36.300
Look, Mr. Frodo.

03:26:36.980 --> 03:26:39.220
A doorway.

03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:41.470
We're almost there.

03:26:43.810 --> 03:26:47.760
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

03:27:01.690 --> 03:27:03.370
Mustn't go that way.

03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:07.370
Mustn't hurt the precious.

03:27:07.530 --> 03:27:09.290
You swore!

03:27:09.460 --> 03:27:11.540
You swore on the precious!

03:27:13.420 --> 03:27:15.380
Smeagol promised!

03:27:16.290 --> 03:27:18.300
Smeagol lied.

03:28:10.770 --> 03:28:12.690
Frodo!

03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:41.540
Eagles.

03:28:42.940 --> 03:28:44.460
The eagles are coming!

03:29:07.290 --> 03:29:09.160
Frodo!

03:29:14.380 --> 03:29:15.700
I'm here, Sam.

03:29:23.140 --> 03:29:24.800
Destroy it!

03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:38.640
Go on! Now!

03:29:38.780 --> 03:29:41.350
Throw it in the fire!

03:29:54.730 --> 03:29:57.420
What are you waiting for?

03:29:59.260 --> 03:30:01.670
Just let it go!

03:30:34.870 --> 03:30:37.110
The Ring is mine.

03:30:40.660 --> 03:30:42.410
No.

03:30:42.800 --> 03:30:44.120
No.

03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:55.220
No!

03:32:39.630 --> 03:32:41.530
Yes!

03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:44.410
Yes!

03:32:45.520 --> 03:32:48.410
Precious! Precious!

03:32:48.540 --> 03:32:51.750
Precious! Precious!

03:33:44.640 --> 03:33:46.510
Give me your hand!

03:33:54.860 --> 03:33:57.270
Take my hand!

03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:01.280
No!

03:34:08.520 --> 03:34:10.500
Don't you let go.

03:34:15.090 --> 03:34:16.660
Don't let go.

03:34:18.270 --> 03:34:19.760
Reach!

03:35:48.930 --> 03:35:51.800
Frodo!

03:35:52.370 --> 03:35:55.390
Frodo!

03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:18.590
It's gone.

03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:24.810
It's done.

03:37:25.270 --> 03:37:27.310
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

03:37:28.660 --> 03:37:31.100
It's over now.

03:37:56.760 --> 03:37:59.130
I can see the Shire.

03:38:01.350 --> 03:38:03.670
The Brandywine River.

03:38:05.780 --> 03:38:07.800
Bag End.

03:38:10.110 --> 03:38:12.850
Gandalf's fireworks.

03:38:13.240 --> 03:38:17.030
The lights in the Party Tree.

03:38:18.500 --> 03:38:21.650
Rosie Cotton dancing.

03:38:22.780 --> 03:38:25.490
She had ribbons in her hair.

03:38:28.410 --> 03:38:31.370
If ever I was to marry someone...

03:38:32.270 --> 03:38:34.540
it would've been her.

03:38:35.970 --> 03:38:38.040
It would've been her.

03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:53.400
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

03:38:57.650 --> 03:39:00.610
here at the end of all things.

03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:52.350
Gandalf?

03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:13.990
Frodo!

03:41:33.740 --> 03:41:35.590
Gimli!

03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:22.320
Now come the days of the king.

03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:29.660
May they be blessed.

03:43:49.920 --> 03:43:52.610
This day does not belong to one man...

03:43:52.730 --> 03:43:54.650
but to all.

03:43:56.280 --> 03:43:59.240
Let us together rebuild this world...

03:43:59.410 --> 03:44:03.650
that we may share in the days of peace.

03:44:15.780 --> 03:44:19.950
Et Earello...

03:44:20.210 --> 03:44:27.560
Endorenna utulien.

03:44:29.120 --> 03:44:32.980
Sinome maruvan...

03:44:33.820 --> 03:44:39.589
ar Hildinyar...

03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.760
- tenn' Ambar-metta.
- Ar Hildinyar...

03:44:39.761 --> 03:44:47.761
tenn' Ambar-metta.

03:44:58.110 --> 03:44:59.570
Hannon le.

03:46:38.100 --> 03:46:40.220
My friends...

03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:48.200
you bow to no one.

03:47:32.320 --> 03:47:34.490
And thus it was.

03:47:34.620 --> 03:47:38.280
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

03:47:38.420 --> 03:47:40.990
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

03:47:41.130 --> 03:47:45.660
though eternally bound by
friendship and love...

03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:48.240
was ended.

03:47:53.230 --> 03:47:58.050
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

03:47:58.180 --> 03:48:02.440
we found ourselves looking
upon a familiar sight.

03:48:04.960 --> 03:48:07.690
We were home.

03:48:14.240 --> 03:48:16.110
Hi.

03:48:33.270 --> 03:48:35.510
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

03:49:23.580 --> 03:49:25.180
More of the same, Rosie.

03:49:25.350 --> 03:49:27.340
Good night, lads.

03:50:24.890 --> 03:50:28.910
How do you pick up the
threads of an old life?

03:50:30.210 --> 03:50:32.450
How do you go on...

03:50:32.600 --> 03:50:37.830
when in your heart you
begin to understand...

03:50:39.070 --> 03:50:42.040
there is no going back?

03:50:42.720 --> 03:50:46.430
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

03:50:46.890 --> 03:50:49.850
some hurts that go too deep...

03:50:51.580 --> 03:50:54.440
that have taken hold.

03:51:32.560 --> 03:51:34.470
Mr. Frodo?

03:51:37.770 --> 03:51:39.190
What is it?

03:51:41.000 --> 03:51:44.980
It's been four years to the
day since Weathertop, Sam.

03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:48.360
It's never really healed.

03:51:52.320 --> 03:51:57.580
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

03:51:58.260 --> 03:52:02.120
And "The Lord of the
Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

03:52:02.590 --> 03:52:04.790
You finished it.

03:52:07.650 --> 03:52:09.170
Not quite.

03:52:09.940 --> 03:52:12.550
There's room for a little more.

03:52:15.150 --> 03:52:19.400
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

03:52:19.530 --> 03:52:22.850
that each of us must come
and go in the telling.

03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:26.570
Bilbo's story was now over.

03:52:27.040 --> 03:52:29.990
There would be no more journeys for him...

03:52:30.120 --> 03:52:31.700
save one.

03:52:32.410 --> 03:52:36.060
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

03:52:36.160 --> 03:52:38.200
To the harbor, Bilbo.

03:52:38.350 --> 03:52:41.080
The Elves have accorded
you a special honor...

03:52:41.220 --> 03:52:43.870
a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:47.250
Frodo...

03:52:48.670 --> 03:52:53.220
any chance of seeing that
old Ring of mine again?

03:52:53.840 --> 03:52:56.090
The one I gave you.

03:52:59.730 --> 03:53:01.890
I'm sorry, Uncle.

03:53:04.420 --> 03:53:07.060
I'm afraid I lost it.

03:53:07.230 --> 03:53:09.030
Oh.

03:53:09.580 --> 03:53:11.110
Pity.

03:53:13.860 --> 03:53:17.730
I should like to have
held it one last time.

03:53:46.860 --> 03:53:51.940
Well, here's a sight I
have never seen before.

03:54:06.090 --> 03:54:09.460
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

03:54:10.210 --> 03:54:13.040
The time has come...

03:54:13.180 --> 03:54:16.470
for the dominion of Men.

03:54:16.990 --> 03:54:20.470
I Aear can ven na mar.

03:54:28.880 --> 03:54:31.060
I think I'm...

03:54:31.220 --> 03:54:35.610
quite ready for another adventure.

03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:08.970
Farewell...

03:55:09.120 --> 03:55:11.900
my brave Hobbits.

03:55:13.820 --> 03:55:15.850
My work is now finished.

03:55:19.660 --> 03:55:24.660
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

03:55:25.290 --> 03:55:28.160
comes the end of our Fellowship.

03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:34.200
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:38.880
for not all tears are an evil.

03:55:56.410 --> 03:55:58.350
It is time, Frodo.

03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:05.900
What does he mean?

03:56:08.350 --> 03:56:11.240
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

03:56:12.830 --> 03:56:15.580
And it has been saved.

03:56:19.250 --> 03:56:21.920
But not for me.

03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:25.300
You don't mean that.

03:56:26.490 --> 03:56:28.590
You can't leave.

03:56:37.020 --> 03:56:39.770
The last pages are for you, Sam.

04:00:12.860 --> 04:00:15.730
My dear Sam

04:00:17.660 --> 04:00:20.990
You cannot always be torn in two.

04:00:21.150 --> 04:00:25.290
You will have to be one
and whole for many years.

04:00:25.890 --> 04:00:31.490
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

04:00:32.620 --> 04:00:35.920
Your part in the story will go on.

04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:38.420
Well...

04:00:40.280 --> 04:00:42.010
I'm back.
