00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.630
The world is changed.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.870
I feel it in the water.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.550
I feel it in the earth.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
I smell it in the air.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.430
Much that once was...

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.190
is lost.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.930
For none now live who remember it.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.210
It began with the forging
of the Great Rings.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.290
Three were given to the Elves:

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.290
Immortal, wisest and fairest
of all beings.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.420
Seven to the Dwarf-lords:

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.590
Great miners and craftsmen
of the mountain halls.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.300
And nine...

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.520
nine rings were gifted
to the race of Men...

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.560
who, above all else, desire power.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.900
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.580
But they were all of them deceived.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.910
For another ring was made.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.330
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.220
the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a Master Ring...

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.470
to control all others.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.630
And into this Ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.060
and his will to dominate all life.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.890
One Ring to rule them all.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.100
One by one...

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.270
the Free Lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the Ring.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.530
But there were some who resisted.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.660
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.500
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.450
Victory was near.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.960
But the power of the Ring...

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.210
could not be undone.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.730
It was in this moment...

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.320
when all hope had faded...

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.670
that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.240
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.290
The Ring passed to Isildur...

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.720
who had this one chance
to destroy evil forever.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550
But the hearts of Men...

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.260
are easily corrupted.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.140
And the Ring of Power
has a will of its own.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.960
It betrayed Isildur...

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.210
to his death.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.260
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.800
were lost.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.850
History became legend...

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.060
legend became myth.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.110
And for
two and a half thousand years...

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.020
the Ring passed
out of all knowledge.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.500
Until, when chance came...

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.280
it ensnared a new bearer.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.190
My precious.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.210
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.340
who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.510
And there it consumed him.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.770
It came to me.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.390
My own. My love. My own.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.170
My precious.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.370
The Ring brought to Gollum
unnatural long life.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.410
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.200
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave,
it waited.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.670
Darkness crept back
into the forests of the world.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.760
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.760
whispers of a nameless fear.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.260
And the Ring of Power perceived...

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.260
its time had now come.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.360
It abandoned Gollum.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.520
But something happened then
the Ring did not intend.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.940
It was picked up by the most unlikely
creature imaginable.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.190
What's this?

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.830
A Hobbit.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.790
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.750
A ring.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960
Lost!

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.050
My precious is lost!

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.550
For the time will soon come...

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.970
when Hobbits will shape
the fortunes of all.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.770
The 22nd day of September...

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.190
in the year 1400...

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.650
by Shire-reckoning.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.620
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
West farthing...

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.830
the Shire...

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.880
Middle-earth.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.850
The Third Age of this world.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.400
There and Back Again:

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.740
A Hobbit's Tale.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.860
By Bilbo Baggins.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.450
Now...

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.160
where to begin?

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.500
Ah, yes....

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.840
"Concerning...

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.550
Hobbits."

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.190
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.360
for many hundreds of years...

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.520
quite content to ignore
and be ignored...

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.900
by the world of the Big Folk.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.870
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.250
Hobbits must seem
of little importance...

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.450
being neither renowned
as great warriors...

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.830
nor counted among the very wise.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.220
Frodo! Someone at the door.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.970
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.600
that Hobbits' only real passion
is for food.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.140
A rather unfair observation...

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.030
as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.200
and the smoking of pipe-weed.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.490
But where our hearts truly lie...

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.780
is in peace and quiet...

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.660
and good, tilled earth.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.040
For all Hobbits share a love
of things that grow.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.550
And, yes, no doubt to others,
our ways seem quaint.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:14.010
But today of all days,
it is brought home to me:

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:20.560
It is no bad thing
to celebrate a simple life.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.900
Frodo, the door!

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.620
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.540
Frodo!

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.880
Down from the door where it began

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.420
And I must follow if I can

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.570
The road goes ever on and on

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.230
Down from the door where it began

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:07.400
Now far ahead the road has gone

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.820
- And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.910
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.340
Nor is he early. He arrives
precisely when he means to.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.770
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.360
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.200
How is the old rascal?

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.240
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.860
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.990
Well, that should please him.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.080
Half the Shire's been invited.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.960
And the rest of them are turning up
anyway.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.420
And so life in the Shire goes on...

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.640
very much as it has
this past Age...

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:19.359
..full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.360
If it comes at all.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.150
For things are made to endure
in the Shire...

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.860
passing from one generation
to the next.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:35.240
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.790
in Bag End.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.330
And there always will be.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.470
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.930
I mean, more than usual.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.850
He's taken to locking himself
in his study.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.600
He spends hours poring over old maps
when he thinks I'm not looking.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.990
Where's it gone?

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.890
He's up to something.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.530
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.470
But I know you have something
to do with it.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:55.740
Good gracious me.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.960
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.170
Indeed.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.590
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:09.050
If you're referring to the incident
with the dragon, I was barely involved.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.800
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.150
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.400
Oh, really?

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.020
Gandalf! Gandalf!

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.400
Fireworks, Gandalf!

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.120
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.020
Gandalf?

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.690
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.950
So am I.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.190
No, thank you!

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.360
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.080
And what about very old friends?

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.960
Gandalf?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.090
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.420
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.170
You haven't aged a day.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.810
Come on, come in!

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.400
Welcome, welcome.

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.570
Oh, here we are.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.190
Tea? Or maybe something
a little stronger?

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.190
I've got a few bottles
of the Old Winyard left. 1296.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.460
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:43.090
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.970
Just tea, thank you.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.020
I was expecting you sometime
last week.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.510
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.940
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only
got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.520
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.650
We've got raspberry jam,
an apple tart...

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.320
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.370
I've just found some sponge cake.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.730
I could make you some eggs
if you'd...

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.090
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.500
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.470
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.260
I'm not at home!

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.850
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.150
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.320
They've never forgiven me
for living this long.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.476
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.460
never giving me a moment's peace.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.670
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.420
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:09.550
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.010
All the arrangements are made.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.600
Oh, thank you.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.430
Frodo suspects something.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.100
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.940
not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.280
You will tell him, won't you?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.200
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.950
I know.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.670
He'd probably come with me
if I asked him.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.710
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.580
The woods, the fields.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.130
Little rivers.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.310
I am old, Gandalf.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.940
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.600
I feel thin.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.540
Sort of stretched...

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.120
like butter scraped
over too much bread.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.830
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.250
And I don't expect I shall return.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.670
In fact, I mean not to.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.430
Old Toby. The finest weed
in the South farthing.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.320
Gandalf, my old friend...

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.370
this will be a night to remember.

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.270
Hello, hello.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.570
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.150
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.320
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.170
Go on!

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.130
So there I was...

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.390
at the mercy
of three monstrous trolls.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.590
And they were all arguing
amongst themselves...

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.180
about how they were
going to cook us.

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.440
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.980
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.780
that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.280
and turned them all to stone!

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:23.960
Quickly.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.170
Up they go!

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.260
No, the big one.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.280
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.360
Are all these children yours?

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.570
Good gracious,
you have been productive.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.910
Bilbo?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.330
Sackville-Bagginses!

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.620
Quickly, hide!

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.710
Thank you, my boy.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.550
You're a good lad, Frodo.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.640
I'm very selfish, you know.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.560
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.059
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.780
but it wasn't out of charity.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.730
I think it was because...

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.270
of all my numerous relations...

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.080
you were the one Baggins
that showed real spirit.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.210
Bilbo, have you been
at the Gaffer's home brew?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420
No.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.950
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.460
The point is, Frodo...

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.550
you'll be all right.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.980
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:58.650
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.400
This was your idea.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.790
Bilbo.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.700
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.290
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for a thousand years.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.390
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.190
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.280
I might've known.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.240
Speech, Bilbo!

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.410
Speech!

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:01.660
Speech!

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.160
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.130
Tooks and Brandybucks...

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:14.840
Grubbs, Chubbs...

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.090
Hornblowers...

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.930
Bolgers...

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.860
Bracegirdles...

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.690
- and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.030
Today is my 111th birthday!

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.370
Happy birthday!

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.820
But alas, eleventy-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.950
such excellent
and admirable Hobbits.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.630
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.420
and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.770
I have things to do.

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.270
I've put this off far too long.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.070
I regret to announce this is the end!

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.410
I'm going now.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.410
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.000
Goodbye.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.370
I suppose you think
that was terribly clever.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.920
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:12.170
There are many magic rings in this world,
and none of them should be used lightly.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.550
It was just a bit of fun.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.470
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.390
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.280
As often as I can spare them.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.650
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.200
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.700
It's in an envelope over there
on the mantelpiece.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.740
No. Wait, it's...

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.960
here in my pocket.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.800
Isn't that...? Isn't that odd, now?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.970
Yet, after all, why not?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.400
- Why shouldn't I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.980
Is that so hard?

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.530
Well, no.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:13.910
And yes.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.490
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.450
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.880
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.130
It's mine.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.380
My own.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.170
- My precious.
- Precious?

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.260
It's been called that before,
but not by you.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.060
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.020
I think you've had that ring
quite long enough.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.070
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.530
Do not take me for some conjurer
of cheap tricks.

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.410
I am not trying to rob you.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.120
I'm trying to help you.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.930
All your long years,
we've been friends.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.470
Trust me as you once did.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.180
Let it go.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.730
You're right, Gandalf.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.520
The ring must go to Frodo.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.820
It's late. The road is long.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.530
Yes, it is time.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:44.330
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.070
I've thought up an ending for my book:

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.710
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.340
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:34.850
Goodbye, Gandalf.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.220
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.270
The road goes ever on and on

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.230
Until our next meeting.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.180
It's mine. My own.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.860
My precious.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.030
Riddles in the dark.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.650
Bilbo!

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.410
Bilbo!

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.000
My precious.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.800
Precious.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.550
He's gone, hasn't he?

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.390
He talked for so long about leaving...

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.300
I didn't think he'd really do it.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.680
Gandalf?

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.610
Bilbo's ring.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.330
He's gone to stay with the Elves.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.630
He's left you Bag End.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.740
Along with all his possessions.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.880
The ring is yours now.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.920
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.421
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.900
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.400
I don't understand.

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.730
Neither do I.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.280
Keep it secret.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.290
Keep it safe.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.280
Shire!

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.750
Baggins!

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.340
"The year 3434 of the Second Age.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:36.930
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.810
and the finding
of the Ring of Power."

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.140
"It has come to me.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.810
The One Ring. It shall be
an heirloom of my kingdom.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:53.440
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.440
for I will risk
no hurt to the Ring.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.150
It is precious to me...

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.660
though I buy it with great pain.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:11.010
The markings upon the band
begin to fade.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.050
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.310
A secret now
that only fire can tell."

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:37.910
Shire.

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.990
Baggins.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.540
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.750
That way.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.920
To heal my heart and drown my woe

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.430
Rain may fall and wind may blow

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.550
But there still be

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.180
Many miles to go

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.310
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.680
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.730
Better than rain or rippling brook

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.310
Is a mug of beer inside this Took

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.570
There's been some strange folk
crossing the Shire.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.870
Dwarves and others of a less
than savory nature.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.750
War is brewing.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.290
The mountains are fair teeming
with goblins.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.080
Far-off tales and children's stories,
that's all that is.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.760
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.930
Young Mr. Frodo here,
he's cracking.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.520
And proud of it.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.970
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Cheers.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.270
It's none of our concern what goes on
beyond our borders.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:52.780
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.320
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:03.000
Good night, sweet maiden
of the golden ale.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.540
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.300
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot
when she sees one.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.500
Does she?

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.170
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mister Frodo.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.400
Is it secret? Is it safe?

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.420
What are you doing?

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:09.560
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:10.940
It's quite cool.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.240
What can you see?

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.400
Can you see anything?

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.500
Nothing.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.160
There's nothing.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.750
Wait.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.080
There are markings.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.970
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.760
There are few who can.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:49.140
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:50.810
Mordor!

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.100
In the common tongue, it says:

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.820
"One Ring to rule them all...

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:59.360
One Ring to find them...

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.780
One Ring to bring them all...

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.080
and in the darkness bind them."

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.750
This is the One Ring...

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.210
forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:18.470
Taken by Isildur
from the hand of Sauron himself.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.800
Bilbo found it.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.180
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.940
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet
in Bilbo's keeping...

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.520
prolonging his life,
delaying old age.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.570
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.190
The Ring has awoken.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.170
It's heard its master's call.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.240
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:55.040
No, Frodo.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.300
The spirit of Sauron endured.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.850
His life force is bound to the Ring,
and the Ring survived.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.310
Sauron has returned.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.310
His Orcs have multiplied.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.530
His fortress at Barad-dur
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.530
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:21.780
He is seeking it.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.860
Seeking it. All his thought
is bent on it.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.790
For the Ring yearns above all else...

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.420
to return to the hand
of its master.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.380
They are one...

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.680
the Ring and the Dark Lord.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:38.920
Frodo...

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.350
he must never find it.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.590
All right.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:47.230
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.110
No one knows it's here, do they?

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.980
Do they, Gandalf?

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.450
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:05.700
I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.040
But the enemy found him first.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.250
I don't know how long
they tortured him.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.930
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.140
Shire!

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.100
Baggins!

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:23.100
Shire.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:26.180
Baggins. But that would
lead them here!

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.060
Who goes there?

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.020
Take it, Gandalf!

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.440
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.030
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.580
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.330
I dare not take it.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.120
Not even to keep it safe.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.250
Understand, Frodo...

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.540
I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:05.680
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:09.190
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.690
No, it can't.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.410
What must I do?

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.620
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.080
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.460
Bree.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:32.420
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.090
at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.000
- And the Ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.220
I don't have any answers.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:48.270
I must see the head of my order. He is
both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.600
He'll know what to do.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.070
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.770
That name is not safe
outside the Shire.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.730
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.580
I can cut across country
easily enough.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.410
My dear Frodo.

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.710
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.840
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.380
And yet, after a hundred years...

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.640
they can still surprise you.

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.600
Get down.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.270
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.950
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.570
A little late for trimming the verge,
don't you think?

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.630
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.950
Nothing important.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.580
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring,
a Dark Lord and the end of the world but...

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:59.550
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.270
No?

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.210
Perhaps not.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.890
I've thought of a better use for you.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.650
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.360
Be careful, both of you.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:20.410
The enemy has many spies
in his service:

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:23.580
Birds, beasts.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.160
Is it safe?

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.210
Never put it on...

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.790
for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.500
Always remember, Frodo...

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.180
the Ring is trying to get back
to its master.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.680
It wants to be found.

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.470
This is it.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:26.930
This is what?

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.350
If I take one more step...

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.730
it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:39.440
Come on, Sam.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:49.750
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:54.040
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:58.670
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.050
there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:17.910
Sam.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.320
Wood-elves.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.590
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.880
To the Grey Havens.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.470
They're leaving Middle-earth.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.890
Never to return.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.890
I don't know why...

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.980
it makes me sad.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:02.690
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.120
Just shut your eyes...

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.090
and imagine you're back
in your own bed...

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:12.210
with a soft mattress
and a lovely feather pillow.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.180
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.260
I'm never going to be able
to sleep out here.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.980
Me neither, Sam.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:03.510
Smoke rises
from the Mountain of Doom.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.350
The hour grows late.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.150
And Gandalf the Grey
rides to Isengard...

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.770
seeking my counsel.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:15.930
For that is why you have come,
is it not?

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.440
My old friend.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.320
Saruman.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.120
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.200
So the Ring of Power has been found.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.620
All these long years,
it was in the Shire.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.040
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.050
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:46.930
But we still have time. Time enough
to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.640
Time?

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:52.230
What time do you think we have?

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:56.480
Sauron has regained
much of his former strength.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.900
He cannot yet take physical form...

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.820
but his spirit has lost
none of its potency.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.570
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:14.080
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow,
earth and flesh.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:18.710
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.880
A Great Eye, lidless,
wreathed in flame.

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.640
The Eye of Sauron.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.430
He is gathering all evil to him.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.769
Very soon, he'll have summoned
an army...

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.730
great enough for an assault
upon Middle-earth.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.440
You know this?

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.480
How?

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.740
I have seen it.

00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.370
A palantir is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.580
Why?

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.750
Why should we fear to use it?

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:58.330
They are not all accounted for,
the lost Seeing-stones.

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:01.760
We do not know who else
may be watching.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.050
The hour is later than you think.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.590
Sauron's forces are already moving.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:14.610
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.020
The Nine?

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.240
They crossed the River Isen
on Midsummer's Eve...

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.120
disguised as riders in black.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:26.280
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the Ring.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.120
And kill the one who carries it.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:32.120
Frodo!

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:49.140
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.690
There are none who can.

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:57.900
Against the power of Mordor...

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.740
there can be no victory.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.870
We must join with him, Gandalf.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.490
We must join with Sauron.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.840
It would be wise, my friend.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.760
Tell me...

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.000
friend...

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:23.560
when did Saruman the Wise
abandon reason for madness?

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.760
I gave you the chance...

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.520
of aiding me willingly...

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:12.890
but you have elected
the way of pain!

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.710
Mr. Frodo?

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.090
Frodo? Frodo!

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:44.720
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you talking about?

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:47.930
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.640
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.520
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:00.520
Frodo.

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.030
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.620
Get off him.

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.580
Come on, Frodo.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.660
What's the meaning of this?

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:12.210
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.500
You get back here!

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:17.790
Get out of my field!

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.840
You'll know the devil
if I catch up with you!

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.970
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.260
And some cabbages.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.400
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.650
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.020
he's clearly overreacting.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.730
Run!

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:52.750
Oh, that was close.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.960
I think I've broken something.

00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:00.300
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.130
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.590
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.860
That's mine.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.240
That's nice, Merry.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.780
Here's a nice one, Sam.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.530
I think we should get off the road.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.090
Get off the road!

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.790
Quick!

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.980
Be quiet!

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.460
What was that?

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:35.670
Anything?

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:37.840
Nothing.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:40.840
What is going on?

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:45.170
That Black Rider was looking
for something. Or someone.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.010
Frodo?

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.720
Get down!

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.870
I have to leave the Shire.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.160
Sam and I must get to Bree.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.840
Right.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:17.450
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:27.090
Run!

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:30.300
This way! Follow me!

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:34.930
Run!

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:49.990
Get the rope, Sam!

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:54.170
Frodo!

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.290
Run, Frodo!

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.710
Go!
- Hurry!

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.550
Frodo, come on!

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.510
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:22.660
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.750
Come on.

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:53.390
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.700
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:03.860
What's more, out of the Shire by your
talk. What business brings you to Bree?

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:07.450
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.110
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.830
It's my job to ask questions
after night fall.

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.880
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:19.250
Can't be too careful.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:42.440
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.100
Excuse me.

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.900
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:18.190
If you're seeking accommodation, we got
some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:23.070
Always proud to cater
to the Little Folk, Mister...?

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.200
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

00:59:27.450 --> 00:59:29.940
- Underhill, yes.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.330
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.500
Gandalf.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:38.000
Oh, yes...

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:40.290
I remember. Elderly chap.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.590
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:45.800
Not seen him for six months.

00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:53.890
What do we do now?

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:02.310
Sam...

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:04.410
he'll be here. He'll come.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.240
Get out of my way!

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.290
What's that?

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.990
This, my friend, is a pint.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.840
It comes in pints?

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:21.920
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:32.100
That fellow's done nothing
but stare at you since we arrived.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:37.140
Excuse me.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.950
That Man in the corner. Who is he?

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.490
He's one of them Rangers. They're
dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:52.280
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but around here he's known as Strider.

01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:55.870
Strider.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.940
Baggins.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.150
Baggins.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.740
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.380
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.620
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.080
and my third cousin, twice removed...

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.390
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.380
You cannot hide.

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:25.460
I see you.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.850
There is no life...

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.220
in the void.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.930
Only...

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.350
death.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:47.240
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:52.900
What do you want?

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.520
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.590
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:01.370
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.300
but to disappear entirely,
that is a rare gift.

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.430
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.630
Yes.

01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.770
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.320
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:27.070
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:30.210
You can no longer wait
for the wizard, Frodo.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.500
They're coming.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.580
What are they?

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.880
They were once Men.

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.300
Great kings of Men.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.970
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.680
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.180
One by one, falling into darkness.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.890
Now they are slaves to his will.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.990
They are the Nazgul.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.900
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.070
At all times they feel...

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.190
the presence of the Ring...

01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:32.950
drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:45.880
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the Wild.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.110
How do we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.150
I think a servant of the enemy
would look fairer...

01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:05.440
- and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:08.870
We have no choice but to trust him.

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:12.490
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.160
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.510
We're going to see the Elves.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.370
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.250
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.660
What about second breakfast?

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:59.250
Don't think he knows
about second breakfast, Pip.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:04.670
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:09.050
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.150
Pippin!

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:36.120
What do they eat
when they can't get Hobbit?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.170
Who is she?

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.450
This woman you sing of.

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:26.260
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:31.630
The Elf-maiden who gave her love
to Beren, a mortal.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:35.600
What happened to her?

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.310
She died.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.690
Get some sleep, Frodo.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.040
The power of Isengard
is at your command...

01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:05.670
Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:14.800
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.860
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.230
We have work to do.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:14.490
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:16.710
Rip them all down.

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:47.030
This was the great watchtower
of Amon Sul.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.360
We shall rest here tonight.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.500
These are for you.
Keep them close.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:09.210
I'm going to have a look around.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.470
Stay here.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.180
My tomato's burst.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.310
Could I have some bacon?

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:22.480
Want a tomato, Sam?

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:26.530
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:29.410
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.620
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.090
Go!

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:38.720
Back, you devils!

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.440
Frodo!

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.400
Oh, Sam.

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:47.440
Strider!

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.710
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

01:14:57.170 --> 01:15:02.080
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.710
Hurry!

01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:11.880
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.970
Hold on, Frodo.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.550
Gandalf!

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.640
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:02.690
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.320
Is he going to die?

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:12.410
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:21.370
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:23.050
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.380
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:27.710
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:46.230
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.130
Frodo.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.220
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:21.480
Hear my voice...

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.860
Come back to the light.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:30.820
Who is she?

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.240
Frodo.

01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:37.040
- She's an Elf.
- He's fading.

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:41.490
He's not going to last.

01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.380
We must get him to my father.

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:47.960
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:54.300
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.800
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.

01:19:58.020 --> 01:19:59.680
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.900
The Road is too dangerous.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:03.270
What are they saying?

01:20:03.570 --> 01:20:05.610
If I can get across the river...

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.390
the power of my people
will protect him.

01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:10.980
I do not fear them.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.250
Arwen...

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:25.670
ride hard. Don't look back.

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:35.050
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.430
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:35.930
If you want him, come and claim him.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:30.820
No. No!

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.860
Frodo, no.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.370
Frodo, don't give in.

01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:42.580
Not now.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:56.010
What grace is given me...

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.510
let it pass to him.

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.890
Let him be spared.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.560
Save him.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.160
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:28.090
And it is 10:00 in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:33.800
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:38.550
And you're lucky to be here too.

01:24:39.230 --> 01:24:43.230
A few more hours and you
would have been beyond our aid.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.570
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.700
What happened, Gandalf?

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:04.040
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.510
I was delayed.

01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:15.600
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:24.440
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:27.480
Embrace the power of the Ring...

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.610
or embrace your own destruction!

01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:36.780
There is only one Lord of the Ring.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Only one who can bend it to his will.

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.790
And he does not share power.

01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:03.480
So you have chosen death.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:17.360
Gandalf? What is it?

01:26:18.330 --> 01:26:20.120
Nothing, Frodo.

01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:22.700
Frodo!

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:26.460
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:29.430
Sam has hardly left your side.

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.840
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:37.300
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:42.390
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:33.740
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:35.660
Bilbo.

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.420
"There and Back Again:

01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:45.420
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins."

01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:52.050
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:56.170
wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.920
visit Lake-town...

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.560
see the Lonely Mountain again.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.890
But age, it seems,
has finally caught up with me.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.790
I miss the Shire.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:27.370
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

01:28:27.630 --> 01:28:31.250
Off with you,
on one of your adventures.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:37.800
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:46.230
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.640
My dear boy.

01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:57.730
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:00.330
No harm in being prepared.

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.080
- I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
- I do.

01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:06.170
- More than anything.
- I did.

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:08.290
It's just....

01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:11.670
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:15.550
We got the Ring this far,
to Rivendell. And I thought...

01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:19.050
seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:20.980
Off home.

01:29:25.150 --> 01:29:27.140
You are right, Sam.

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.070
We did what we set out to do.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.190
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.

01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.660
I am ready to go home.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.460
His strength returns.

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:50.380
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

01:29:50.970 --> 01:29:53.460
And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.380
the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.970
It is a burden he should never
have had to bear.

01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:06.600
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:11.480
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.450
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.860
Our list of allies grows thin.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.410
His treachery runs deeper
than you know.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:25.240
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.920
He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.800
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.380
Saruman is coming for the Ring.

01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:39.890
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:44.480
We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:49.390
Gandalf...

01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.280
the Ring cannot stay here.

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.050
This peril belongs
to all Middle-earth.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:18.970
They must decide now how to end it.

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.600
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

01:31:24.270 --> 01:31:27.860
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:33.150
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:37.620
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.660
Men?

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:43.740
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:48.370
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:52.210
It is because of Men
the Ring survives.

01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:54.050
I was there, Gandalf.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.560
I was there 3000 years ago...

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:06.770
when Isildur took the Ring.

01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:10.850
I was there the day
the strength of Men failed.

01:32:13.410 --> 01:32:15.980
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:21.200
I led Isildur into the heart
of Mount Doom...

01:32:21.410 --> 01:32:24.950
where the Ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:27.740
Cast it into the fire!

01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.720
- Destroy it!
- No.

01:32:38.060 --> 01:32:40.220
Isildur!

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:45.390
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:53.780
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.

01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:58.320
There's no strength left
in the world of Men.

01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:03.370
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:06.920
One who could reclaim
the throne of Gondor.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.420
He turned from that path
a long time ago.

01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:14.760
He has chosen exile.

01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:47.790
You are no Elf.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.080
Men of the South are welcome here.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.260
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.510
Then we are here on common purpose...

01:33:58.930 --> 01:34:00.340
friend.

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:18.490
The shards of Narsil.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.460
The blade that cut the Ring
from Sauron's hand.

01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:31.580
It's still sharp.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.560
But no more than a broken heirloom.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:13.420
Why do you fear the past?

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:19.680
You are Isildur's heir,
not Isildur himself.

01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:23.310
You are not bound to his fate.

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:27.810
The same blood flows in my veins.

01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:33.400
The same weakness.

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.870
Your time will come.

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:43.490
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

01:35:46.710 --> 01:35:49.120
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:53.710
Not over you... not over me.

01:36:05.110 --> 01:36:08.310
Do you remember when we first met?

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:16.410
I thought I had strayed into a dream.

01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:19.440
Long years have passed.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.530
You did not have the cares you carry now.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.040
Do you remember what l told you?

01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:36.720
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:43.720
forsaking the immortal life
of your people.

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:46.770
And to that I hold.

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:50.600
I would rather share
one lifetime with you...

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:54.650
than face all the Ages
of this world alone.

01:37:03.460 --> 01:37:06.910
I choose a mortal life.

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:12.500
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.260
like my heart.

01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:37.740
Strangers from distant lands,
friends of old...

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:41.900
you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:47.420
Middle-earth stands upon the brink
of destruction. None can escape it.

01:37:47.630 --> 01:37:51.170
You will unite, or you will fall.

01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:55.630
Each race is bound to this fate,
this one doom.

01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.010
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:16.780
So it is true.

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.340
In a dream...

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:41.180
I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.180
but in the West
a pale light lingered.

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.770
A voice was crying:

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.940
"Your doom is near at hand.

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:52.700
Isildur's Bane is found."

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.530
Isildur's Bane.

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.400
Boromir!

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.560
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:31.469
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...

01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:33.610
for the Black Speech of Mordor...

01:39:33.860 --> 01:39:35.240
may yet be heard...

01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:38.370
in every corner of the West!

01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.280
The Ring is altogether evil.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.120
It is a gift.

01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:45.780
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.500
Why not use this Ring?

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:51.470
Long has my father,
the Steward of Gondor...

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.010
kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

01:39:56.260 --> 01:39:58.510
are your lands kept safe.

01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:04.640
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.600
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.

01:40:09.190 --> 01:40:13.270
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:17.020
And what would a Ranger know
of this matter?

01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:19.320
This is no mere Ranger.

01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:23.950
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:27.380
You owe him your allegiance.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.380
Aragorn.

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.960
This is Isildur's heir?

01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:43.060
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

01:40:45.190 --> 01:40:46.650
Sit down, Legolas.

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:52.780
Gondor has no king.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.360
Gondor needs no king.

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.700
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

01:41:07.710 --> 01:41:11.210
You have only one choice.

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.750
The Ring must be destroyed.

01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:21.590
What are we waiting for?

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.730
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,
son of Gloin...

01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:41.160
by any craft that we here possess.

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:45.830
The Ring was made in the fires
of Mount Doom.

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:49.870
Only there can it be unmade.

01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:53.540
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.720
and cast back into the fiery chasm
from whence it came.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.720
One of you...

01:42:03.230 --> 01:42:05.390
must do this.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.020
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:16.560
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:21.540
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:25.990
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:28.790
It is a barren wasteland...

01:42:29.010 --> 01:42:32.590
riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.630
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:41.140
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:45.810
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:48.590
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:53.480
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:58.940
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:03.440
Never trust an Elf!

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:10.460
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.670
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:34.690
I will take it.

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.200
I will take it.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.080
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:57.420
Though...

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.350
I do not know the way.

01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:08.690
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:12.270
as long as it is yours to bear.

01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:16.440
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.530
I will.

01:44:21.780 --> 01:44:24.070
You have my sword.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.950
And you have my bow.

01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:31.040
And my axe.

01:44:38.050 --> 01:44:41.060
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.730
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

01:44:47.190 --> 01:44:49.640
then Gondor will see it done.

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.980
- Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- It is hardly possible to separate you...

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:02.070
even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.570
We're coming too!

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:09.370
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:12.960
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:14.580
mission.

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:16.260
Quest.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:17.750
Thing.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.340
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

01:45:23.890 --> 01:45:25.800
Nine companions.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.430
So be it.

01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.810
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

01:45:33.450 --> 01:45:35.270
Great!

01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:37.770
Where are we going?

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:15.460
She wanted to protect her child...

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.080
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:26.760
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:28.930
That you'd never escape your fate.

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:33.100
The skill of the Elves
can reforge the sword of kings...

01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:37.440
but only you have the power
to wield it.

01:46:38.490 --> 01:46:40.900
I do not want that power.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:43.820
I have never wanted it.

01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:47.690
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:54.580
My old sword! Sting.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:55.960
Here, take it. Take it.

01:47:01.470 --> 01:47:05.340
- It's so light.
- Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:10.220
The blade glows blue
when Orcs are close.

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:15.020
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.690
Here's a pretty thing.

01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:19.390
Mithril.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.580
As light as a feather,
and as hard as dragon scales.

01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:28.040
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

01:47:36.090 --> 01:47:38.130
My old ring.

01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:43.300
I should very much like...

01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:47.560
to hold it again, one last time.

01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:08.580
I'm sorry I brought this upon you,
my boy.

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:13.000
I'm sorry that you
must carry this burden.

01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:20.590
I'm sorry for everything.

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.780
The Ring-bearer is setting out
on the Quest of Mount Doom.

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.740
On you who travel with him,
no oath...

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.080
nor bond is laid to go further
than you will.

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:53.040
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:57.420
May the blessings of Elves and Men...

01:48:57.970 --> 01:49:00.590
and all Free Folk go with you.

01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:07.770
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.

01:49:26.170 --> 01:49:28.660
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:31.040
Left.

01:50:50.670 --> 01:50:55.090
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.050
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:02.800
From there, our road
turns east to Mordor.

01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:06.850
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:09.680
Move your feet.

01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:11.230
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:12.860
Faster!

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:17.980
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.960
I'd say we were taking
the long way 'round.

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:24.540
Gandalf, we could pass through
the Mines of Moria.

01:51:25.170 --> 01:51:29.030
My cousin Balin would give us
a royal welcome.

01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:34.600
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:45.020
Sorry!

01:51:45.730 --> 01:51:47.220
Get him!

01:51:48.690 --> 01:51:51.150
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

01:51:51.690 --> 01:51:54.070
Gentlemen, that's enough.

01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:59.450
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

01:51:59.910 --> 01:52:02.530
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:05.450
It's moving fast.

01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:07.870
Against the wind.

01:52:08.630 --> 01:52:10.750
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:13.720
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

01:52:47.130 --> 01:52:48.840
Spies of Saruman.

01:52:49.630 --> 01:52:52.880
The passage south is being watched.

01:52:54.010 --> 01:52:57.350
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.

01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:11.690
Frodo!

01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.960
Boromir.

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:37.390
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.720
over so small a thing.

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:45.900
Such a little thing.

01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:47.570
Boromir!

01:53:48.190 --> 01:53:50.860
Give the Ring to Frodo.

01:54:00.710 --> 01:54:02.750
As you wish.

01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:05.500
I care not.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.590
So, Gandalf, you try
to lead them over Caradhras.

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:50.380
And if that fails,
where then will you go?

01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:54.630
If the mountain defeats you...

01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:59.310
will you risk
a more dangerous road?

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:14.580
There is a fell voice on the air.

01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:17.160
It's Saruman!

01:55:26.090 --> 01:55:30.750
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

01:55:30.970 --> 01:55:31.970
No!

01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:41.080
We must get off the mountain!

01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:45.870
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:49.460
The Gap of Rohan takes us
too close to Isengard!

01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.380
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:56.430
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.

01:56:58.270 --> 01:57:02.100
Moria. You fear to go
into those mines.

01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:07.820
The Dwarves delved too greedily
and too deep.

01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:13.490
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dum:

01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:18.290
Shadow and flame.

01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:24.380
Let the Ring-bearer decide.

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.180
We cannot stay here!

01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:34.140
This will be the death of the Hobbits.

01:57:34.350 --> 01:57:36.010
Frodo?

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.940
We will go through the mines.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.640
So be it.

01:57:51.240 --> 01:57:55.110
Frodo, come and help an old man.

01:57:58.670 --> 01:58:00.880
How is your shoulder?

01:58:01.090 --> 01:58:04.340
- Better than it was.
- And the Ring?

01:58:05.930 --> 01:58:08.420
You feel its power growing, don't you?

01:58:08.890 --> 01:58:11.810
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:16.100
Evil will be drawn to you
from outside the Fellowship.

01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:18.890
And, I fear, from within.

01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:25.650
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:28.700
Trust your own strengths.

01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:31.450
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.700
for good or for evil.

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:36.200
Some are greater than I am.

01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:40.370
And against some I have not yet
been tested.

01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:43.130
The walls...

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.920
of Moria.

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:54.640
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

01:58:54.850 --> 01:58:59.310
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

01:58:59.650 --> 01:59:02.110
Why doesn't that surprise me?

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.450
Well, let's see.

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:15.080
Ithildin.

01:59:15.710 --> 01:59:19.080
It mirrors only starlight
and moonlight.

01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:37.220
It reads, "The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.

01:59:37.820 --> 01:59:42.440
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

01:59:42.650 --> 01:59:47.400
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak
the password and the doors will open.

02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:12.300
Nothing's happening.

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.570
I once knew every spell
in all the tongues of Elves...

02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:26.610
Men and Orcs.

02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:28.150
What are you going to do, then?

02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:30.580
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:32.790
And if that does not shatter them...

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.670
and I am allowed a little peace
from foolish questions...

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.330
I will try to find the opening words.

02:00:52.190 --> 02:00:54.720
Mines are no place for a pony.

02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:59.100
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:03.070
Go on, Bill. Go on.

02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:07.150
Don't worry, Sam,
he knows the way home.

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.530
Do not disturb the water.

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.630
Oh, it's useless.

02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:33.470
It's a riddle.

02:01:36.230 --> 02:01:39.350
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:42.650
What's the Elvish word for "friend"?

02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:45.360
Mellon.

02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:08.300
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.

02:02:08.770 --> 02:02:14.470
Roaring fires, malt beer,
ripe meat off the bone!

02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:19.070
This, my friend,
is the home of my cousin Balin.

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.810
And they call it a mine.

02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:23.990
A mine!

02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:28.370
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:36.080
No...

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.340
No!

02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:43.180
Goblins.

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:51.400
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.010
Now, get out of here. Get out!

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:00.190
- Frodo!
- Help!

02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:01.980
Strider!

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.950
- Help!
- Get off him!

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.190
Aragorn!

02:03:16.630 --> 02:03:17.660
Frodo!

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.030
Into the mines!

02:03:45.250 --> 02:03:48.450
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

02:03:52.750 --> 02:03:54.500
Run!

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.980
We now have but one choice.

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:20.070
We must face the long dark of Moria.

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.280
Be on your guard.

02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:25.910
There are older
and fouler things than Orcs...

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.660
in the deep places of the world.

02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:41.550
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:45.600
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:35.060
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.650
or jewels...

02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:40.900
but mithril.

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:04.140
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:08.310
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:10.400
I never told him...

02:06:10.610 --> 02:06:15.570
but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.630
Pippin.

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:52.940
I have no memory of this place.

02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:56.400
- Are we lost?
- No.

02:06:56.620 --> 02:06:59.150
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

02:06:59.370 --> 02:07:00.830
- Merry?
- What?

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.950
I'm hungry.

02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:18.760
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

02:07:18.970 --> 02:07:23.100
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:27.470
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dur?
- Escaped...

02:07:28.190 --> 02:07:29.820
or was set loose.

02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:33.980
Now the Ring has brought him here.

02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:39.370
He will never be rid of his need for it.

02:07:39.580 --> 02:07:45.250
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:50.290
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:56.460
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

02:07:57.430 --> 02:08:00.220
Before it drove him mad.

02:08:00.480 --> 02:08:03.350
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:04.760
Pity?

02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:08.770
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

02:08:09.650 --> 02:08:14.860
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.780
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

02:08:21.210 --> 02:08:25.150
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.300
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:34.800
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:38.470
before this is over.

02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:43.810
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

02:08:50.490 --> 02:08:53.820
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.280
I wish none of this had happened.

02:08:57.490 --> 02:09:02.530
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

02:09:03.330 --> 02:09:08.840
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:14.340
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:17.180
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

02:09:17.690 --> 02:09:21.650
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.250
And that is an encouraging thought.

02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:31.640
It's that way.

02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.650
- He's remembered.
- No.

02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:38.650
But the air doesn't smell
so foul down here.

02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:44.080
If in doubt, Meriadoc,
always follow your nose.

02:09:58.890 --> 02:10:03.060
Let me risk a little more light.

02:10:07.690 --> 02:10:08.690
Behold...

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:15.440
the great realm
and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:21.330
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:47.990
Gimli!

02:10:55.410 --> 02:10:57.030
No!

02:10:59.620 --> 02:11:00.620
Oh, no.

02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:05.870
No.

02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:15.170
"Here lies Balin...

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:17.630
son of Fundin...

02:11:17.930 --> 02:11:20.560
Lord of Moria."

02:11:21.650 --> 02:11:23.310
He is dead, then.

02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:26.730
It's as I feared.

02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:47.880
We must move on. We cannot linger.

02:11:48.090 --> 02:11:52.800
"They have taken the bridge
and the second hall.

02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:56.460
We have barred the gates...

02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:59.600
but cannot hold them for long.

02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:02.650
The ground shakes.

02:12:03.070 --> 02:12:04.640
Drums...

02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:08.400
drums in the deep.

02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:13.990
We cannot get out.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.830
A Shadow moves in the dark.

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:24.080
We cannot get out.

02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:29.000
They are coming."

02:13:12.060 --> 02:13:13.880
Fool of a Took!

02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:18.050
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity!

02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:45.800
Frodo!

02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:49.550
Orcs!

02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:58.550
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:07.610
They have a cave-troll.

02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:24.590
Let them come!

02:14:25.090 --> 02:14:28.630
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:50.290
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.750
Frodo!

02:17:30.290 --> 02:17:32.160
Aragorn! Aragorn!

02:17:33.170 --> 02:17:35.040
Frodo!

02:18:20.220 --> 02:18:22.090
Frodo!

02:19:22.330 --> 02:19:23.600
Oh, no!

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.910
He's alive.

02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:39.330
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

02:19:39.550 --> 02:19:41.760
You should be dead.

02:19:41.970 --> 02:19:44.460
That spear would have skewered
a wild boar.

02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:49.430
I think there's more to this Hobbit
than meets the eye.

02:19:55.320 --> 02:19:56.350
Mithril.

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:01.780
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.

02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:09.700
To the Bridge of Khazad-dum!

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.430
This way!

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.800
What is this new devilry?

02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:58.650
A Balrog.

02:21:58.990 --> 02:22:02.110
A demon of the ancient world.

02:22:04.330 --> 02:22:06.740
This foe is beyond any of you.

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:09.500
Run!

02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:18.340
Quickly!

02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:36.230
Gandalf.

02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:38.440
Lead them on, Aragorn.

02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:42.360
The bridge is near.

02:22:44.410 --> 02:22:48.540
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:19.400
Gandalf!

02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:38.930
Merry! Pippin!

02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:51.570
Sam!

02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:57.530
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:01.990
Not the beard!

02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:17.130
Steady.

02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:20.880
Hold on!

02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:43.150
Hang on!

02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:55.670
Lean forward!

02:24:58.680 --> 02:24:59.710
Steady.

02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:02.180
Come on!

02:25:02.390 --> 02:25:03.390
Now!

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:22.910
Over the bridge!

02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.700
Fly!

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:11.340
You cannot pass!

02:26:11.550 --> 02:26:13.130
Gandalf!

02:26:17.390 --> 02:26:22.270
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:27.060
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udun!

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.000
Go back to the Shadow.

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:51.300
You shall not pass!

02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:22.320
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:32.470
Fly, you fools!

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:37.600
No!

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:47.060
Aragorn!

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:47.170
Legolas, get them up.

02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:53.140
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

02:28:53.350 --> 02:28:56.970
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

02:28:57.180 --> 02:29:00.520
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien.

02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:04.720
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:08.440
On your feet, Sam.

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:10.280
Frodo?

02:29:12.330 --> 02:29:14.030
Frodo!

02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:09.090
Stay close, young Hobbits!

02:30:09.850 --> 02:30:13.970
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:16.720
An Elf-witch...

02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:20.140
of terrible power.

02:30:20.690 --> 02:30:22.900
All who look upon her...

02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:24.900
fall under her spell.

02:30:25.110 --> 02:30:26.390
Frodo!

02:30:28.660 --> 02:30:30.700
And are never seen again.

02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:35.400
Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.

02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:39.320
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:41.290
Mr. Frodo?

02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:52.180
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

02:30:52.390 --> 02:30:56.930
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:09.190
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:16.320
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

02:31:17.250 --> 02:31:19.920
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:24.420
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

02:31:25.050 --> 02:31:26.460
you are known to us.

02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:29.590
So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

02:31:29.810 --> 02:31:31.680
Speak words we can all understand!

02:31:31.890 --> 02:31:36.470
We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

02:31:36.730 --> 02:31:39.270
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

02:31:46.110 --> 02:31:48.070
That was not so courteous.

02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:58.670
You bring great evil with you.

02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:02.630
You can go no further.

02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:42.670
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.710
Nor would he have you give up hope.

02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:50.560
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:54.510
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

02:32:57.360 --> 02:32:59.400
You will follow me.

02:33:11.120 --> 02:33:13.080
Caras Galadhon.

02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:16.630
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:22.510
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:44.720
The enemy knows you have entered here.

02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:50.550
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

02:34:52.310 --> 02:34:56.720
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

02:34:56.980 --> 02:34:58.780
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

02:34:58.990 --> 02:35:02.070
For I much desire to speak with him.

02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:05.070
I can no longer see him from afar.

02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:11.110
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

02:35:11.370 --> 02:35:13.830
He has fallen into Shadow.

02:35:18.510 --> 02:35:23.000
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:28.380
A Balrog of Morgoth.

02:35:29.100 --> 02:35:32.470
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

02:35:34.610 --> 02:35:37.860
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

02:35:38.490 --> 02:35:41.770
We do not yet know his full purpose.

02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:50.830
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dum fill your heart...

02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.370
Gimli, son of Gloin.

02:35:54.380 --> 02:35:57.910
For the world has grown
full of peril...

02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:02.010
and in all lands...

02:36:02.220 --> 02:36:05.720
love is now mingled with grief.

02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:21.070
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:24.620
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:30.830
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

02:36:31.050 --> 02:36:34.130
Stray but a little and it will fail...

02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:37.720
to the ruin of all.

02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:47.890
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:54.180
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

02:36:54.610 --> 02:36:58.280
for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

02:37:00.530 --> 02:37:02.660
Tonight, you will sleep...

02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:06.370
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:09.620
one who has seen the Eye!

02:37:24.270 --> 02:37:26.840
A lament for Gandalf.

02:37:34.110 --> 02:37:35.650
What do they say about him?

02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:38.520
I have not the heart to tell you.

02:37:41.410 --> 02:37:43.650
For me, the grief is still too near.

02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:49.410
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

02:37:49.630 --> 02:37:52.660
There should be a verse about them.

02:37:56.220 --> 02:37:58.210
The finest rockets ever seen

02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:02.180
They burst in stars of blue and green

02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:08.310
Or after thunder, silver showers

02:38:09.020 --> 02:38:11.770
Came falling like a rain of flowers

02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:15.900
Oh, that doesn't do them justice
by a long road.

02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:27.580
Take some rest.

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:32.130
These borders are well-protected.

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:34.880
I will find no rest here.

02:38:37.720 --> 02:38:40.720
I heard her voice inside my head.

02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:44.670
She spoke of my father
and the fall of Gondor.

02:38:44.890 --> 02:38:50.350
She said to me,
"Even now there is hope left."

02:38:51.730 --> 02:38:54.570
But I cannot see it.

02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:58.400
It is long since we had any hope.

02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:10.710
My father is a noble man.

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:13.710
But his rule is failing...

02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:19.470
and our people lose faith.

02:39:20.890 --> 02:39:24.390
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

02:39:24.600 --> 02:39:28.140
I would see the glory
of Gondor restored.

02:39:30.980 --> 02:39:33.980
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:36.610
The White Tower of Ecthelion.

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:40.650
Glimmering like a spike
of pearl and silver.

02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:44.830
Its banners caught high
in the morning breeze.

02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:49.670
Have you ever been called home...

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:53.790
by the clear ringing
of silver trumpets?

02:39:54.430 --> 02:39:57.680
I have seen the White City...

02:39:58.010 --> 02:39:59.510
long ago.

02:40:00.470 --> 02:40:05.430
One day, our paths will lead us there.

02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:09.310
And the tower guard
shall take up the call:

02:40:09.780 --> 02:40:13.110
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

02:41:20.310 --> 02:41:22.800
Will you look into the mirror?

02:41:23.020 --> 02:41:24.560
What will I see?

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:29.850
Even the wisest cannot tell.

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.600
For the mirror...

02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:35.360
shows many things.

02:41:38.370 --> 02:41:40.740
Things that were...

02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:43.530
things that are...

02:41:44.290 --> 02:41:46.250
and some things...

02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.170
that have not yet come to pass.

02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:18.560
I know what it is you saw.

02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:23.550
For it is also in my mind.

02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:29.400
It is what will come to pass
if you should fail.

02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:36.660
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

02:43:37.290 --> 02:43:40.570
He will try to take the Ring.

02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:42.780
You know of whom I speak.

02:43:43.790 --> 02:43:48.460
One by one, it will destroy them all.

02:43:49.970 --> 02:43:52.420
If you ask it of me...

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:55.890
I will give you the One Ring.

02:43:56.930 --> 02:43:59.090
You offer it to me freely?

02:44:03.690 --> 02:44:07.600
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

02:44:13.990 --> 02:44:17.280
In place of a Dark Lord,
you would have a queen...

02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:21.530
not dark but beautiful,
and terrible as the dawn!

02:44:22.170 --> 02:44:25.200
Treacherous as the sea!

02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:30.620
Stronger than the foundations
of the earth!

02:44:31.090 --> 02:44:33.470
All shall love me...

02:44:33.680 --> 02:44:36.520
and despair.

02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:54.940
I pass the test. I will diminish...

02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:57.660
and go into the West...

02:44:57.870 --> 02:45:02.340
- and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

02:45:05.970 --> 02:45:10.090
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...

02:45:11.010 --> 02:45:12.510
is to be alone.

02:45:15.850 --> 02:45:18.600
This is Nenya,
the Ring of Adamant.

02:45:18.810 --> 02:45:20.390
And I am its keeper.

02:45:23.610 --> 02:45:27.230
This task was appointed to you.

02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:31.150
And if you do not find a way...

02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:34.360
no one will.

02:45:34.750 --> 02:45:37.910
Then I know what I must do.

02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:39.780
It's just...

02:45:43.050 --> 02:45:45.290
I'm afraid to do it.

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:53.930
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

02:45:59.270 --> 02:46:05.030
Do you know how the Orcs
first came into being?

02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:09.110
They were Elves once.

02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:13.620
Taken by the Dark Powers...

02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:17.000
tortured and mutilated.

02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:22.620
A ruined and terrible form of life.

02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:24.750
And now...

02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:28.090
perfected.

02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:31.970
My fighting Uruk-hai...

02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:36.220
whom do you serve?

02:46:36.430 --> 02:46:38.930
Saruman!

02:46:59.790 --> 02:47:03.210
Hunt them down. Do not stop
until they are found.

02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:06.340
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:09.510
You will taste Man-flesh!

02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.230
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:22.650
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:25.730
Kill the others.

02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:50.380
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:55.300
May these cloaks help shield you
from unfriendly eyes.

02:48:02.530 --> 02:48:04.150
Lembas.

02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:05.990
Elvish waybread.

02:48:08.490 --> 02:48:11.490
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:19.870
How many did you eat?

02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:21.750
Four.

02:48:27.550 --> 02:48:30.130
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

02:48:30.350 --> 02:48:34.430
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore
of the Anduin.

02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:37.130
Nor will you find safety
on the western bank.

02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:41.140
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand
have been seen on our borders.

02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:46.440
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.700
You are being tracked.

02:48:59.130 --> 02:49:03.750
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.

02:49:21.070 --> 02:49:25.810
My gift for you, Legolas,
is a bow of the Galadhrim.

02:49:26.030 --> 02:49:29.530
Worthy of the skill
of our woodland kin.

02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:37.330
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:41.500
They have already seen service in war.

02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:43.960
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:47.460
You will find your courage.

02:49:49.350 --> 02:49:51.310
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:54.010
Elven rope made of hithlain.

02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:56.350
Thank you, my lady.

02:49:58.190 --> 02:50:01.530
Have you run out
of those nice, shiny daggers?

02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:10.950
And what gift would a dwarf ask
of the Elves?

02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.160
Nothing.

02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.250
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:23.090
for she is more fair
than all the jewels beneath the earth.

02:50:30.140 --> 02:50:31.690
Actually...

02:50:31.890 --> 02:50:33.520
There was one thing.

02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.980
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.

02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:39.980
Stupid to ask.

02:50:42.530 --> 02:50:44.610
I have nothing greater to give...

02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:48.410
than the gift you already bear.

02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:50.690
For her love,

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:57.340
l fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

02:50:58.130 --> 02:51:01.420
I would have her leave these shores,

02:51:02.970 --> 02:51:05.890
and be with her people.

02:51:07.890 --> 02:51:13.600
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.

02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:16.930
That choice is yet before her.

02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:20.560
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.

02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:26.690
To rise above the height of all
your fathers since the days of Elendil...

02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:31.240
or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:39.790
Farewell.

02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:47.050
There is much you have yet to do.

02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:54.810
We shall not meet again...

02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:56.400
Elessar.

02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:01.990
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:05.620
I give you the light of Earendil...

02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:08.700
our most beloved star.

02:52:17.840 --> 02:52:22.250
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

02:52:22.470 --> 02:52:26.600
when all other lights go out.

02:52:35.570 --> 02:52:38.730
I have taken my worst wound
at this parting...

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:43.660
having looked my last upon that
which is fairest.

02:52:44.410 --> 02:52:47.740
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.910
What was her gift?

02:52:50.130 --> 02:52:55.040
I asked her for one hair
from her golden head.

02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:58.710
She gave me three.

02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:44.330
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:51.170
I had hoped we would lose him
on the river.

02:54:51.420 --> 02:54:54.590
But he's too clever a waterman.

02:54:55.430 --> 02:54:58.680
And if he alerts the enemy
to our whereabouts...

02:54:58.890 --> 02:55:01.090
it will make the crossing
even more dangerous.

02:55:01.310 --> 02:55:03.350
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:06.600
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

02:55:06.810 --> 02:55:09.930
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

02:55:10.860 --> 02:55:13.860
- Mr. Frodo...
- I'm all right.

02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:15.270
But you're not.

02:55:15.570 --> 02:55:18.030
I'm here to help you.

02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:19.950
I promised Gandalf that I would.

02:55:25.920 --> 02:55:28.670
You can't help me, Sam.

02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:32.540
Not this time.

02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:37.550
Get some sleep.

02:55:43.770 --> 02:55:45.980
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:49.270
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:52.180
Strike out for Mordor from a place
of strength.

02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:55.310
There is no strength in Gondor
that can avail us.

02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:57.770
You were quick enough to trust
the Elves.

02:55:59.660 --> 02:56:02.450
Have you so little faith
in your own people?

02:56:02.660 --> 02:56:05.620
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:09.170
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in Men.

02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:11.580
But you will not see that.

02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:13.330
You are afraid!

02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:16.160
All your life, you have hidden
in the shadows.

02:56:16.430 --> 02:56:19.880
Scared of who you are,
of what you are.

02:56:22.310 --> 02:56:26.690
I will not lead the Ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

02:56:38.530 --> 02:56:39.860
Frodo.

02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:43.240
The Argonath.

02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:50.410
Long have I desired
to look upon the kings of old.

02:56:51.170 --> 02:56:53.080
My kin.

02:58:12.130 --> 02:58:14.340
We cross the lake at nightfall.

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:17.130
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

02:58:17.350 --> 02:58:20.800
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:24.930
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

02:58:25.150 --> 02:58:28.400
an impassable labyrinth
of razor-sharp rocks.

02:58:28.610 --> 02:58:31.690
And after that, it gets even better.

02:58:32.110 --> 02:58:36.990
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

02:58:37.200 --> 02:58:38.610
That is our road.

02:58:40.160 --> 02:58:43.330
I suggest you take some rest
and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

02:58:43.540 --> 02:58:45.280
Recover my...

02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:50.250
- We should leave now.
- No.

02:58:50.470 --> 02:58:54.880
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:58.550
It is not the eastern shore
that worries me.

02:58:58.770 --> 02:59:02.770
A shadow and a threat
has been growing in my mind.

02:59:03.270 --> 02:59:07.480
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

02:59:09.450 --> 02:59:14.400
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:16.620
Where's Frodo?

02:59:42.270 --> 02:59:44.180
None of us should wander alone.

02:59:45.570 --> 02:59:47.690
You, least of all.

02:59:47.900 --> 02:59:50.360
So much depends on you.

02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:52.400
Frodo?

03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:03.030
I know why you seek solitude.

03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:07.170
You suffer. I see it day by day.

03:00:07.970 --> 03:00:11.050
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

03:00:12.680 --> 03:00:15.350
There are other ways, Frodo.

03:00:15.560 --> 03:00:19.390
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:23.390
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

03:00:23.610 --> 03:00:26.690
Warning? Against what?

03:00:26.900 --> 03:00:29.020
We're all afraid, Frodo.

03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:32.860
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

03:00:33.080 --> 03:00:36.860
- don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

03:00:38.620 --> 03:00:41.950
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

03:00:43.540 --> 03:00:45.580
- If you would but lend me the Ring.
- No.

03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:50.500
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:55.640
What chance do you think you have?

03:00:55.850 --> 03:01:00.510
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.

03:01:00.730 --> 03:01:04.430
And you will beg for death
before the end!

03:01:06.570 --> 03:01:08.640
You fool!

03:01:08.860 --> 03:01:12.810
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:15.820
It should be mine! Give it to me!

03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:17.280
- Give it to me!
- No!

03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:19.320
- Give it to me!
- No.

03:01:26.970 --> 03:01:29.010
I see your mind.

03:01:29.220 --> 03:01:32.170
You will take the Ring to Sauron!

03:01:32.390 --> 03:01:34.260
You will betray us!

03:01:34.470 --> 03:01:37.680
You'll go to your death,
and the death of us all!

03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:41.770
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:50.360
Frodo?

03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:56.240
Frodo.

03:02:00.170 --> 03:02:02.210
What have I done?

03:02:02.420 --> 03:02:04.130
Please, Frodo.

03:02:04.340 --> 03:02:07.010
Frodo, I'm sorry!

03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:57.010
Frodo?

03:02:58.270 --> 03:03:01.360
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the Ring?

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:03.360
Stay away!

03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:05.350
Frodo!

03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:11.450
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

03:03:21.130 --> 03:03:23.620
Would you destroy it?

03:03:28.590 --> 03:03:30.550
Aragorn.

03:03:33.980 --> 03:03:36.300
Aragorn.

03:03:38.100 --> 03:03:39.980
Elessar.

03:03:47.620 --> 03:03:50.990
I would have gone with you to the end.

03:03:51.660 --> 03:03:54.500
Into the very fires of Mordor.

03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:59.000
I know.

03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:06.920
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:12.390
Go, Frodo!

03:04:15.390 --> 03:04:16.890
Run!

03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:18.810
Run!

03:04:43.380 --> 03:04:45.040
Mr. Frodo!

03:04:54.310 --> 03:04:56.100
Find the halfling!

03:04:57.730 --> 03:05:00.270
Find the halfling!

03:05:03.740 --> 03:05:05.400
Elendil!

03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:13.460
Aragorn, go!

03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:36.470
Frodo!

03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:38.690
Hide here. Quick!

03:05:39.320 --> 03:05:40.780
Come on!

03:05:43.240 --> 03:05:45.280
What's he doing?

03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:51.490
He's leaving.

03:05:56.290 --> 03:05:59.210
- No!
- Pippin!

03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:06.460
Run, Frodo. Go on!

03:06:07.010 --> 03:06:10.130
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

03:06:10.520 --> 03:06:12.140
- Over here!
- This way!

03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:25.310
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

03:07:20.670 --> 03:07:23.760
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

03:08:06.850 --> 03:08:07.960
Run!

03:11:39.580 --> 03:11:41.200
No.

03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:48.160
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

03:11:48.420 --> 03:11:50.460
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

03:11:52.340 --> 03:11:53.800
I let Frodo go.

03:11:54.460 --> 03:11:57.090
Then you did what I could not.

03:11:58.090 --> 03:12:01.380
I tried to take the Ring from him.

03:12:01.930 --> 03:12:06.180
- The Ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

03:12:06.390 --> 03:12:08.680
I did not see it.

03:12:08.900 --> 03:12:12.400
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

03:12:13.260 --> 03:12:14.830
You fought bravely.

03:12:15.660 --> 03:12:17.720
You have kept your honor.

03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:20.530
Leave it.

03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:22.950
It is over.

03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:29.370
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:32.840
and my city to ruin.

03:12:36.890 --> 03:12:39.590
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

03:12:39.810 --> 03:12:43.800
but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

03:12:44.810 --> 03:12:47.300
nor our people fail.

03:12:48.270 --> 03:12:49.650
Our people.

03:12:53.490 --> 03:12:55.560
Our people.

03:13:17.350 --> 03:13:20.350
I would have followed you, my brother.

03:13:21.890 --> 03:13:23.890
My captain.

03:13:26.520 --> 03:13:28.430
My king.

03:13:48.090 --> 03:13:50.330
Be at peace...

03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:52.710
son of Gondor.

03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:12.530
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:16.030
But he will not return.

03:14:39.270 --> 03:14:40.270
Frodo!

03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:03.990
I wish the Ring had never come to me.

03:15:05.250 --> 03:15:08.250
I wish none of this had happened.

03:15:11.220 --> 03:15:13.970
So do all who live
to see such times...

03:15:14.180 --> 03:15:17.630
but that is not for them to decide.

03:15:17.850 --> 03:15:20.470
All you have to decide...

03:15:20.690 --> 03:15:25.430
is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

03:15:54.260 --> 03:15:56.340
Frodo, no!

03:15:56.890 --> 03:15:58.170
Frodo!

03:15:58.980 --> 03:16:01.650
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:07.150
Go back, Sam!

03:16:07.650 --> 03:16:11.230
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

03:16:11.450 --> 03:16:14.280
And I'm coming with you!

03:16:14.780 --> 03:16:17.190
You can't swim!

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.710
Sam!

03:16:28.300 --> 03:16:29.630
Sam!

03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:13.260
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:17.930
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

03:17:19.060 --> 03:17:21.680
And I don't mean to.

03:17:21.940 --> 03:17:24.100
I don't mean to.

03:17:25.780 --> 03:17:26.780
Sam.

03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:44.160
Come on.

03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:17.160
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

03:18:32.050 --> 03:18:37.050
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:45.360
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

03:18:57.210 --> 03:19:00.370
Not if we hold true to each other.

03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:06.210
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

03:19:07.220 --> 03:19:12.460
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

03:19:13.770 --> 03:19:15.760
We travel light.

03:19:15.980 --> 03:19:17.890
Let us hunt some Orc.

03:19:20.860 --> 03:19:21.860
Yes!

03:19:41.880 --> 03:19:43.340
Mordor.

03:19:43.970 --> 03:19:47.330
I hope the others find a safer road.

03:19:48.260 --> 03:19:50.830
Strider will look after them.

03:19:51.760 --> 03:19:55.130
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

03:19:55.480 --> 03:19:57.880
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:59.680
We may.

03:20:01.730 --> 03:20:02.810
Sam...

03:20:06.410 --> 03:20:09.030
I'm glad you are with me.
