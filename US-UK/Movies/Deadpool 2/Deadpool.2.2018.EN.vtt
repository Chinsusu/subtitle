00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:16.054
<i>Fuck Wolverine.</i>

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.766
<i>First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.</i>

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.937
<i>Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.</i>

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:26.064
<i>What a dick.</i>

00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:28.358
<i>Well, guess what, Wolvie?</i>

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:30.735
<i>I'm dying in this one, too.</i>

00:02:34.405 --> 00:02:36.741
<i>To understand
why I took a cat-nap</i>

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:38.910
<i>on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...</i>

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:40.286
<i>I need to take you back</i>

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.705
<i>to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.</i>

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:44.082
<i>I'd gone international,</i>

00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.125
<i>taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,</i>

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.585
<i>unspeakable monsters.</i>

00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.672
<i>People nobody would touch.
Except me.</i>

00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:52.841
<i>I'm gonna touch them all over.</i>

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:58.429
<i>Hey, it's Gail calling.</i>

00:02:58.513 --> 00:02:59.597
<i>Love the shiny suit.</i>

00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.682
<i>Really brings out</i>

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:02.308
<i>the sex trafficker in your eyes.</i>

00:03:02.392 --> 00:03:04.561
Whatever they're paying,
I'll double it.

00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:07.772
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:10.817
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.528
But I did take
8th grade Spanish, so...

00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:15.697
Where is the library?

00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:17.824
Which literally translates to...

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:21.244
I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker.

00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.132
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

00:03:34.215 --> 00:03:35.425
I am so sorry.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:37.188
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.159
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.661
Although these will kill you.

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:04.746
Hit it, Dolly.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:26.643
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:40.490
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

00:04:47.997 --> 00:04:50.541
Whoo! Do not go in there!

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.342
Let's see
Captain America do that.

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.811
Too exotic?

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:33.501
I don't bargain.

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:34.896
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.483
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.318
Oh, that's so gross.

00:06:41.694 --> 00:06:42.737
Fuck.

00:06:43.905 --> 00:06:45.799
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

00:06:45.823 --> 00:06:46.866
I like it.

00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:53.623
Oh, man!

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.879
<i>My world tour brought me home</i>

00:06:59.962 --> 00:07:02.298
<i>to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov.</i>

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:03.925
<i>But we'll get to him
in a moment.</i>

00:07:04.008 --> 00:07:05.368
<i>'Cause I know
what you're thinking.</i>

00:07:05.426 --> 00:07:08.221
<i>"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."</i>

00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:09.584
<i>But that's where you'd be wrong.</i>

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.683
<i>That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...</i>

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:17.063
<i>and, believe it or not,</i>
Deadpool 2 <i>is a family film.</i>

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.189
<i>True story.</i>

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:22.151
<i>And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.</i>

00:07:22.235 --> 00:07:25.279
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:28.616
<i>Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.</i>

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:31.577
<i>That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.</i>

00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:34.997
<i>Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?</i>

00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:36.165
<i>But this guy?</i>

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.334
<i>He was one of the worst of 'em.</i>

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:42.505
<i>Hurry up and open
this fucking door,</i>

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:43.868
<i>and let's kill
this motherfucker!</i>

00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:52.431
<i>Ugh. So gross.</i>

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.268
<i>A panic room? Really?</i>

00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:57.937
Can you come out?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.107
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:08.322
<i>Over and over,
I hear people say,</i>

00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:09.886
<i>"I just don't have
enough confidence."</i>

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.118
<i>Listen, confidence is not
something you have.</i>

00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:13.452
<i>It's something you create.</i>

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:15.538
<i>And you can create it
at any moment in time.</i>

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:17.331
<i>A sense of confidence is nothing</i>

00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:18.767
<i>but a sense of power
within yourself...</i>

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:20.727
<i>a sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.</i>

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.795
Start the fucking car!

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:23.963
Dopinder!

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:25.590
Start the fucking car!

00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:32.597
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:34.307
Whoo!
Oh, I shit my pants.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.726
Actually, that may have been me.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.019
Oh, mission accomplished?

00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:40.188
Oh, in a George W.
Sort of way.

00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:41.939
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:43.441
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:45.651
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:46.944
and who'da thought?

00:08:47.028 --> 00:08:49.071
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:51.407
<i>Passion of the Christ,</i> then me.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.700
At least domestically.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:53.951
We beat them overseas,

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:55.995
where there's no such thing
as religion.

00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:58.247
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:00.625
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.501
I want to fill my...
Pockets?

00:09:02.585 --> 00:09:05.755
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:07.131
Can't maintain an erection

00:09:07.215 --> 00:09:08.633
without buying shoes online?

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.718
I've never experienced
that last one.

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.011
Talk to me, Goose.

00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.889
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:17.934
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.602
Dopinder...
Hmm?

00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:21.938
You never cease to surprise me.

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:26.067
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.777
We all need
a sense of belonging.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.612
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:30.780
A place in this world.

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:32.216
I want to become
a contract killer.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.741
I'm sorry. What did you say?

00:09:34.116 --> 00:09:36.035
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:37.471
and threatened him
with great violence?

00:09:37.495 --> 00:09:38.829
You kind of killed him.

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:40.724
And then remember the movie
<i>Interview with the Vampire?</i>

00:09:40.748 --> 00:09:41.874
Don't want to.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.000
When Tom Cruise fed

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:44.877
10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood

00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:46.128
for the first time...

00:09:46.212 --> 00:09:48.589
and she looked up at his smooth,

00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:50.883
handsome face and said...

00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:53.427
"I want some more."

00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:57.139
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

00:09:58.182 --> 00:10:00.184
I'll never not picture that.

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:02.687
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.146
as soon as possible.

00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:07.358
We're here.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:16.075
Dopinder, it's me again.

00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:17.827
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.745
from joining
the deadly merc business...

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:21.247
what, with your concave chest

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.957
and your paper towel tube arms.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.709
But you're an eagle...

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:26.752
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

00:10:26.836 --> 00:10:28.170
You gotta grab those dreams,

00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:29.839
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:31.424
and make it rain!

00:10:31.507 --> 00:10:33.384
I don't know what that means.

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.428
Me neither.

00:10:36.012 --> 00:10:37.471
I'm gonna see you...

00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:40.141
at the office.

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:41.809
In the sky.

00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:42.935
You're my Tom Cruise!

00:10:43.019 --> 00:10:44.645
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

00:10:44.729 --> 00:10:45.980
Kristen? Kirsten?

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:52.820
Sorry I'm late.

00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:54.447
There was a bunch of

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.574
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:57.908
and I had to, uh...
Uh-uh.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.911
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:03.247
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:05.333
No.
You got me.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.510
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:08.785
and launching it into space...

00:11:08.836 --> 00:11:10.838
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

00:11:11.005 --> 00:11:12.173
Try again.

00:11:12.757 --> 00:11:14.175
Diarrhea?

00:11:14.342 --> 00:11:16.102
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:19.013
but, uh, all signs point to yes.

00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:21.932
Traffic?

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:23.601
Hmm?

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.395
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:27.480
Well, come here.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.951
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:42.862
Don't you want your surprise?

00:11:42.912 --> 00:11:44.747
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:46.791
I got one for you, too.

00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:49.293
Happy anniversary, baby.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.045
Open, open, open.

00:11:53.047 --> 00:11:54.382
Skee-Ball token.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.175
Our first date.

00:11:56.258 --> 00:11:57.510
Yup.

00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:00.554
That's genuine, high-grade lead.

00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:05.351
I'll keep it forever.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.228
Thank you, baby.

00:12:08.854 --> 00:12:10.564
Open yours.
All right, all right.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.775
Oh...

00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.046
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.405
I don't know what this is.

00:12:17.488 --> 00:12:18.989
My IUD.

00:12:19.365 --> 00:12:20.366
A bomb?

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:23.244
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:24.824
What, you mean that your...

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.580
Baby factory's open
for business.

00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:27.748
Oh, my God!

00:12:27.998 --> 00:12:31.210
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:34.130
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

00:12:34.422 --> 00:12:37.216
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.344
Like Cher or Todd.

00:12:41.095 --> 00:12:42.847
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.931
Yes, I do.

00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.826
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.851
Let's do that.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.520
<i>Papa...</i>

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.398
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

00:12:53.858 --> 00:12:56.193
<i>Papa, can you see me?</i>

00:12:56.527 --> 00:12:58.779
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

00:13:01.073 --> 00:13:02.533
May.

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:06.996
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:12.042
So weird.

00:13:12.126 --> 00:13:14.545
Family was always
an F-word to me.

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:19.258
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:22.636
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.430
to draw off of for Todd.

00:13:25.598 --> 00:13:28.225
Hey. Look at me.

00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.562
You are not your father.

00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:34.690
Besides...

00:13:34.773 --> 00:13:39.487
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:41.489
But here's the thing,

00:13:41.572 --> 00:13:43.115
isn't that how it always works?

00:13:43.449 --> 00:13:44.950
Like in <i>Star Wars,</i>

00:13:45.034 --> 00:13:47.077
men are destined
to become their father...

00:13:47.786 --> 00:13:50.831
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

00:13:50.915 --> 00:13:53.334
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:56.462
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:58.172
Baby, that's <i>Empire.</i>

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:01.258
The point is, kids...

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.387
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

00:14:06.222 --> 00:14:08.349
Better than we used to be.

00:14:08.933 --> 00:14:11.435
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

00:14:12.478 --> 00:14:13.854
I'm gonna go make dessert.

00:14:14.188 --> 00:14:17.316
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.945
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.574
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:27.576
It's too stripper-y.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.161
Kevin with a "K"!

00:14:29.245 --> 00:14:31.330
No, too stripper-y, too.

00:14:31.914 --> 00:14:33.499
Uh, Earl!

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:36.168
He's gonna go straight to jail

00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:38.045
if we name him Earl.

00:14:38.504 --> 00:14:40.381
What about Bruce?

00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:42.550
No.

00:14:42.883 --> 00:14:43.884
Get down.

00:14:43.968 --> 00:14:45.344
What?

00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:16.000
Baby? Baby?

00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:20.671
I'm okay.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:23.841
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

00:15:58.584 --> 00:15:59.877
Please.

00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:06.759
Please. Please.

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.887
Baby, I'm so sorry.

00:16:10.054 --> 00:16:13.849
No!

00:19:18.367 --> 00:19:21.078
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:23.539
Is it just me, or does

00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:25.422
<i>Do You Want to Build
a Snowman?</i> from <i>Frozen...</i>

00:19:25.457 --> 00:19:26.708
sound suspiciously like

00:19:26.792 --> 00:19:28.710
<i>Papa, Can You Hear Me?</i>
From <i>Yentl?</i>

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:32.256
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.593
And nobody fucking realizes it.

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:38.220
Wade, you gotta go home.

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.889
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:44.643
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.104
Like wet garbage in hot urine.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.314
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

00:19:49.398 --> 00:19:51.400
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:53.277
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.903
couch cushions after <i>Shark Week.</i>

00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:56.613
I love <i>Frozen.</i>

00:19:56.989 --> 00:20:00.200
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:01.702
An ocean is water.

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:06.456
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:08.083
George Michael was right.

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:10.002
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

00:20:10.586 --> 00:20:11.587
He's dead, too.

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:14.089
At least we still have Bowie.

00:20:14.172 --> 00:20:15.841
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:16.925
Uh, uh, uh...

00:20:17.259 --> 00:20:18.385
still with us.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:21.346
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.931
I'm sorry.

00:20:23.056 --> 00:20:24.308
Shot after shot,

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.369
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:28.037
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:30.814
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:32.441
Is he pissing?
I'm on it!

00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:34.067
There you go, Dopinder.

00:20:34.151 --> 00:20:36.153
If you want to be
a contract killer...

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.739
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:39.883
Although I don't
quite understand

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.116
how they are at all similar.

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:43.577
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.745
Now, leave me.

00:20:44.828 --> 00:20:45.829
I get it.

00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:47.915
Go home, Wade.

00:20:47.998 --> 00:20:50.375
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:53.170
Okay, I'm fine.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.254
I'm fine.

00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:56.214
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:59.635
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

00:21:00.052 --> 00:21:01.303
According to the...

00:21:02.638 --> 00:21:03.805
Kübler-Ross.
Yeah.

00:21:04.139 --> 00:21:05.933
According to
the Kübler-Ross model...

00:21:06.016 --> 00:21:08.769
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.812
Jesus Christ, Buck!

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.190
No more speaking lines for you.

00:21:21.823 --> 00:21:24.159
<i>Hey, bud. Bud.</i>

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:26.036
<i>- Huh?
- Got a match?</i>

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.371
<i>Match?</i>

00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:29.247
<i>Yes, I have one right here.</i>

00:21:29.331 --> 00:21:30.808
<i>Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.</i>

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.542
<i>- What?
- You heard me.</i>

00:21:32.626 --> 00:21:34.628
<i>Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.</i>

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.297
<i>Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?</i>

00:21:45.514 --> 00:21:49.142
<i>Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."</i>

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:50.310
"I'm thinking it over!"

00:21:50.644 --> 00:21:51.979
Motherfuck!

00:21:52.062 --> 00:21:53.146
Fuck!

00:21:56.108 --> 00:21:57.567
The hell you doin' here?

00:21:57.651 --> 00:21:59.069
Don't you know how to knock?

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:01.655
I thought you saw me...

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.073
with your ears.

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.384
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:05.409
The wall?

00:22:05.492 --> 00:22:08.870
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

00:22:11.665 --> 00:22:13.250
I heard the news, sweetie.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.085
I'm very sorry. I am.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.920
What am I gonna do, Al?

00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:19.131
Probably something terrible.

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:21.550
Knowing you.

00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:23.260
It was my fault.

00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.346
I fucking did this.

00:22:27.222 --> 00:22:29.016
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.101
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:34.688
She's gone.

00:22:34.771 --> 00:22:38.191
Sweetheart, can you speak up?

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:39.818
It's a little hard to hear you

00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:41.570
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

00:22:41.653 --> 00:22:44.656
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.741
Thank you...

00:22:45.824 --> 00:22:49.036
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:51.163
Listen to the pain.

00:22:51.246 --> 00:22:53.957
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.918
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

00:22:57.711 --> 00:23:00.964
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:04.342
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

00:23:06.845 --> 00:23:08.055
Wade?

00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:12.434
Wade?
I'm right here, Althea.

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:15.312
And that is
the most beautiful thing

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.605
I've ever heard.

00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:18.899
And you're absolutely right.

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:25.113
I'm about to do
something terrible.

00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.454
Precious, aren't they?

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:34.664
Whoa!

00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:36.166
Are you a superhero?

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:37.876
Fucking A, sweetie.

00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.503
What's your name?

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.338
Captain Delicious Pants.

00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.590
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:10.909
I can't believe
he's still alive.

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:13.495
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

00:24:14.955 --> 00:24:16.873
There's gotta be
some way to die.

00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:18.959
I just need to die harder.

00:24:19.042 --> 00:24:20.168
Trademark Fox.

00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:21.336
Y'all caught up now?

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:36.184
<i>Open for business.</i>

00:24:40.105 --> 00:24:41.857
<i>Your crazy matches my crazy.</i>

00:24:42.274 --> 00:24:44.317
<i>I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.</i>

00:24:44.484 --> 00:24:45.569
<i>Skee-Ball token.</i>

00:24:45.652 --> 00:24:46.932
<i>You're a lot smarter
than I look.</i>

00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:54.053
<i>About why
we're so good together.</i>

00:24:54.077 --> 00:24:55.412
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

00:24:58.081 --> 00:24:59.499
Ness?

00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:02.085
Ness?

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:03.920
Ness.

00:25:04.546 --> 00:25:07.215
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:11.011
Your heart's not
in the right place.

00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.346
Wait, hold on. What?

00:25:14.181 --> 00:25:16.266
Your heart's not
in the right place.

00:25:16.349 --> 00:25:17.392
Wait. What do you mean

00:25:17.475 --> 00:25:19.435
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

00:25:38.955 --> 00:25:41.499
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

00:25:41.958 --> 00:25:43.043
You're broken.

00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:46.087
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:08.568
Well, Russell.

00:26:08.652 --> 00:26:11.321
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

00:26:12.697 --> 00:26:14.866
There will be no need
for that here.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.245
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.623
I know what you're thinking.

00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:23.792
Why don't the kids just run?

00:26:24.417 --> 00:26:26.962
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

00:26:27.379 --> 00:26:29.422
You stay because...

00:26:29.923 --> 00:26:34.636
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

00:26:38.473 --> 00:26:40.058
Don't worry.

00:26:41.226 --> 00:26:42.894
We can fix that.

00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:51.486
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

00:27:13.466 --> 00:27:15.093
"Heart's in the right place."

00:27:15.176 --> 00:27:16.654
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.555
Take your mask off, Wade.

00:27:18.638 --> 00:27:20.223
I wish you'd said "pants".

00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:21.558
Let's play a game.

00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:24.102
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.521
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.440
You don't need to be funny here.

00:27:29.024 --> 00:27:30.191
We must talk.

00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:32.777
You need fresh start.

00:27:32.861 --> 00:27:34.362
Such a glare.

00:27:34.446 --> 00:27:36.614
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:39.242
With training, you can be X-Man.

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:41.494
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:42.829
I'm not X-Man material.

00:27:42.912 --> 00:27:44.497
Understatement of the year.

00:27:44.956 --> 00:27:45.957
Wade, Yukio.

00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:47.584
Yukio, Wade.

00:27:48.376 --> 00:27:50.462
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

00:27:50.545 --> 00:27:52.422
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

00:27:53.214 --> 00:27:55.008
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
<i>Fox & Friends.</i>

00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.926
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.304
Especially Pinkie Pie
from <i>My Little Pony.</i>

00:27:59.679 --> 00:28:01.014
I like this guy.

00:28:01.556 --> 00:28:02.849
Give him a chance.

00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:04.785
It's great seeing you like this.

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:06.978
Yeah.

00:28:07.437 --> 00:28:08.438
Bye, Wade!

00:28:08.813 --> 00:28:11.232
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

00:28:11.316 --> 00:28:14.069
"Rule number one.
No killing...

00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:17.572
"anyone ever, no matter how bad.

00:28:17.655 --> 00:28:20.241
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:21.326
Wade?

00:28:22.202 --> 00:28:23.286
Wade?

00:28:23.495 --> 00:28:25.246
Don't try to chase me.
Wade!

00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:27.415
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

00:28:27.499 --> 00:28:29.709
All these old guys on the wall.

00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:31.878
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

00:28:34.089 --> 00:28:36.466
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:38.968
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:41.262
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

00:28:41.346 --> 00:28:43.932
And how would I do that exactly?

00:28:44.265 --> 00:28:46.684
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

00:28:46.768 --> 00:28:47.852
It's always just you

00:28:47.936 --> 00:28:49.330
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:50.355
Enough!

00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:52.482
I said no touching!

00:28:54.234 --> 00:28:56.778
What the fuck?

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.697
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:01.825
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

00:29:02.659 --> 00:29:03.844
The first movie made more money

00:29:03.868 --> 00:29:06.162
than the guy who invented pants.

00:29:06.246 --> 00:29:08.373
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:10.542
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

00:29:10.625 --> 00:29:11.876
What do those do anyway, huh?

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.378
Carry him
three feet off the ground

00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:15.380
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

00:29:15.588 --> 00:29:17.715
No, no, no!

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:20.468
I am not X-Man material at all.

00:29:20.552 --> 00:29:23.179
First off...

00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:25.306
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:28.560
I should have left you

00:29:28.643 --> 00:29:30.311
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

00:29:30.395 --> 00:29:33.440
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

00:29:33.523 --> 00:29:35.191
Not when convenient or easy.

00:29:35.567 --> 00:29:38.945
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

00:29:39.946 --> 00:29:42.365
You are unwell.

00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:44.534
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:46.453
Wait.
One of the assholes

00:29:46.536 --> 00:29:48.037
who killed Vanessa got away.

00:29:50.623 --> 00:29:52.625
Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:54.728
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

00:29:54.752 --> 00:29:56.689
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.715
Wade, whoever they are...

00:29:58.798 --> 00:30:01.134
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:03.136
It was me.

00:30:05.972 --> 00:30:07.557
I'm the asshole who got away.

00:30:08.683 --> 00:30:11.311
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

00:30:11.853 --> 00:30:13.563
Couldn't kill me.

00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:18.693
We were gonna start a family.

00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:22.405
We were, uh...

00:30:23.698 --> 00:30:25.408
We were gonna be a family.

00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:27.202
Wade...

00:30:27.368 --> 00:30:30.163
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

00:30:31.748 --> 00:30:34.042
This may not be
family you want...

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:36.127
but it's family you need.

00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:37.837
You have a good heart.

00:30:37.921 --> 00:30:39.464
It belongs here
where it can grow.

00:30:41.257 --> 00:30:42.258
What did you say?

00:30:44.302 --> 00:30:45.637
About my heart?

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:53.061
I think I'm in the right place.

00:32:00.878 --> 00:32:03.631
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:05.300
Toilet paper.

00:32:05.383 --> 00:32:06.759
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

00:32:06.843 --> 00:32:08.011
Gets the job done.

00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:10.930
Does it really get the job done?

00:32:11.014 --> 00:32:13.182
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

00:32:13.266 --> 00:32:17.937
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

00:32:18.021 --> 00:32:19.741
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

00:32:19.772 --> 00:32:21.458
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

00:32:21.482 --> 00:32:22.525
What do you do?

00:32:22.609 --> 00:32:23.901
Do you go to a bathroom

00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:25.612
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

00:32:25.695 --> 00:32:27.530
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

00:32:27.614 --> 00:32:29.157
and then go on,
get on with your day?

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.825
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

00:32:30.908 --> 00:32:31.993
like nothing happened?

00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:33.411
Where is this coming from, man?

00:32:33.494 --> 00:32:34.704
But something did happen.

00:32:34.787 --> 00:32:36.205
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:37.832
So what you would do,

00:32:37.915 --> 00:32:40.126
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

00:32:40.209 --> 00:32:42.503
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

00:32:42.587 --> 00:32:44.547
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.299
You could not scrub it enough.

00:32:46.382 --> 00:32:48.022
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

00:32:48.092 --> 00:32:49.260
I'm starting to feel...

00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:52.013
Toilet paper is
a plenty fine appetizer.

00:32:52.096 --> 00:32:54.182
But, then...

00:32:54.432 --> 00:32:56.726
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes.

00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.144
That's your main course.

00:32:58.227 --> 00:33:01.356
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.942
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

00:33:05.026 --> 00:33:06.903
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

00:33:06.986 --> 00:33:08.571
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:09.947
if you can get you a hair dryer.

00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:12.367
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:17.080
The fuck?

00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:19.374
Year.

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:21.376
What?

00:33:22.585 --> 00:33:24.212
What year is it?

00:33:24.295 --> 00:33:26.756
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

00:33:57.495 --> 00:34:00.248
<i>We have 8 weeks
of boot camp ahead of us, men.</i>

00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:01.624
<i>That'll get us
toned and prepared</i>

00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:03.292
<i>for all manner of combat.</i>

00:34:05.378 --> 00:34:09.382
Not working out at all.

00:34:09.632 --> 00:34:11.259
Masking tape.

00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:13.678
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

00:34:14.762 --> 00:34:16.723
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

00:34:16.806 --> 00:34:17.890
environmentally friendly.

00:34:18.641 --> 00:34:20.184
Who is he talking to?

00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:21.954
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

00:34:21.978 --> 00:34:23.938
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:26.274
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

00:34:26.357 --> 00:34:28.109
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

00:34:28.192 --> 00:34:29.485
I read the suggestion box.

00:34:29.569 --> 00:34:31.154
I'm gonna stop you right there.

00:34:31.237 --> 00:34:33.030
I see through this weak act.

00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:37.493
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.828
but not me.

00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:39.954
Don't be mean.

00:34:40.037 --> 00:34:41.330
Back off, NTW.

00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.583
No, no, no. Let her go.

00:34:43.666 --> 00:34:44.792
Let her go, it's okay.

00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:46.419
She has a right to be skeptical.

00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:49.130
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

00:34:50.298 --> 00:34:51.632
You know, historically,

00:34:51.716 --> 00:34:53.593
mischief has been my mistress...

00:34:53.676 --> 00:34:56.345
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

00:34:57.972 --> 00:34:59.932
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:03.389
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

00:35:05.354 --> 00:35:06.355
A lot.

00:35:07.356 --> 00:35:09.984
And for the first time
in a long while...

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:11.235
I like me.

00:35:13.446 --> 00:35:15.948
I accept your apology.
I never apologized.

00:35:16.032 --> 00:35:17.533
I was talking to your heart.

00:35:17.617 --> 00:35:19.994
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:23.247
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:24.624
Thank you, Colossus.

00:35:25.374 --> 00:35:26.974
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

00:35:27.043 --> 00:35:28.461
Sorry, X-Person.

00:35:30.046 --> 00:35:32.673
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

00:35:32.757 --> 00:35:34.342
It's fine.

00:35:34.425 --> 00:35:36.636
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:40.306
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:35:40.389 --> 00:35:42.141
it's dust bunny season...

00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:43.226
and I'm hunting wabbits.

00:35:43.935 --> 00:35:45.061
Bye, Wade!

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.774
Fuck.
Fuck you.

00:36:01.452 --> 00:36:03.996
<i>No one is born perfect.</i>

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.040
But you can be.

00:36:06.123 --> 00:36:08.459
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

00:36:12.755 --> 00:36:14.590
You can't help yourself.

00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:19.929
But you can.

00:36:20.596 --> 00:36:23.266
It takes work, discipline...

00:36:23.724 --> 00:36:24.934
and treatment.

00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:26.686
Your abilities...

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:30.648
I know how seductive they are.

00:36:31.482 --> 00:36:33.651
How powerful they make you feel.

00:36:34.652 --> 00:36:37.154
But you must learn
never to use them...

00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:39.824
so they will never use you.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.665
Please don't cry.

00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:50.084
I'm going to help.

00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:53.004
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

00:36:53.379 --> 00:36:54.797
How you need to feel...

00:36:55.923 --> 00:36:58.467
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

00:36:59.343 --> 00:37:03.264
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:18.946
<i>Wade.</i>

00:37:19.864 --> 00:37:20.865
Wade!

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.534
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:25.161
a little bit
of light reading here...

00:37:25.578 --> 00:37:26.913
We have mission.

00:37:27.038 --> 00:37:28.539
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

00:37:28.623 --> 00:37:29.832
I'll be praying for you.

00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:32.335
No, I want you to join.

00:37:33.544 --> 00:37:34.670
I'm sorry, what?

00:37:34.754 --> 00:37:36.339
You heard me.

00:37:36.422 --> 00:37:38.674
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

00:37:38.841 --> 00:37:39.884
I'm really not ready.

00:37:39.967 --> 00:37:41.469
You are ready.
I'm not.

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:43.471
Be at the X-Jet in five.

00:37:43.638 --> 00:37:44.764
I can do thirty.

00:37:44.847 --> 00:37:46.766
Now.
I can do now.

00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:47.892
Final offer.

00:37:48.142 --> 00:37:50.645
<i>Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.</i>

00:37:50.728 --> 00:37:52.688
<i>Live here
at a breaking news situation</i>

00:37:52.772 --> 00:37:55.399
<i>at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.</i>

00:37:55.483 --> 00:37:57.401
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

00:37:57.485 --> 00:37:58.694
some sort of an incident...

00:37:58.778 --> 00:38:00.505
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:02.907
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.468
There are open fires.
Fuck off! Stay back!

00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:05.552
A scene of absolute chaos here.

00:38:05.576 --> 00:38:06.577
Calm down.

00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.372
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:11.832
Get away from me!

00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:14.418
You wanna fucking die?

00:38:29.433 --> 00:38:32.603
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:33.688
Scatter!

00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:36.232
With what appears
to be a trainee.

00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:39.276
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.444
We're the X-Men!

00:38:40.528 --> 00:38:42.738
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

00:38:43.155 --> 00:38:45.324
So, respect.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.951
At ease, Officer.

00:38:48.536 --> 00:38:50.079
What are you doing?

00:38:50.538 --> 00:38:51.789
My job!

00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:53.272
You're the one who said
I was ready,

00:38:53.332 --> 00:38:54.792
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:57.253
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

00:38:57.336 --> 00:38:59.755
Like Beyoncé says, "Please...

00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:01.924
"Please, stop cheating on me."

00:39:02.008 --> 00:39:03.092
Hey!

00:39:03.175 --> 00:39:04.510
This is the fifth incident.

00:39:04.593 --> 00:39:06.762
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

00:39:06.846 --> 00:39:08.472
Russell belongs in our care.

00:39:08.556 --> 00:39:10.307
Not in prison.
I assure you...

00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:11.535
we have everything
under control.

00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:12.601
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

00:39:12.685 --> 00:39:13.853
Not getting a real

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:15.604
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

00:39:16.063 --> 00:39:18.065
It is Glen, isn't it?
Daniel.

00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:19.389
I'll ask the questions, Miguel.

00:39:19.442 --> 00:39:20.735
Let me talk to the kid.

00:39:20.818 --> 00:39:25.656
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

00:39:27.408 --> 00:39:28.409
You wanna die?

00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:29.493
This kid's adorable.

00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:30.721
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

00:39:30.745 --> 00:39:31.871
I'll burn your balls off!

00:39:31.954 --> 00:39:34.582
First day.
I'm so nervous!

00:39:35.374 --> 00:39:36.876
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:38.294
Yeah, probably should've

00:39:38.377 --> 00:39:40.421
brought a Super Soaker.

00:39:40.963 --> 00:39:41.964
Hi, there!

00:39:43.257 --> 00:39:45.718
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies!

00:39:45.801 --> 00:39:49.305
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

00:39:50.681 --> 00:39:52.308
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:55.478
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.021
Okay? Let's just talk!

00:39:57.104 --> 00:39:58.355
It's Russell, right?

00:39:58.773 --> 00:40:00.608
Firefist.
Firefist.

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:03.277
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.160
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:12.453
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

00:40:12.536 --> 00:40:14.538
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

00:40:15.414 --> 00:40:17.750
You stole that from <i>Robocop!</i>
That's from <i>Robocop!</i>

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.835
Just stand down!

00:40:19.919 --> 00:40:21.962
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire...

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.674
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

00:40:30.429 --> 00:40:33.974
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:35.810
Put your hands behind your knees

00:40:35.893 --> 00:40:37.353
and get down
on your head! Now!

00:40:37.436 --> 00:40:39.647
Wade! What was first rule?

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.649
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

00:40:41.732 --> 00:40:44.318
Do not escalate!
Rules are meant to be broken!

00:40:44.401 --> 00:40:45.778
That's the exact opposite

00:40:45.861 --> 00:40:47.238
of what they're meant for!

00:40:48.239 --> 00:40:49.698
Fuck! Fine!

00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:51.441
I'll start from the beginning.

00:40:51.909 --> 00:40:54.245
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

00:40:54.328 --> 00:40:56.288
Trainee!
Shut it!

00:40:57.206 --> 00:40:59.500
Look, I get it.

00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:02.294
All right, you're scared.

00:41:02.837 --> 00:41:03.879
Alone.

00:41:03.963 --> 00:41:05.005
You got no family.

00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:06.149
I didn't have a family, either.

00:41:06.173 --> 00:41:07.883
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:09.677
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

00:41:10.594 --> 00:41:11.887
But you know something?

00:41:11.971 --> 00:41:13.681
A wise woman once said to me...

00:41:13.764 --> 00:41:15.141
"Speak up.

00:41:15.224 --> 00:41:17.434
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:19.728
Too much? I went too far.

00:41:27.736 --> 00:41:29.238
That was effervescent.

00:41:29.321 --> 00:41:31.240
Stay in school, kid.

00:41:31.615 --> 00:41:33.117
Or don't. I didn't.

00:41:33.492 --> 00:41:35.035
And I'm an X-Man.

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:36.203
Trainee.

00:41:36.287 --> 00:41:37.621
Fuck it!

00:41:37.705 --> 00:41:39.456
Superhero landing coming up!

00:41:43.043 --> 00:41:44.670
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:46.589
That is so not practical.

00:42:07.359 --> 00:42:09.361
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

00:42:09.445 --> 00:42:10.446
Trainee!

00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:11.572
Trainee!

00:42:12.198 --> 00:42:13.699
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:16.994
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:20.372
What's that do?

00:42:20.456 --> 00:42:21.916
Power-dampening collar.

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:23.279
Shuts down all mutant abilities.

00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:26.128
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

00:42:26.212 --> 00:42:29.173
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:30.507
Thank you!

00:42:32.343 --> 00:42:34.553
That was absolutely thrilling.

00:42:34.637 --> 00:42:36.639
True heroism in action.

00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.557
We are in your debt.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.976
We can take it from here.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.229
Take me to the Ice Box, please!

00:42:43.312 --> 00:42:44.480
Anywhere's better than here.

00:42:44.563 --> 00:42:45.773
Believe me, son,

00:42:45.856 --> 00:42:47.566
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.152
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

00:42:50.277 --> 00:42:52.112
Let's get you inside, young man.

00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:54.156
No, wait, wait. Wait.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.741
You guys stay there.

00:43:05.834 --> 00:43:07.461
Those guys hurt you?

00:43:08.879 --> 00:43:09.922
Who?

00:43:11.966 --> 00:43:14.677
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

00:43:16.136 --> 00:43:17.638
Both of 'em?

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.018
Oh, fuck it.

00:43:23.102 --> 00:43:24.645
Four or five moments!

00:43:24.728 --> 00:43:25.729
I'm sorry?

00:43:25.813 --> 00:43:28.983
Four or five moments!

00:43:30.234 --> 00:43:32.987
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

00:43:34.029 --> 00:43:36.031
People think
you wake up a hero...

00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:37.992
brush your teeth a hero...

00:43:38.575 --> 00:43:41.078
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:46.625
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.586
A few moments...

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.298
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

00:43:55.843 --> 00:43:56.969
No!

00:43:59.638 --> 00:44:00.848
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

00:44:00.931 --> 00:44:03.225
Wade, what did you do?
Colossus, no!

00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:06.562
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

00:44:06.645 --> 00:44:08.897
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

00:44:08.981 --> 00:44:10.441
What was your first clue?

00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:13.319
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

00:44:13.694 --> 00:44:14.945
That kid was abused!

00:44:15.029 --> 00:44:16.822
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

00:44:17.114 --> 00:44:19.825
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

00:44:19.908 --> 00:44:22.828
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

00:44:22.911 --> 00:44:24.496
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:27.833
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

00:44:30.961 --> 00:44:33.213
Okay, get these guys in the pod.

00:44:33.297 --> 00:44:35.466
Take them to the Ice Box.

00:44:56.111 --> 00:44:57.112
Hey, baby!

00:44:58.197 --> 00:45:00.407
I wonder what gang I'll be in.

00:45:00.491 --> 00:45:01.867
Yeah!

00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:04.286
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

00:45:06.163 --> 00:45:07.539
I've always seen myself as

00:45:07.623 --> 00:45:08.999
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:13.462
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:17.383
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:20.677
I love the decor though.

00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:22.679
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

00:45:22.763 --> 00:45:24.014
Hard left, douchebag.

00:45:28.519 --> 00:45:29.686
Please, after you.

00:45:31.897 --> 00:45:34.566
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:35.734
We'll sleep well tonight.

00:45:35.818 --> 00:45:36.819
Let's get a bagel.

00:45:40.114 --> 00:45:42.950
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

00:46:18.735 --> 00:46:20.571
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

00:46:20.654 --> 00:46:23.031
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

00:46:23.115 --> 00:46:25.576
Not to worry, we're old friends.

00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:26.827
Fuck!

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.579
I wanted to be a superhero.

00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:31.039
Always wanted a real super suit.

00:46:31.123 --> 00:46:32.666
What happened?

00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:34.869
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

00:46:35.502 --> 00:46:36.670
Never.

00:46:37.045 --> 00:46:38.839
The industry discriminates.

00:46:39.923 --> 00:46:41.467
Fuck superheroes.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.261
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:46.180
I never stood up
for myself in there.

00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:49.600
My whole life.

00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:54.229
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

00:46:56.648 --> 00:46:59.610
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:05.991
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

00:47:07.326 --> 00:47:09.161
I have a mission now.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.748
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

00:47:12.831 --> 00:47:15.125
burn the headmaster alive...

00:47:15.209 --> 00:47:17.794
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

00:47:18.962 --> 00:47:21.381
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:25.052
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:27.137
but what did he do to you?

00:47:27.763 --> 00:47:29.306
Did he taste the rainbow?

00:47:29.389 --> 00:47:31.433
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:34.228
Fucker hates mutants.

00:47:34.686 --> 00:47:36.563
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

00:47:36.647 --> 00:47:39.191
Nothing worse than a
"pray the gay away" type guy.

00:47:39.983 --> 00:47:41.360
Sick piece of shit.

00:47:42.778 --> 00:47:46.448
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

00:47:47.407 --> 00:47:49.076
and we'll make him our bitch!

00:47:53.038 --> 00:47:54.331
What was that?

00:47:54.414 --> 00:47:56.375
That is the biggest guy in here.

00:47:57.042 --> 00:47:59.086
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

00:47:59.169 --> 00:48:00.963
though no one's ever seen it,

00:48:01.046 --> 00:48:03.215
they keep a monster
in the basement.

00:48:03.298 --> 00:48:05.008
Right next to a huge,

00:48:05.092 --> 00:48:06.635
steaming bowl of foreshadowing.

00:48:07.261 --> 00:48:08.262
Look.

00:48:09.263 --> 00:48:11.181
I can't protect you.

00:48:11.557 --> 00:48:12.683
With this collar on,

00:48:12.766 --> 00:48:15.852
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

00:48:15.936 --> 00:48:18.814
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

00:48:19.439 --> 00:48:21.483
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:48:21.567 --> 00:48:24.736
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.072
I'll start by making us a shank.

00:48:27.322 --> 00:48:29.199
Good listening.
I stole that guard's pen...

00:48:29.283 --> 00:48:31.201
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

00:48:31.285 --> 00:48:32.661
if you know what I'm saying.

00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:35.205
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

00:48:37.291 --> 00:48:39.585
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

00:48:39.668 --> 00:48:41.587
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:48:41.837 --> 00:48:44.089
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

00:48:44.506 --> 00:48:46.633
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.764
<i>And to update you</i>

00:48:52.848 --> 00:48:54.182
<i>on the story reported earlier,</i>

00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:55.809
<i>after a lengthy standoff</i>

00:48:55.892 --> 00:48:58.562
<i>outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...</i>

00:48:58.645 --> 00:48:59.938
<i>two mutants were arrested</i>

00:49:00.022 --> 00:49:01.648
<i>and transported
to the Ice Box...</i>

00:49:01.815 --> 00:49:03.191
<i>Entering repair mode.</i>

00:49:07.613 --> 00:49:09.048
<i>Several
police cars were destroyed</i>

00:49:09.072 --> 00:49:11.074
<i>and the X-Men were called in
to restore order.</i>

00:49:32.304 --> 00:49:34.264
<i>Cells seven and nine</i>

00:49:34.348 --> 00:49:37.684
<i>now off-limits
for medical personnel.</i>

00:49:37.768 --> 00:49:39.227
<i>Cells seven and nine</i>

00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:42.064
<i>now off-limits
for medical personnel.</i>

00:49:43.815 --> 00:49:45.192
Psst!

00:49:47.486 --> 00:49:49.321
Don't do that.

00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:52.741
What? Why are you
winking at me?

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.746
I got your back.

00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:58.997
Oh, my God.

00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:00.540
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

00:50:00.624 --> 00:50:02.542
Just leave me alone, kid.

00:50:03.669 --> 00:50:04.753
Oh, great.

00:50:06.588 --> 00:50:09.091
Well, hello there, new fish.

00:50:09.174 --> 00:50:12.094
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.471
I've done some
light catalog work...

00:50:14.554 --> 00:50:17.015
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

00:50:17.099 --> 00:50:19.017
I was talking to him.
Oh.

00:50:19.935 --> 00:50:22.938
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

00:50:23.355 --> 00:50:25.982
Black Tom Cassidy.
White Wade Wilson.

00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:29.194
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

00:50:29.528 --> 00:50:32.072
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

00:50:32.155 --> 00:50:33.824
You don't look like much to me.

00:50:34.741 --> 00:50:37.160
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

00:50:37.244 --> 00:50:38.844
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:45.293
Second biggest guy.

00:50:45.377 --> 00:50:47.629
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

00:50:47.879 --> 00:50:51.383
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

00:50:51.466 --> 00:50:52.866
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

00:50:54.594 --> 00:50:56.221
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:59.182
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

00:50:59.266 --> 00:51:01.518
Zip it. We're not friends.

00:51:03.228 --> 00:51:04.508
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

00:51:16.867 --> 00:51:18.577
I had so much fun!
You were like...

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.704
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

00:51:20.787 --> 00:51:21.913
Just let me die in peace.

00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:24.332
We make a great team!

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:27.294
Oh, God! We're not a team.

00:51:27.377 --> 00:51:31.673
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

00:51:31.757 --> 00:51:34.176
We're not partners or friends.

00:51:35.594 --> 00:51:37.637
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

00:51:37.721 --> 00:51:39.890
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

00:51:39.973 --> 00:51:43.518
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.813
There's only one person
in this world

00:51:46.897 --> 00:51:48.690
that I care about,
and she's gone.

00:51:50.484 --> 00:51:52.486
You wanna survive?

00:51:53.695 --> 00:51:56.990
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

00:51:57.073 --> 00:51:58.950
and make friends with them.

00:52:00.243 --> 00:52:01.828
Make friends with someone.

00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:04.664
Anyone but me.

00:52:05.832 --> 00:52:08.168
Maybe even Black Tim.

00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:10.629
Black Evan, I don't know.

00:52:10.712 --> 00:52:13.215
All I remember is
he was African-American.

00:52:58.677 --> 00:53:00.720
<i>System malfunctioning.</i>

00:53:00.804 --> 00:53:04.140
<i>Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.</i>

00:53:04.224 --> 00:53:06.434
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

00:53:06.518 --> 00:53:09.813
<i>Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.</i>

00:53:11.022 --> 00:53:12.399
<i>Searching.</i>

00:53:13.942 --> 00:53:16.319
<i>Cell 04 located.</i>

00:53:17.696 --> 00:53:19.322
Door won't open!

00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:21.491
On your fucking knees!

00:53:58.445 --> 00:54:00.155
That was our cell.

00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:04.534
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

00:54:04.618 --> 00:54:05.785
with a Winter Soldier arm?

00:54:15.045 --> 00:54:16.963
Get away from me, kid!

00:54:24.596 --> 00:54:25.805
Listen to me! Go!

00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:32.604
Hello, Russell.

00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:58.064
I don't bargain.

00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:17.208
Who are you?

00:56:18.084 --> 00:56:19.335
I'm Batman.

00:56:30.764 --> 00:56:31.806
Ooh!

00:56:36.561 --> 00:56:39.439
Oh. That's got some zip.

00:56:47.947 --> 00:56:50.742
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:52.494
Talk!

00:56:53.036 --> 00:56:54.788
What kind of
spineless shit stick

00:56:54.871 --> 00:56:56.247
tries to kill a 14-year-old boy?

00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.740
You might wanna start talking!

00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:01.211
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

00:57:02.712 --> 00:57:04.214
The name's Cable.

00:57:04.756 --> 00:57:07.425
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

00:57:08.093 --> 00:57:09.385
Oh!

00:57:09.469 --> 00:57:10.929
So, you're from the future.

00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.306
I have three questions then.

00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:16.643
One, is dubstep still a thing?

00:57:17.102 --> 00:57:19.562
Two, do people still homebrew?

00:57:19.646 --> 00:57:22.232
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:08.111
Dubstep's for pussies.

00:58:08.194 --> 00:58:09.362
You're so dark!

00:58:09.445 --> 00:58:11.656
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

00:58:12.407 --> 00:58:13.908
I love dubstep!

00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.644
Is that a fanny pack?

00:58:41.728 --> 00:58:44.314
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

00:58:45.273 --> 00:58:47.358
Something to remember you by.

00:58:47.442 --> 00:58:51.154
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

00:58:51.237 --> 00:58:53.615
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:05.418
Why are you protecting the kid?

00:59:06.753 --> 00:59:08.671
I don't give a fuck about him...

00:59:09.088 --> 00:59:11.507
and his <i>Are You My Mother?</i>
Complex!

00:59:13.843 --> 00:59:15.094
What's this one do?

00:59:29.275 --> 00:59:30.860
<i>In every film, there's a moment</i>

00:59:30.944 --> 00:59:33.279
<i>when the hero hits rock bottom.</i>

00:59:33.363 --> 00:59:35.281
<i>In</i> Cool Runnings,
<i>it was when John Candy's</i>

00:59:35.365 --> 00:59:36.658
<i>prized bobsled broke.</i>

00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:40.078
<i>In</i> Human Centipede,
<i>it was when those people...</i>

00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:41.704
<i>signed on to be in that movie.</i>

00:59:41.788 --> 00:59:43.248
<i>But in this film, well...</i>

00:59:43.957 --> 00:59:45.124
<i>you're looking at it.</i>

00:59:45.208 --> 00:59:46.960
On your fucking knees, mutant.

00:59:49.879 --> 00:59:50.880
<i>Rock...</i>

00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:56.427
<i>meet bottom.</i>

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:08.189
<i>I love you, Wade Wilson.</i>

01:00:08.273 --> 01:00:09.482
Ness?

01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:11.985
Hey, Ness!

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.654
Ness, can you let me in?

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.823
Please! Please.

01:00:18.992 --> 01:00:20.076
Jesus.

01:00:23.037 --> 01:00:24.797
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:26.624
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:31.379
Then I joined the X-Men.

01:00:31.546 --> 01:00:33.381
I went to prison. I, uh...

01:00:37.468 --> 01:00:38.970
Is it the kid?

01:00:41.014 --> 01:00:43.933
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:46.352
The kid!

01:01:00.408 --> 01:01:01.701
That's exactly what she meant.

01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:03.053
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.912
I'm not gonna abandon this kid.

01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:07.582
He's never had anyone, ever.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:08.958
I need to be selfless.

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:10.960
Yeah, but what does that mean?

01:01:11.044 --> 01:01:14.172
It means I'm gonna save Russell.

01:01:14.339 --> 01:01:15.840
Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa...

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:18.885
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

01:01:18.968 --> 01:01:21.030
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

01:01:21.054 --> 01:01:22.574
I literally don't know
what that means.

01:01:22.638 --> 01:01:23.765
Jesus Christ.

01:01:23.848 --> 01:01:26.559
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:28.394
those muties
are being transferred

01:01:28.478 --> 01:01:30.271
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

01:01:30.355 --> 01:01:32.148
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:34.359
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.402
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

01:01:36.486 --> 01:01:39.072
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:41.491
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

01:01:41.574 --> 01:01:42.992
You know what we need to do?

01:01:43.076 --> 01:01:44.827
We need to build a fucking team.

01:01:44.994 --> 01:01:47.038
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:48.498
and young enough
so they can carry

01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:49.767
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:51.626
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:54.712
I'm talking about some
<i>Ocean's 14</i> shit. <i>Rogue Two.</i>

01:01:54.796 --> 01:01:57.173
<i>John Wick 3,</i> but with
the original director.

01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:59.133
My body is an
instrument of death.

01:01:59.217 --> 01:02:00.551
Not now, Dopinder.

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:02.053
I could be of great use.

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:03.721
What's your superpower?

01:02:05.515 --> 01:02:07.141
Courage.
That's adorable.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:08.905
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:11.270
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

01:02:11.354 --> 01:02:12.355
Yes, sir.

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:13.689
I'm sorry you had to see that,

01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:15.274
although I'm glad you heard it.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.027
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:20.321
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:22.448
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:00.862
<i>Attention, all inmates!</i>

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:03.406

Oi.

01:03:20.548 --> 01:03:21.883
What the fuck do you want?

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:23.759
That's my fucking pudding.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.243
Fuck your pudding!
You like pudding?

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:47.867
Hello?

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.497
I know you're in there.

01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:10.473
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:14.018
Lonely at the top, eh?

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:16.062
They're moving us tomorrow.

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:20.316
Maybe I can get you out of here.

01:04:21.526 --> 01:04:24.695
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:28.282
We need a secret code.

01:04:31.327 --> 01:04:33.955
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

01:04:41.212 --> 01:04:42.713
We're a team.

01:04:42.797 --> 01:04:44.715
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:46.759
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

01:04:48.469 --> 01:04:49.571
Supposedly, she can rap, too.

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:50.680
Yeah.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:51.764
I like that.

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:53.266
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

01:04:53.516 --> 01:04:55.226
Meet Bedlam.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.478
Cool name! Superpowers?

01:04:57.603 --> 01:04:59.105
I can distort electrical fields.

01:05:00.356 --> 01:05:02.525
Including the one
inside your brain...

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:05.278
causing anxiety, confusion...

01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:06.445
pain.

01:05:07.405 --> 01:05:09.448
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:10.700
We can use him.

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.995
I'm Zeitgeist.

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:15.413
Cool. I like it.

01:05:15.496 --> 01:05:16.747
So you have the power

01:05:16.831 --> 01:05:19.166
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

01:05:20.209 --> 01:05:21.335
No.

01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:22.962
No, I spit acidic vomit.

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.130
Oh.
Do you want me

01:05:24.213 --> 01:05:25.548
- to demonstrate?
- No!

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:26.966
We'll take your word for it.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:29.289
Thank you. Yeah.
Listen, we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

01:05:29.343 --> 01:05:31.971
And this is the Vanisher.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:36.309
But...

01:05:37.476 --> 01:05:38.936
Vanisher!

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.149
Nice!
Right?

01:05:44.442 --> 01:05:45.526
He's not here, is he?

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.153
He may be running late.

01:05:48.738 --> 01:05:51.198
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

01:05:51.616 --> 01:05:52.825
That's good, yeah.

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.994
"Rusty" is terrible.
Toughie.

01:05:55.077 --> 01:05:57.788
So, uh, where are you from?
The planet Mojo World.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:05:59.957
So you're an alien, I guess.
Bad name.

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.667
How does that, uh, help us?

01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:04.545
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.432
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

01:06:06.464 --> 01:06:08.007
that are worse than me
at everything.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:10.259
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:12.279
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

01:06:12.303 --> 01:06:13.387
Isn't that Canada?

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:15.890
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

01:06:17.058 --> 01:06:18.517
Meet...
Domino.

01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:20.311
What's your shtick?
I'm lucky.

01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:21.687
That's not a superpower.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:23.147
Yeah, it is.
No, it isn't.

01:06:23.314 --> 01:06:24.523
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

01:06:24.607 --> 01:06:25.608
Yeah, it is.
No, it isn't.

01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:26.692
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

01:06:26.776 --> 01:06:27.777
Yeah, it is.
Really isn't.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.944
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:30.112
Told you.

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:31.530
Get out of my head!

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.282
I'm not in your head.

01:06:33.366 --> 01:06:34.646
I'm in an 11-year-old's bedroom.

01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:35.868
Well, if you're so lucky,

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.495
then what are you
doing here with us?

01:06:37.578 --> 01:06:38.663
I don't know yet.

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:39.806
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.600
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

01:06:41.624 --> 01:06:43.435
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

01:06:43.459 --> 01:06:45.294
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

01:06:46.587 --> 01:06:47.672
I don't know who that is.

01:06:47.755 --> 01:06:48.923
You're hired.

01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:50.299
Lucky me.

01:06:50.383 --> 01:06:51.592
I like her!

01:06:52.718 --> 01:06:54.011
And last, but not least...

01:06:54.095 --> 01:06:55.221
Peter.

01:06:56.597 --> 01:06:58.557
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

01:06:59.183 --> 01:07:01.060
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:02.228
No.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:04.438
I don't have one.

01:07:04.522 --> 01:07:05.815
Um, I just saw the ad.

01:07:05.898 --> 01:07:07.608
No superpowers at all?

01:07:07.692 --> 01:07:10.820
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.613
Ow! Oh!

01:07:12.697 --> 01:07:13.823
That's all the diabetes.

01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:15.157
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

01:07:15.241 --> 01:07:17.159
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.661
Yeah.

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:19.829
You're in.

01:07:19.912 --> 01:07:21.414
Yeah.
Fuck!

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:25.209
It's fulfilling work.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:31.590
Let's go!

01:07:45.229 --> 01:07:47.773
<i>This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.</i>

01:07:47.857 --> 01:07:49.233
<i>We are en route.</i>

01:07:56.824 --> 01:07:59.201
Peacetime makes people soft.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:02.580
I was born into war.

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.291
Bred into it.

01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.418
Okay.

01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:10.588
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:13.758
These restraints are pretty...

01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:15.259
People think
they understand pain.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.178
They have no concept of it

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:19.221
beyond their own
worst experience.

01:08:20.806 --> 01:08:23.976
5 years old. That's what?

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:25.561
A bee sting.

01:08:25.644 --> 01:08:26.729
Oh, yeah.

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:29.315
20 years old, shrapnel.

01:08:29.398 --> 01:08:31.692
40 years old, disease.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:36.655
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

01:08:36.739 --> 01:08:38.139
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

01:08:38.199 --> 01:08:39.784
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

01:08:39.867 --> 01:08:41.076
I've got a list.

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:43.788
We're gonna work down it.

01:08:44.497 --> 01:08:45.498
Together.

01:08:46.665 --> 01:08:48.793
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:52.046
Something that was not
meant to bend.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.231
I'm gonna stop you right there

01:08:53.255 --> 01:08:54.608
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

01:08:54.632 --> 01:08:55.925
I won't even make it to one.

01:08:56.008 --> 01:08:57.676
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.887
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:02.181
I cried when they
canceled <i>Felicity.</i>

01:09:02.598 --> 01:09:04.451
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:05.810
I have one right now.

01:09:05.893 --> 01:09:07.436
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.622
I don't want you to hurt me,

01:09:08.646 --> 01:09:10.898
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

01:09:11.857 --> 01:09:13.484
Except for where they are.

01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:15.337
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:16.570
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

01:09:16.654 --> 01:09:18.131
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

01:09:18.155 --> 01:09:19.573
You all know the plan.

01:09:19.657 --> 01:09:21.367
Intercept the convoy,

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.410
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

01:09:23.494 --> 01:09:24.495
<i>You know what,</i>

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:25.722
<i>I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.</i>

01:09:25.746 --> 01:09:28.541
<i>Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.</i>

01:09:28.624 --> 01:09:31.293
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.963
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:37.174
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:40.010
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

01:09:40.469 --> 01:09:42.263
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:44.849
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:57.778
<i>A little turbulent up here.</i>

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:06.954
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.372
but I guarantee he hasn't killed

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:10.207
as many people as melanoma has.

01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:12.668
We're getting close!

01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.670
As a former X-Man...

01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:16.630
Trainee.
Thank you, Bedlam.

01:10:16.714 --> 01:10:19.049
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:20.676
in the group's name.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:22.761
X-Men! Men!

01:10:22.845 --> 01:10:25.806
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.182
Gender neutral.

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:29.560
From now on,
we'll be known as...

01:10:31.812 --> 01:10:33.147
X-Force.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.940
Isn't that a little derivative?

01:10:35.024 --> 01:10:37.443
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

01:10:38.694 --> 01:10:40.154
That wasn't me.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.496
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.373
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:52.559
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:54.418
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.502
Yeah!

01:10:55.586 --> 01:10:57.338
I can't wait to kill!

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:59.089
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:02.009
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

01:11:02.927 --> 01:11:05.763
You know, you guys look amazing!

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:08.682
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:09.808
This is the family

01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:11.572
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:13.437
Ah, shit.

01:11:15.064 --> 01:11:16.732
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:18.609
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:20.027
about the high winds?

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.403
Gary.
My name's Peter.

01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:23.364
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:24.887
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

01:11:25.157 --> 01:11:27.409
Did he just call himself God?
I think he did.

01:11:27.493 --> 01:11:29.036
I'd like to go home.
And I'd like...

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:31.580
the McRib to be available
year round,

01:11:31.664 --> 01:11:33.457
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.668
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

01:11:35.751 --> 01:11:36.895
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:38.295
because of a light breeze?

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:41.173
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.175
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:45.177
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:47.763
Leonard, hit it!

01:11:56.522 --> 01:11:58.565
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:34.268 --> 01:12:35.644
Let's get some!

01:12:35.728 --> 01:12:36.854
Whoo!

01:12:36.937 --> 01:12:38.063
Oh, yeah!

01:12:38.147 --> 01:12:40.983
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

01:12:42.026 --> 01:12:43.485
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

01:12:43.569 --> 01:12:44.820
Whoa!

01:12:50.075 --> 01:12:51.994
Little off course here.

01:12:54.163 --> 01:12:56.999
Holy mommy fucking shit!

01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.168
Ah, there they are.

01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:02.337
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.798
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:13.807
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:17.311
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:19.063
Left!

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:20.481
Left!

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:22.775
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:25.069
No, stage left, you idiot!

01:13:28.989 --> 01:13:30.491
Well, I guess we found something

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:31.658
you're not better at.

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:35.162
Vanisher.

01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.997
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.543
Oh! Really?

01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:43.420
All right,
we could do this with four.

01:13:44.004 --> 01:13:46.965
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

01:13:47.049 --> 01:13:49.176
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:52.429
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

01:13:52.513 --> 01:13:54.014
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

01:13:54.098 --> 01:13:55.265
We did it!

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:56.850
You're a goddamn superhero, you!

01:13:56.934 --> 01:13:58.018
X-Force!

01:13:58.644 --> 01:13:59.728
X-Force.

01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:05.984
Oh!

01:14:09.696 --> 01:14:10.697
Peter.

01:14:10.781 --> 01:14:11.782
I got you, buddy!

01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:12.967
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:15.619
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.121
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

01:14:17.204 --> 01:14:19.331
Yeah, we're X-Force.
We're X-Force.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:25.379
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.422
Fucking acidic vomit!

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:31.760
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:37.266
Okay, I'm over the convoy.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:39.184
Where did the rest
of the team land?

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.436
Good news and bad news.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.606
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.774
The good news is,

01:14:45.858 --> 01:14:47.818
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:51.196
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:52.281
<i>Peter!</i>

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:53.782
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most.

01:14:53.866 --> 01:14:54.986
But there is a slight chance

01:14:55.033 --> 01:14:56.368
Vanisher could make it.

01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:58.996
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

01:14:59.079 --> 01:15:00.247
<i>The whole team?</i>

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.124
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:03.458
<i>Fuck, you are dumb.</i>

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.127
Whoever planned this stunt's

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.379
been smoking a lot jazz cabbage.

01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:08.547
I'll tell you that much.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.257
<i>That's pretty obvious!</i>

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:12.050
Looking good, Vanisher.

01:15:21.894 --> 01:15:23.770
They're headed into the tunnel.

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:26.190
I'm that kid's only hope,

01:15:26.273 --> 01:15:28.150
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:29.902
<i>Whatever.</i>

01:15:29.985 --> 01:15:31.212
<i>We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.</i>

01:15:31.236 --> 01:15:34.156
<i>Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.</i>

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.742
<i>Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!</i>

01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:39.870
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

01:15:42.998 --> 01:15:45.626
<i>Seriously, I don't get it!</i>

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:48.170
<i>What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?</i>

01:15:50.339 --> 01:15:52.132
<i>It's just it's hard to picture.</i>

01:15:52.216 --> 01:15:54.343
<i>And certainly
not very cinematic.</i>

01:15:57.012 --> 01:15:58.597
<i>I mean, luck?</i>

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.183
<i>What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking</i>

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:02.601
<i>freakshow comic book artist...</i>

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:04.269
<i>came up
with that little chestnut?</i>

01:16:04.353 --> 01:16:06.647
<i>Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!</i>

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:20.994
<i>Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.</i>

01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:22.305
<i>It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.</i>

01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:23.369
<i>Wander the Earth...</i>
I'm in.

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:24.873
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:26.041
<i>I'm in.</i>

01:16:26.124 --> 01:16:28.001
How in the fuck
are you in already?

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:29.711
Oh, shit.

01:16:30.295 --> 01:16:31.505
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:32.631
<i>Okay.</i>

01:16:32.714 --> 01:16:35.133
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:37.928
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:39.638
I'm coming up on your six.

01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:49.898
That gun is amazing!

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:00.993
Hey!
Asshole!

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:02.744
<i>Where is he?
I can't see him.</i>

01:17:02.828 --> 01:17:04.329
<i>He's on top of you.</i>

01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:06.081
<i>He's tearing you open!</i>

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:07.958
<i>He's going in through the back!</i>

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.584
<i>Oh, God, he's inside!</i>

01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:10.919
You hear yourself, right?

01:17:11.003 --> 01:17:12.421
<i>Accidental double entendres!</i>

01:17:12.504 --> 01:17:14.965
Russell! Russell Collins!

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:16.967
Hands off that kid, John Connor!

01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:22.973
No, no, no!

01:17:27.311 --> 01:17:28.437
Shit!

01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:52.294
Two can play that game!

01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:56.256
Got it! No, I don't.

01:17:57.257 --> 01:17:58.258
<i>Showtime, mama!</i>

01:17:58.342 --> 01:17:59.968
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:39.609
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

01:18:39.633 --> 01:18:41.676
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

01:18:58.276 --> 01:18:59.277
Hang in there, Doms!

01:19:00.612 --> 01:19:02.239
Oh, this is really hard.

01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:15.919
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:21.007
You're doing great.
X-Force.

01:19:22.968 --> 01:19:24.970
I guess dubstep never dies.

01:19:29.266 --> 01:19:30.308
Whoo!

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.985
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:43.905
That's unfortunate.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:48.285
We got no brakes!

01:19:48.452 --> 01:19:49.703
Figure it out!

01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:55.625
There's nothing I can't kill.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.922
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

01:20:01.006 --> 01:20:03.341
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

01:20:05.051 --> 01:20:06.636
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

01:20:21.485 --> 01:20:23.403
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:24.988
Here we go.

01:20:26.072 --> 01:20:28.283
Domino, mind slowing us down?

01:20:28.366 --> 01:20:30.452
Here goes nothing.

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:03.401
Knock, knock.

01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:10.951
That's my boy.

01:21:17.374 --> 01:21:18.542
Holy...

01:21:28.843 --> 01:21:30.428
<i>I'll be first to admit...</i>

01:21:30.512 --> 01:21:32.889
<i>this did not go
according to plan.</i>

01:21:34.224 --> 01:21:35.767
<i>I'll also be the first
to admit that</i>

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:37.686
<i>that plan was written in crayon.</i>

01:21:37.769 --> 01:21:40.981
<i>Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.</i>

01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:42.607
<i>Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,</i>

01:21:42.691 --> 01:21:45.569
<i>and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.</i>

01:21:45.652 --> 01:21:48.905
<i>But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.</i>

01:21:48.989 --> 01:21:50.156
A mood that is

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.033
about to get
significantly worse.

01:22:15.807 --> 01:22:18.226
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

01:22:21.187 --> 01:22:22.647
Oh.

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:26.067
Oh, God, that hurt.

01:22:26.151 --> 01:22:27.777
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

01:22:31.323 --> 01:22:32.407
Russell.

01:22:35.118 --> 01:22:36.202
Russell!

01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:38.913
Russ, where are ya?

01:22:42.542 --> 01:22:44.628
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:47.964
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

01:22:48.256 --> 01:22:49.466
Juggernaut!

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.802
I thought that was you!

01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:54.971
I should've worn my white pants.

01:22:55.722 --> 01:22:58.725
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:02.896
<i>Uncanny X-Men</i> 183. <i>Thor</i> 411.

01:23:02.979 --> 01:23:04.272
<i>X-Men Unlimited</i> 12.

01:23:04.356 --> 01:23:06.441
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:08.276
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.528
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:12.113
I don't mean right now.

01:23:12.447 --> 01:23:14.324
I'm gonna rip you in half now.

01:23:14.407 --> 01:23:16.743
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:24.834
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

01:23:24.918 --> 01:23:26.002
I can't feel...

01:23:26.961 --> 01:23:28.463
Oh, no, they're right here.

01:23:29.297 --> 01:23:31.049
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.967
I have a mission.

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:34.636
To get my revenge.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:37.389
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

01:23:37.472 --> 01:23:39.641
You're not the revenge type.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:40.892
Take it from a friend.

01:23:41.309 --> 01:23:45.021
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.315
You said it yourself.

01:23:47.399 --> 01:23:50.068
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:51.361
So I did.

01:23:53.113 --> 01:23:55.156
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

01:23:55.323 --> 01:23:58.785
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

01:23:59.369 --> 01:24:01.204
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:03.123
I care about you, Russell.

01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:05.834
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:09.087
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:12.424
Legs!
Still hurts to hear out loud!

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:17.512
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:19.931
You get back here, young man!

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:22.016
Doms!

01:24:22.392 --> 01:24:24.561
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:27.063
Use my arms as backpack straps.

01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:30.859
I think we may have found

01:24:30.942 --> 01:24:32.736
your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:24:33.153 --> 01:24:34.904
I'm pretty sure this isn't it.

01:24:34.988 --> 01:24:36.239
X-Force.

01:24:49.753 --> 01:24:51.546
<i>No child is hopeless.</i>

01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:54.424
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

01:24:55.175 --> 01:24:57.427
It was the coldness in his eyes.

01:24:57.886 --> 01:24:59.471
You should've heard it.

01:25:01.389 --> 01:25:03.683
I guess family
really is an F-word.

01:25:04.601 --> 01:25:06.770
Rub my legs, Mama.

01:25:06.853 --> 01:25:08.229
Why would I rub your legs?

01:25:08.313 --> 01:25:10.899
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.570
What in the...

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:18.323
Why is your hand so tiny again?

01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:20.200
That's not my hand.

01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.535
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.996
That was nice for me.

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:27.832
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

01:25:32.337 --> 01:25:34.172
Why wouldn't you cover that up?

01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:36.841
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:25:36.925 --> 01:25:38.843
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

01:25:38.927 --> 01:25:40.929
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

01:25:41.012 --> 01:25:42.430
toddler-style.

01:25:42.514 --> 01:25:44.432
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

01:25:44.516 --> 01:25:46.476
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

01:25:46.559 --> 01:25:47.828
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

01:25:47.852 --> 01:25:49.437
It's like, um...
Here we go.

01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:50.790
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

01:25:50.814 --> 01:25:52.315
but they quit halfway through.

01:25:52.398 --> 01:25:53.542
They got the legs out,
and they said,

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:54.901
"You know what, I'm done."

01:25:54.984 --> 01:25:55.985
Happy?

01:25:56.069 --> 01:25:57.171
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

01:25:57.195 --> 01:25:58.530
But this time, you can see

01:25:58.613 --> 01:26:00.031
the Muppet's dick.

01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:01.300
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

01:26:01.324 --> 01:26:02.676
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.369
I've had three tickets already.

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:08.456
No, no, no, DP, not again!

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:10.333
This has happened before?

01:26:11.459 --> 01:26:12.877
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

01:26:12.961 --> 01:26:14.254
The indecision is killing me.

01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:16.214
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

01:26:17.799 --> 01:26:19.968
Oh. Wow!

01:26:20.051 --> 01:26:21.678
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

01:26:21.761 --> 01:26:23.346
I'm talking about your face.

01:26:23.763 --> 01:26:25.640
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

01:26:25.723 --> 01:26:27.892
Jesus Christ!
Looks like an avocado.

01:26:27.976 --> 01:26:29.602
Your legs, though, they're cute.

01:26:29.936 --> 01:26:31.729
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

01:26:33.314 --> 01:26:34.858
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

01:26:34.941 --> 01:26:37.235
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

01:26:37.694 --> 01:26:39.279
I'll tell you why I'm here.

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:41.656
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

01:26:41.739 --> 01:26:42.967
beat me within
an inch of my life.

01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:44.242
He was torturing me!

01:26:44.325 --> 01:26:47.245
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:49.497
So, I'm here to help us gear up.

01:26:49.998 --> 01:26:51.183
So we can go after him
without me.

01:26:51.207 --> 01:26:52.208
No!

01:26:52.625 --> 01:26:53.960
I'm doing this alone.

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:55.128
The Juggernaut

01:26:55.211 --> 01:26:56.411
will kill you all.
Fair enough.

01:26:56.462 --> 01:26:58.506
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:59.674
under me.
What will you do?

01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:01.110
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

01:27:01.134 --> 01:27:02.427
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:03.863
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

01:27:03.887 --> 01:27:05.889
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:07.724
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:08.868
The first order of business is

01:27:08.892 --> 01:27:10.035
to get me in front of Cable...

01:27:10.059 --> 01:27:11.745
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

01:27:11.769 --> 01:27:14.105
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

01:27:14.188 --> 01:27:15.940
Then, I'm gonna take his skin...

01:27:16.024 --> 01:27:19.110
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

01:27:20.695 --> 01:27:22.295
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

01:27:30.955 --> 01:27:32.707
What in the ass?

01:27:32.999 --> 01:27:36.085
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

01:27:36.377 --> 01:27:38.922
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

01:27:39.464 --> 01:27:42.008
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.930
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

01:27:47.096 --> 01:27:48.139
What can we help you with?

01:27:48.848 --> 01:27:50.516
I'm here to proposition you.

01:27:52.018 --> 01:27:53.102
Oh, boy!

01:27:53.186 --> 01:27:54.246
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.356
Who gets to make the first joke?

01:27:56.439 --> 01:27:57.791
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

01:27:57.815 --> 01:27:58.816
Good call.

01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:00.443
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

01:28:00.526 --> 01:28:01.754
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

01:28:01.778 --> 01:28:02.862
Fuck!

01:28:02.946 --> 01:28:04.048
<i>The Proposition</i> has a wonderful

01:28:04.072 --> 01:28:05.073
Guy Pearce performance.

01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:06.908
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

01:28:07.241 --> 01:28:09.327
Give us the line again.
I need your help!

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:12.163
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:14.874
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.669
I can't bring him down alone.

01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:19.379
So here we are.

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:22.465
We're no longer
accepting applications

01:28:22.548 --> 01:28:23.925
for X-Force, unfortunately.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.426
Even if we were...

01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:27.196
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.388
We don't have a lot of time.

01:28:28.471 --> 01:28:30.223
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

01:28:30.306 --> 01:28:31.786
No offense,
but if you know so much...

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:34.185
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

01:28:34.769 --> 01:28:35.829
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:36.854
kill baby Hitler.

01:28:36.938 --> 01:28:38.898
I use a device
to slide through time.

01:28:38.982 --> 01:28:41.609
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

01:28:41.693 --> 01:28:44.278
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.488
one to get me home.

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:46.698
Well.

01:28:46.781 --> 01:28:48.658
That's just lazy writing.

01:28:48.741 --> 01:28:50.010
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

01:28:50.034 --> 01:28:51.577
of the orphanage tonight.

01:28:51.661 --> 01:28:53.746
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:56.541
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

01:28:56.624 --> 01:28:58.584
So he keeps killing...

01:28:58.668 --> 01:29:00.128
and killing, and killing,

01:29:00.211 --> 01:29:01.421
and killing.

01:29:01.754 --> 01:29:04.966
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

01:29:07.552 --> 01:29:08.928
My people.

01:29:12.849 --> 01:29:13.975
Relax.

01:29:14.058 --> 01:29:16.519
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

01:29:16.602 --> 01:29:19.147
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:21.774
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

01:29:21.858 --> 01:29:23.526
The difference is night and day.

01:29:25.361 --> 01:29:27.488
You remind me of my wife.

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:28.781
I'm sorry.

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:30.300
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

01:29:30.324 --> 01:29:31.677
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

01:29:31.701 --> 01:29:34.454
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:35.705
She always struggled.

01:29:36.831 --> 01:29:38.249
But she was funny...

01:29:38.332 --> 01:29:40.835
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:43.921
Something I could never master.

01:29:44.839 --> 01:29:47.050
It was my fault she died.

01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:51.345
It was my job
to stop people like him.

01:29:52.388 --> 01:29:54.348
<i>I came close a few times.</i>

01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:00.229
<i>He wasn't too happy about that.</i>

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:03.066
<i>He was trying to hurt me...</i>

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:05.109
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

01:30:09.155 --> 01:30:10.823
Blessed are the wicked

01:30:10.907 --> 01:30:12.492
who are healed by my hand.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.038
<i>He came into my home...</i>

01:30:17.997 --> 01:30:20.875
<i>and took the only thing
that made it a home.</i>

01:30:25.088 --> 01:30:26.464
Sound familiar?

01:30:27.507 --> 01:30:29.092
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.

01:30:29.175 --> 01:30:30.843
No, I'm really sorry.

01:30:33.054 --> 01:30:35.181
But that isn't Russell.

01:30:35.264 --> 01:30:37.159
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

01:30:37.183 --> 01:30:39.185
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:40.770
maybe a small
learning disability...

01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:42.230
splash of diabetes...

01:30:42.313 --> 01:30:43.606
but nothing that can't be fixed.

01:30:43.689 --> 01:30:45.316
If you could go back...

01:30:45.399 --> 01:30:48.069
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:49.570
No.

01:30:49.654 --> 01:30:51.364
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:53.199
Of course I fucking would!

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:55.034
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

01:30:55.118 --> 01:30:57.120
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

01:30:57.203 --> 01:30:58.746
I'll kill the kid.

01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:02.291
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.669
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

01:31:04.752 --> 01:31:06.754
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

01:31:06.838 --> 01:31:09.090
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

01:31:10.091 --> 01:31:12.677
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

01:31:13.344 --> 01:31:15.012
Give me a chance to save him.

01:31:15.096 --> 01:31:16.514
What?
You said...

01:31:16.597 --> 01:31:18.242
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

01:31:18.266 --> 01:31:20.601
If we can get to him
before that happens...

01:31:20.685 --> 01:31:22.311
promise you'll give me a chance

01:31:22.395 --> 01:31:24.188
to put him on a different path.

01:31:24.272 --> 01:31:25.439
Define "chance."

01:31:25.523 --> 01:31:26.750
I don't know.
How long does it take

01:31:26.774 --> 01:31:28.127
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

01:31:28.151 --> 01:31:29.402
I'll give you 30 seconds.

01:31:29.485 --> 01:31:31.487
What? No!
Best I can do.

01:31:31.571 --> 01:31:32.864
Take it or leave it.

01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:44.750
He's doing it!

01:31:44.834 --> 01:31:46.394
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.337
There he goes.

01:31:48.504 --> 01:31:49.922
Jesus Christ!

01:31:50.006 --> 01:31:51.465
Just shirt-cocking it.

01:31:51.549 --> 01:31:52.550
Ugh.

01:31:53.509 --> 01:31:54.844
There you go, little fella.

01:31:55.595 --> 01:31:56.929
Go on, you're doing it!

01:31:57.346 --> 01:32:00.183
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

01:32:02.393 --> 01:32:03.477
Christ!

01:32:03.561 --> 01:32:05.188
That's disturbing.

01:32:05.271 --> 01:32:06.689
30 seconds.

01:32:12.069 --> 01:32:13.571
Deal.
Deal.

01:32:19.994 --> 01:32:23.039
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

01:32:23.122 --> 01:32:25.082
I really wanted to match,
you know?

01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:27.168
Being a menacing team.

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:28.377
Oh, man, it sucks.

01:32:28.461 --> 01:32:30.046
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

01:32:31.756 --> 01:32:34.258
And that is just
the first five steps

01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:36.052
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

01:32:36.969 --> 01:32:38.387
Where the hell are we going?

01:32:38.471 --> 01:32:39.722
You said it yourself.

01:32:39.805 --> 01:32:42.725
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

01:32:42.808 --> 01:32:45.561
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

01:32:49.899 --> 01:32:51.525
Can you turn off the music?

01:32:52.526 --> 01:32:54.528
You'll do no such thing.

01:32:54.695 --> 01:32:56.530
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

01:32:56.614 --> 01:32:58.324
I'm sorry?
Apology accepted.

01:32:58.407 --> 01:33:00.451
This is a side of you
I do not like.

01:33:00.534 --> 01:33:01.535
Let me guess,

01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:03.430
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

01:33:03.454 --> 01:33:04.580
What the hell are you...?

01:33:04.664 --> 01:33:06.582
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

01:33:06.666 --> 01:33:07.917
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.543
I'm not a fucking racist, moron!

01:33:09.627 --> 01:33:11.504
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

01:33:11.712 --> 01:33:13.339
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

01:33:13.422 --> 01:33:14.632
And that's a twist.

01:33:14.715 --> 01:33:15.841
When this is over...

01:33:15.925 --> 01:33:18.153
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

01:33:18.177 --> 01:33:20.304
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

01:33:20.388 --> 01:33:21.764
I should have finished college.

01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:22.932
So what exactly do you

01:33:23.015 --> 01:33:24.076
do in the future, anyway, huh?

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.309
Some kind of soldier?

01:33:25.393 --> 01:33:27.186
Yeah, something like that.

01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:29.438
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

01:33:29.522 --> 01:33:32.149
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

01:33:32.233 --> 01:33:34.193
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

01:33:34.277 --> 01:33:36.654
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

01:33:36.737 --> 01:33:38.281
Boom!

01:33:38.364 --> 01:33:39.615
Spoiler alert.

01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:42.076
Planets.

01:33:42.243 --> 01:33:43.786
Next time, Uber.

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:45.162
Here's a spoiler alert.

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:48.124
You're not a fucking hero.

01:33:48.332 --> 01:33:52.044
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.587
Well, I got news for you.

01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:54.964
My heart is in the right place.

01:33:55.047 --> 01:33:56.549
Russell's not gonna kill anyone.

01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:58.610
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

01:33:58.634 --> 01:33:59.677
We're all going to die.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.029
Because of you, I'll always know

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:02.930
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

01:34:03.055 --> 01:34:05.349
I'm a grower, not a shower.

01:34:05.516 --> 01:34:06.642
God, I wish this were a bus

01:34:06.726 --> 01:34:07.911
where I could pull
the string and get out.

01:34:07.935 --> 01:34:09.562
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

01:34:09.645 --> 01:34:10.646
or you'd be in the back.

01:34:10.855 --> 01:34:12.648
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:33.044
I made mistakes!

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:35.046
I wanna take them back!

01:34:35.212 --> 01:34:38.090
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

01:34:38.215 --> 01:34:39.633
and turned it into a glory hole

01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:41.218
in an airport bathroom.

01:34:41.302 --> 01:34:44.055
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

01:34:44.638 --> 01:34:47.183
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

01:34:47.266 --> 01:34:48.768
I was once an X-Man.

01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:49.894
Trainee!

01:34:54.565 --> 01:34:57.068
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

01:34:57.151 --> 01:34:58.736
They do stick better than tape.

01:34:58.819 --> 01:34:59.820
Hi, Wade!

01:34:59.904 --> 01:35:00.905
Please don't.

01:35:00.988 --> 01:35:03.741
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

01:35:03.824 --> 01:35:04.825
Right. Quick.

01:35:04.909 --> 01:35:06.786
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:07.870
And just like me,

01:35:07.953 --> 01:35:09.222
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

01:35:09.246 --> 01:35:10.557
because the whole world
wrote him off

01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:11.957
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

01:35:12.041 --> 01:35:13.709
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

01:35:13.793 --> 01:35:14.960
The Juggernaut!

01:35:15.336 --> 01:35:17.105
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.298
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

01:35:19.382 --> 01:35:20.716
so I'm saying hi back.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.134
You guys make
a super cute couple.

01:35:22.218 --> 01:35:23.886
Yeah. Where was I?

01:35:23.969 --> 01:35:25.805
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

01:35:25.888 --> 01:35:27.556
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:29.451
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

01:35:29.475 --> 01:35:30.744
and causes nothing but problems!

01:35:30.768 --> 01:35:33.771
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

01:35:33.854 --> 01:35:37.024
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

01:35:37.108 --> 01:35:39.151
I would be disgraced.

01:35:39.235 --> 01:35:41.237
You are a criminal, a fugitive.

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.822
But worst of all...

01:35:42.905 --> 01:35:44.657
you broke my heart, Wade.

01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:47.368
Then you know what?

01:35:47.451 --> 01:35:49.051
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

01:35:50.246 --> 01:35:52.915
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

01:35:52.998 --> 01:35:56.335
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

01:35:56.419 --> 01:35:59.505
So stay here
in Château de Virgin...

01:35:59.588 --> 01:36:01.715
while we go get our fuck on!

01:36:04.885 --> 01:36:06.262
You're doing great.

01:36:11.934 --> 01:36:13.394
So you wear that helmet because

01:36:13.477 --> 01:36:15.187
your brother
tries to read your mind?

01:36:15.271 --> 01:36:18.482
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

01:36:18.566 --> 01:36:21.026
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:23.028
And he's not alone.

01:36:23.112 --> 01:36:24.780
Secure the children.

01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:29.577
They will not replace us.

01:36:29.994 --> 01:36:32.288
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

01:36:32.830 --> 01:36:36.667
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

01:36:40.004 --> 01:36:42.465
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

01:36:42.673 --> 01:36:44.216
Amen, brother.

01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:52.266
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:36:52.433 --> 01:36:54.059
30 seconds.

01:36:54.685 --> 01:36:56.812
I finally know why I'm here.

01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:59.148
I was raised in this place.

01:36:59.231 --> 01:37:01.442
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

01:37:01.525 --> 01:37:04.361
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:37:04.445 --> 01:37:05.738
Shall we?
This is gonna be fun.

01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:06.864
Yeah!

01:37:06.947 --> 01:37:08.282
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

01:37:08.365 --> 01:37:11.619
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

01:37:11.702 --> 01:37:14.371
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

01:37:14.914 --> 01:37:17.291
<i>Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.</i>

01:37:17.666 --> 01:37:19.043
Give me some.

01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:20.628
They say
laughter heals anything...

01:37:20.753 --> 01:37:21.837
except, of course, that.

01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:23.130
We should just cue the music.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.991
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

01:37:52.201 --> 01:37:53.202
Russell!

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:55.704
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

01:37:56.747 --> 01:37:58.267
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

01:38:02.378 --> 01:38:03.379
That's why!

01:38:03.462 --> 01:38:04.564
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

01:38:04.588 --> 01:38:06.715
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

01:38:06.799 --> 01:38:08.759
Hey!

01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:12.429
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

01:38:13.556 --> 01:38:15.724
My body and my hands
are so soft.

01:38:15.808 --> 01:38:17.077
You should probably
head back to the car.

01:38:17.101 --> 01:38:18.644
I think I'll head
back to the car.

01:38:19.937 --> 01:38:22.606
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

01:38:25.526 --> 01:38:26.819
That gun is amazing!

01:38:28.153 --> 01:38:29.363
Say it!

01:38:31.532 --> 01:38:34.535
You are an abomination!

01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:45.129
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

01:38:45.212 --> 01:38:47.631
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

01:38:52.011 --> 01:38:53.095
Gotcha!

01:38:53.887 --> 01:38:55.055
Beat it, midget!

01:38:58.058 --> 01:39:00.769
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:02.271
Oh, shit fuck!

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:17.745
Come here, beautiful.

01:39:25.502 --> 01:39:26.629
Whoo!

01:39:35.846 --> 01:39:36.930
Say it!

01:41:00.389 --> 01:41:01.473
You came for me.

01:41:01.557 --> 01:41:02.975
I'm not giving up on you,

01:41:03.058 --> 01:41:05.144
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

01:41:05.227 --> 01:41:07.229
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

01:41:07.312 --> 01:41:09.565
It's time to fight dirty.

01:41:09.732 --> 01:41:11.066
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:13.902
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

01:41:13.986 --> 01:41:16.029
That's such a you thing to say!

01:41:16.113 --> 01:41:17.698
Go get him, tiger!

01:41:18.115 --> 01:41:19.992
Big CGI fight coming up!

01:41:43.056 --> 01:41:44.391
He's doing great.

01:41:44.475 --> 01:41:45.684
Say it!

01:41:49.855 --> 01:41:51.273
- Russell.
- Bingo!

01:41:56.653 --> 01:41:58.614
You see that bus?

01:41:58.697 --> 01:41:59.937
I'm gonna shove it up your ass.

01:42:03.285 --> 01:42:05.245
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

01:42:06.622 --> 01:42:07.622
Oh, great!

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:08.725
There they are!
Those freaks!

01:42:08.749 --> 01:42:10.509
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

01:42:10.793 --> 01:42:12.461
Can I have one of those guns?

01:42:13.003 --> 01:42:14.671
No.
That's fine.

01:42:14.838 --> 01:42:16.673
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.040
I'm just gonna use this brick.

01:42:18.592 --> 01:42:19.593
Maximum effort.

01:42:25.724 --> 01:42:27.476
Who says you
can't go home again?

01:42:36.568 --> 01:42:37.986
Oh!

01:42:44.618 --> 01:42:45.619
Yeah!

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:49.164
Say it.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:52.584
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

01:42:53.126 --> 01:42:54.127
Say it!

01:42:54.211 --> 01:42:57.214
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

01:42:58.423 --> 01:43:00.050
Blessed are the wicked...

01:43:00.592 --> 01:43:01.802
who are healed...

01:43:02.302 --> 01:43:03.804
by my hand.

01:43:21.864 --> 01:43:23.574
You commie motherfucker!

01:43:50.642 --> 01:43:52.352
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

01:43:53.228 --> 01:43:55.439
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

01:43:58.317 --> 01:44:00.527
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

01:44:00.694 --> 01:44:01.904
Now we're getting it.

01:44:06.617 --> 01:44:08.827
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

01:44:14.166 --> 01:44:15.208
Orphans.

01:44:16.376 --> 01:44:17.586
Oh, geez.

01:44:19.004 --> 01:44:21.590
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

01:44:21.757 --> 01:44:24.259
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:34.144
Russell! Wait!

01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:41.443
Oh!

01:44:48.659 --> 01:44:50.661
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

01:44:50.827 --> 01:44:52.847
What more do you need to see?
Don't you fucking dare!

01:44:52.871 --> 01:44:53.956
He's just a kid!

01:44:54.122 --> 01:44:55.999
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.765
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.788
I told you! Leave me alone!
Come on!

01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.456
Listen to me!

01:45:59.688 --> 01:46:01.314
That's how we do it

01:46:01.398 --> 01:46:02.858
in Mother Russia.

01:46:05.193 --> 01:46:07.612
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

01:46:08.989 --> 01:46:12.200
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

01:46:13.535 --> 01:46:16.038
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

01:46:16.455 --> 01:46:18.165
Go home, Wade!

01:46:18.331 --> 01:46:20.167
You're ruining everything!

01:46:25.505 --> 01:46:26.715
I'm getting good at this shit.

01:46:26.882 --> 01:46:27.924
Go, go, go!

01:46:31.428 --> 01:46:33.263
He dies tonight, Wade.

01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:34.973
You can't stop me!

01:46:35.932 --> 01:46:37.684
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:40.604
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:43.422
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

01:46:43.565 --> 01:46:45.445
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

01:46:45.609 --> 01:46:46.943
I got this.

01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:49.237
Russell!
Stay back! Go home, Wade!

01:46:49.404 --> 01:46:51.531
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

01:46:52.115 --> 01:46:53.408
That piece of shit...

01:46:53.825 --> 01:46:55.465
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

01:46:55.619 --> 01:46:58.997
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

01:46:59.873 --> 01:47:01.541
But if you kill him, he wins.

01:47:01.708 --> 01:47:05.212
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:07.089
You're just a kid.

01:47:07.672 --> 01:47:09.299
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:47:09.466 --> 01:47:10.592
How do you know what I want?

01:47:10.759 --> 01:47:12.385
Because I've been inside you.

01:47:13.053 --> 01:47:14.346
That came out wrong.

01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:16.556
I've been inside your shoes.

01:47:16.723 --> 01:47:18.475
Which is also off-putting.

01:47:18.642 --> 01:47:20.060
It's not a great analogy.

01:47:20.143 --> 01:47:21.561
The point is...

01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:23.688
there are people...

01:47:23.772 --> 01:47:26.691
There are people
in this fucking world...

01:47:26.858 --> 01:47:29.444
besides him,
who will treat you right.

01:47:29.611 --> 01:47:32.239
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

01:47:37.786 --> 01:47:40.163
I never should've left
you there.

01:47:41.915 --> 01:47:43.792
I never should've left you
in that prison.

01:47:50.882 --> 01:47:52.175
I can't trust you.

01:47:53.885 --> 01:47:56.263
I can't trust anybody!

01:48:05.272 --> 01:48:06.481
Wonderful kid.

01:48:06.982 --> 01:48:08.525
You can't stop me, Wade!

01:48:10.777 --> 01:48:12.904
I got one more idea.

01:48:13.071 --> 01:48:15.949
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

01:48:16.032 --> 01:48:17.200
Wade, what are you doing?

01:48:17.284 --> 01:48:19.004
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

01:48:19.703 --> 01:48:21.413
You're gonna kill
someone today...

01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:23.123
Blessed are the wicked...

01:48:23.290 --> 01:48:25.208
then it's gotta be me.

01:48:26.293 --> 01:48:28.211
Who are healed by my hand!

01:48:31.339 --> 01:48:33.758
Fuck this!

01:49:34.486 --> 01:49:37.447
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:49:42.452 --> 01:49:43.954
Oh, that's not good.

01:49:45.538 --> 01:49:46.957
No, sir.

01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:57.509
You sacrificed yourself for me.

01:49:57.926 --> 01:49:59.052
Yeah.

01:49:59.135 --> 01:50:01.346
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

01:50:03.306 --> 01:50:05.392
I told you I care about you.

01:50:05.475 --> 01:50:07.227
You're a good kid, Russell.

01:50:08.937 --> 01:50:10.021
Hey.

01:50:11.314 --> 01:50:12.524
The bear.

01:50:12.607 --> 01:50:13.984
It worked.

01:50:20.949 --> 01:50:22.450
Because of you.

01:50:22.617 --> 01:50:24.911
No, Wade, because of you.

01:50:25.787 --> 01:50:27.831
Stop, stop, stop!

01:50:27.914 --> 01:50:29.082
Stop!

01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:32.794
Just let it happen, okay?

01:50:33.253 --> 01:50:36.172
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

01:50:37.007 --> 01:50:39.426
That riddle is so fucked up.

01:50:44.222 --> 01:50:46.516
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:50:46.683 --> 01:50:47.809
Don't be. Don't be.

01:50:47.892 --> 01:50:49.812
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

01:50:50.312 --> 01:50:51.855
Please, just don't leave me.

01:50:52.022 --> 01:50:53.523
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

01:50:53.690 --> 01:50:55.191
We are not going anywhere.

01:50:55.358 --> 01:50:57.444
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

01:50:57.527 --> 01:50:58.653
Just rest, okay?

01:51:00.488 --> 01:51:01.573
Papa.

01:51:03.783 --> 01:51:05.744
<i>Papa, can you hear me?</i>

01:51:07.996 --> 01:51:14.002
<i>Papa, can you find me
in the night?</i>

01:51:35.273 --> 01:51:36.524
Before I go...

01:51:37.067 --> 01:51:38.777
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

01:51:39.361 --> 01:51:40.487
Domino.

01:51:40.653 --> 01:51:45.158
I want you to have
my <i>Adventure Time</i> watch.

01:51:47.744 --> 01:51:50.622
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

01:51:51.373 --> 01:51:52.499
Thank you.

01:51:53.833 --> 01:51:56.753
Hey, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.

01:51:57.128 --> 01:51:59.297
I liked you better
with your hair short.

01:51:59.464 --> 01:52:00.632
Think everyone did.

01:52:01.424 --> 01:52:04.135
Hi, Yukio.
Hi, Wade!

01:52:06.179 --> 01:52:07.263
And you...

01:52:07.806 --> 01:52:08.932
Chrome Bone.

01:52:09.849 --> 01:52:12.227
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

01:52:12.811 --> 01:52:15.063
But you've always been
that to me.

01:52:15.146 --> 01:52:16.523
So thank you.

01:52:18.691 --> 01:52:20.276
Say "fuck" for me.

01:52:21.111 --> 01:52:22.362
Just once. Come on,

01:52:22.445 --> 01:52:24.030
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

01:52:24.114 --> 01:52:27.117
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.201
Fuck.

01:52:28.368 --> 01:52:31.704
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

01:52:33.039 --> 01:52:35.291
And you, Cable.

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:39.838
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

01:52:40.713 --> 01:52:43.925
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

01:52:44.384 --> 01:52:45.760
That you'll start
judging people...

01:52:45.844 --> 01:52:47.178
not by the color of their skin,

01:52:47.262 --> 01:52:49.139
but by the content
of their character.

01:52:49.889 --> 01:52:51.474
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

01:52:52.684 --> 01:52:54.602
There you are. Hey!

01:52:55.186 --> 01:52:56.938
You're a superhero now, bubba.

01:52:57.439 --> 01:53:00.400
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

01:53:00.483 --> 01:53:01.860
This one is yours.

01:53:01.943 --> 01:53:03.653
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

01:53:03.736 --> 01:53:05.113
Especially around the pants.

01:53:05.196 --> 01:53:06.906
And let it out
a little in the waist.

01:53:07.866 --> 01:53:08.867
But, hey.

01:53:09.909 --> 01:53:10.994
Look.

01:53:11.286 --> 01:53:13.913
Family is not an F-word.

01:53:14.664 --> 01:53:15.957
All right?

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.917
There's one out there for you.

01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:20.211
Just keep looking, okay?

01:53:23.715 --> 01:53:26.468
Guys, for a second there...

01:53:27.302 --> 01:53:29.429
we made a pretty good team.

01:53:44.486 --> 01:53:46.488
Oh, it's so hard to go.

01:53:47.989 --> 01:53:50.366
I just love being around
you guys so much.

01:53:51.451 --> 01:53:52.702
So, so much.

01:53:53.411 --> 01:53:54.746
Mmm.

01:53:54.829 --> 01:53:56.998
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

01:53:57.707 --> 01:54:01.461
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

01:54:01.544 --> 01:54:02.545
Yeah.

01:54:04.422 --> 01:54:06.257
Can you see it?

01:54:06.966 --> 01:54:09.135
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

01:54:10.595 --> 01:54:11.763
There it is.

01:54:18.019 --> 01:54:19.229
Oh, that's the sun.

01:54:19.312 --> 01:54:21.147
Don't stare directly into that.

01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:22.649
I just have a few final words.

01:54:24.901 --> 01:54:26.277
Woodpecker.

01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:28.404
Gingivitis.

01:54:30.448 --> 01:54:31.824
Codswallop.

01:54:36.162 --> 01:54:38.122
<i>Do You Want to Build a Snowman?</i>

01:55:53.114 --> 01:55:54.282
Sorry I'm late.

01:55:54.365 --> 01:55:56.034
There was a bunch

01:55:56.117 --> 01:55:57.469
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

01:55:57.493 --> 01:55:58.703
No.
No.

01:55:59.787 --> 01:56:02.457
But I did have to help a kid.
Yeah.

01:56:02.915 --> 01:56:04.792
He's got a terrible name.
It's just awful.

01:56:04.876 --> 01:56:05.877
Ugh.
I tried to tell him.

01:56:08.212 --> 01:56:09.631
Is this heaven?

01:56:10.506 --> 01:56:11.716
It is now.

01:56:15.178 --> 01:56:17.055
I am so sorry.

01:56:17.889 --> 01:56:19.223
It's okay.

01:56:39.077 --> 01:56:40.953
I missed you so much.

01:56:46.542 --> 01:56:48.211
What is it? What's wrong?

01:56:50.129 --> 01:56:51.631
It's not time.

01:56:52.256 --> 01:56:54.133
What do you mean it's not time?

01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:55.802
I'm here, I made it.

01:56:55.968 --> 01:56:57.637
You can't stay.
No, no, no.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:00.348
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

01:57:00.431 --> 01:57:01.432
It's okay.

01:57:01.933 --> 01:57:04.769
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

01:57:05.770 --> 01:57:08.231
They need you.
Who?

01:57:10.274 --> 01:57:11.567
Your F-word.

01:57:12.819 --> 01:57:13.820
Why?

01:57:13.903 --> 01:57:14.904
You'll find out.

01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:17.699
It's all right. I'll be here.

01:57:19.075 --> 01:57:21.202
It's pretty fucking
awesome up here.

01:57:21.911 --> 01:57:23.746
I can have anything I want.

01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:25.957
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:27.417
It is heaven.

01:57:27.625 --> 01:57:28.876
I love you.

01:57:31.379 --> 01:57:34.132
I know. I love you, too.

01:57:34.716 --> 01:57:36.134
Now, go.

01:57:37.009 --> 01:57:39.011
Go on. Go, get out of here.

01:57:40.054 --> 01:57:41.055
Go.

01:57:43.850 --> 01:57:44.851
Hey!

01:57:47.854 --> 01:57:50.022
Kiss me like you miss me, Red.

01:57:50.648 --> 01:57:51.774
Well, come here.

01:58:11.127 --> 01:58:12.754
Don't fuck Elvis.

01:58:12.879 --> 01:58:14.630
Ooh, too late.
I'm sorry?

01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:25.349
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:58:25.433 --> 01:58:26.517
30 seconds.

01:58:26.601 --> 01:58:27.810
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

01:58:27.894 --> 01:58:30.354
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

01:58:30.438 --> 01:58:32.190
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

01:58:32.648 --> 01:58:33.941
Her name's Hope.

01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:35.359
Well...

01:58:36.194 --> 01:58:38.070
What are you doing?

01:58:38.154 --> 01:58:39.739
Somebody swiped right.

01:58:52.543 --> 01:58:54.921
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:58:58.257 --> 01:59:00.009
You sacrificed yourself for me.

01:59:00.092 --> 01:59:01.594
It would seem I...

01:59:03.763 --> 01:59:05.056
Huh?

01:59:06.182 --> 01:59:08.518
Genuine, high-grade lead.

01:59:10.436 --> 01:59:13.439
You time-sliding son of a bitch!

01:59:13.523 --> 01:59:15.107
You did this for me?

01:59:16.984 --> 01:59:19.487
Wait. You can't go back.

01:59:20.112 --> 01:59:21.364
You used the last of your fuel.

01:59:21.447 --> 01:59:23.157
What about your girl, your wife?

01:59:23.241 --> 01:59:26.494
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

01:59:27.954 --> 01:59:30.373
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

01:59:30.456 --> 01:59:31.666
and make sure the world

01:59:31.749 --> 01:59:33.459
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

01:59:34.168 --> 01:59:37.046
No. You did it for me.

01:59:37.797 --> 01:59:39.131
No, I didn't.

01:59:39.298 --> 01:59:40.675
You did.
I really didn't.

01:59:40.758 --> 01:59:42.598
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

01:59:42.635 --> 01:59:44.387
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:47.181
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

01:59:47.265 --> 01:59:49.684
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

01:59:50.101 --> 01:59:51.102
Say it again.

01:59:51.269 --> 01:59:52.812
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

01:59:52.895 --> 01:59:54.706
We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.

01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:56.607
These collars
don't just come off.

01:59:56.691 --> 01:59:57.692
Wade.

01:59:58.234 --> 01:59:59.861
I have an idea.

02:00:00.194 --> 02:00:02.280
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

02:00:02.363 --> 02:00:04.740
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

02:00:04.824 --> 02:00:07.952
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

02:00:08.035 --> 02:00:10.288
We need the code.

02:00:10.371 --> 02:00:12.248
Try, uh, seven?

02:00:12.331 --> 02:00:13.875
Settle down, Captain Lucky.

02:00:13.958 --> 02:00:15.376
It's not gonna be one number.

02:00:15.459 --> 02:00:16.619
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

02:00:17.545 --> 02:00:18.880
I still got it.

02:00:21.924 --> 02:00:23.885
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

02:00:25.595 --> 02:00:27.471
I don't know how to thank you.

02:00:27.555 --> 02:00:29.056
But I do know how to hug you.

02:00:29.515 --> 02:00:30.766
No.
Yes.

02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:32.310
Here we go. Bring it in.

02:00:32.393 --> 02:00:33.394
Come on.

02:00:33.519 --> 02:00:34.812
Pelvis to pelvis.

02:00:34.979 --> 02:00:36.230
Let's go tip to tip.

02:00:36.397 --> 02:00:38.900
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

02:00:40.651 --> 02:00:41.777
Is there a knife in my dick?

02:00:41.861 --> 02:00:44.089
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

02:00:44.113 --> 02:00:45.948
Yeah, yeah.
No need to go full <i>Yentl.</i>

02:00:46.032 --> 02:00:48.701
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

02:00:48.868 --> 02:00:50.786
Let's go home, Russell.

02:00:54.457 --> 02:00:56.208
All you dirty mutants

02:00:56.292 --> 02:00:58.711
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

02:00:58.878 --> 02:01:01.839
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

02:01:02.006 --> 02:01:03.257
Let's see your soul, perv!

02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:06.135
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

02:01:06.218 --> 02:01:07.386
We're better than him!

02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:10.139
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

02:01:10.222 --> 02:01:11.766
We'll let karma
take care of him.

02:01:11.849 --> 02:01:14.852
The day of reckoning is here!

02:01:24.195 --> 02:01:26.197
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

02:01:26.322 --> 02:01:27.490
Whoo!

02:01:27.573 --> 02:01:29.075
Courage, motherfuckers!

02:01:29.241 --> 02:01:30.493
And karma, motherfucker.

02:01:30.576 --> 02:01:32.179
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

02:01:32.203 --> 02:01:34.163
I could barely keep
a straight face.

02:01:34.246 --> 02:01:36.040
I want some more.

02:01:36.207 --> 02:01:37.875
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

02:01:37.959 --> 02:01:40.962
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

02:01:41.545 --> 02:01:43.673
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

02:01:43.839 --> 02:01:45.758
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

02:01:45.841 --> 02:01:47.134
Besides, we're X-Men.

02:01:47.426 --> 02:01:49.971
No, you're X-People.

02:01:50.137 --> 02:01:51.430
You're exhausting.

02:01:51.514 --> 02:01:53.182
I see what you did there.
Puns.

02:01:53.349 --> 02:01:54.725
Our door's always open.

02:01:54.809 --> 02:01:56.569
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

02:01:56.644 --> 02:01:57.645
Let alone two women.

02:01:58.771 --> 02:02:00.398
God, you're a douche.

02:02:00.523 --> 02:02:02.608
Bye, Wade!
Bye, Yukio!

02:02:05.361 --> 02:02:06.404
<i>What do you get</i>

02:02:06.487 --> 02:02:07.631
<i>when you take
eight feet of chrome...</i>

02:02:07.655 --> 02:02:08.781
<i>one pinch of courage...</i>

02:02:08.864 --> 02:02:10.074
<i>a cup of good luck...</i>

02:02:10.157 --> 02:02:11.659
<i>a dab of racism...</i>

02:02:11.742 --> 02:02:12.910
<i>a splash of diabetes...</i>

02:02:12.994 --> 02:02:15.329
<i>and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?</i>

02:02:15.746 --> 02:02:17.915
<i>Answer: a family.</i>

02:02:18.499 --> 02:02:21.585
<i>See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.</i>

02:02:21.669 --> 02:02:23.021
<i>If there's anything
you take away today...</i>

02:02:23.045 --> 02:02:26.173
<i>other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...</i>

02:02:26.257 --> 02:02:29.051
<i>it's that we all need
to belong to someone.</i>

02:04:26.127 --> 02:04:27.837
How something so small generates

02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:29.463
enough energy
to reverse time is...

02:04:29.547 --> 02:04:31.882
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

02:04:31.966 --> 02:04:34.218
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

02:04:34.301 --> 02:04:35.529
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

02:04:35.553 --> 02:04:36.554
Never heard of him.

02:04:36.637 --> 02:04:38.097
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:41.600
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

02:04:41.684 --> 02:04:43.936
don't I? A good day.

02:04:44.687 --> 02:04:45.688
Bye, Wade!

02:04:46.188 --> 02:04:47.189
Bye, Yukio!

02:04:48.524 --> 02:04:50.734
That was probably a bad idea.

02:04:51.068 --> 02:04:52.194
What have we done?

02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:12.631
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

02:05:22.808 --> 02:05:24.268
I'll be right back!

02:05:26.228 --> 02:05:28.772
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

02:05:29.148 --> 02:05:30.149
Whoo!

02:05:31.984 --> 02:05:33.235
Peter!

02:05:33.319 --> 02:05:34.862
Whoo! X-Force!

02:05:34.945 --> 02:05:37.156
Walk away! Just walk away!

02:05:38.032 --> 02:05:39.867
But we're X-Force!
Nope! We're not.

02:05:40.075 --> 02:05:41.410
X-Force is just a marketing tool

02:05:41.493 --> 02:05:42.745
designed by Fox executives...

02:05:42.828 --> 02:05:44.496
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

02:05:44.580 --> 02:05:45.873
It doesn't exist.

02:05:46.123 --> 02:05:49.335
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

02:05:49.501 --> 02:05:51.045
And I need to feed my cat!

02:05:51.212 --> 02:05:53.589
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

02:05:53.756 --> 02:05:57.009
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

02:06:06.185 --> 02:06:08.062
Wade, is that you?

02:06:10.314 --> 02:06:11.649
I guess Stryker finally

02:06:11.732 --> 02:06:13.108
figured out how to shut you up.

02:06:19.698 --> 02:06:22.952
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

02:06:23.118 --> 02:06:25.120
Just cleaning up the timelines!

02:06:25.204 --> 02:06:28.999
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

02:06:29.083 --> 02:06:31.335
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

02:06:31.710 --> 02:06:32.711
Huh?

02:06:32.795 --> 02:06:34.481
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

02:06:34.505 --> 02:06:36.465
to get back in the saddle again.

02:06:37.341 --> 02:06:39.885
And when he does, say yes.

02:06:41.136 --> 02:06:43.097
Oh, right.

02:06:44.014 --> 02:06:45.307
Love you!

02:06:47.685 --> 02:06:49.311
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

02:06:56.694 --> 02:06:58.529
You're welcome, Canada.

02:07:11.041 --> 02:07:12.209
Boy howdy.

02:07:14.086 --> 02:07:16.964
Hi. This is a toughie.

02:07:17.047 --> 02:07:18.048
Yeesh.

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:20.759
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

02:07:21.969 --> 02:07:24.763
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

02:07:24.847 --> 02:07:27.641
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

02:07:28.475 --> 02:07:30.060
Oh, I'm going to hell.

02:07:30.144 --> 02:07:31.729
That makes two of us.

02:07:31.895 --> 02:07:32.980
You can do this.

02:07:33.147 --> 02:07:36.150
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

02:07:36.233 --> 02:07:37.401
All right.

02:07:44.742 --> 02:07:46.660
Maximum effort.

02:13:24.831 --> 02:13:27.084
That's okay.
Let me see here.

02:13:27.167 --> 02:13:28.627
Oh, God.

02:13:28.710 --> 02:13:30.629
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

02:13:30.712 --> 02:13:32.631
No one's ever changed you.

02:13:33.131 --> 02:13:35.842
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

02:13:35.926 --> 02:13:38.387
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

02:13:38.762 --> 02:13:41.306
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:42.516
I think we both know

02:13:42.599 --> 02:13:43.785
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

02:13:43.809 --> 02:13:46.186
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

02:13:46.269 --> 02:13:48.206
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:49.564
He loves killing kids.
