<i>Look at the sonar.</i>

00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:08.417
<i>Let me know what you find.</i>

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:10.553
<i>So far nothing new, my friend.</i>

00:01:10.555 --> 00:01:12.356
<i>It just keeps getting worse.</i>

00:01:34.546 --> 00:01:37.946
D'Angelo, Marks, talk to me.

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:40.015
We've moved to the sonar room.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.952
Just nine rescues so far.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.753
<i>It's a mess, man.</i>

00:01:44.755 --> 00:01:46.657
<i>This is the worst
I've ever seen.</i>

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:48.359
Help!

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.594
Help!

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.929
Somebody help me!

00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.166
Help! Who's there?

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.304
I got one more survivor.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.872
Heading back
to the rescue vehicle now.

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:08.043
Marks. D'Angelo.

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.445
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:11.013
I have no idea.

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.882
Listen.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.662
<i>Jonas, we got
something outside the ship.</i>

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:27.932
<i>There's something out there.</i>

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:36.474
Here.

00:02:37.676 --> 00:02:38.774
You okay, pal?

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:45.582
Oh, my God.

00:02:45.584 --> 00:02:47.015
<i>Something's crushing the hull.</i>

00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:49.552
Get back to
the rescue vehicle. Now.

00:02:49.554 --> 00:02:50.921
We're right behind you.

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:54.756
You guys, move!

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.993
Got him. Slide him up.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:59.596
Marks. D'Angelo. Report.

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:00.996
You almost here?

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:03.165
<i>Jonas, listen to me.
We're trapped!</i>

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.099
What?

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:05.702
The impact jammed the hatch!

00:03:05.704 --> 00:03:06.904
Coming back.

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:10.739
<i>The sub is starting to collapse.</i>

00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:12.040
Marks!

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:13.041
<i>Jonas, we need you down here</i>

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:14.409
before it's too late.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.247
The sub's been breached.

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.549
<i>There's water everywhere.</i>

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:21.183
<i>Jonas, the room is flooding.</i>

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:23.986
<i>Marks, we gotta
get this hatch open.</i>

00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:25.555
<i>Come on, Jonas.
Where are you?</i>

00:03:25.557 --> 00:03:27.222
<i>- It's not gonna work!
- Let us out!</i>

00:03:27.224 --> 00:03:28.757
<i>Jonas, hurry, please!</i>

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.627
<i>We just need
more time! Don't leave us!</i>

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.629
<i>Jonas!</i>

00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:34.631
<i>Let us know when you're here!</i>

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.764
<i>Don't give up!</i>

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:37.165
<i>Jonas, please!</i>

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.400
<i>Come down here, now!
Where are you?</i>

00:03:38.402 --> 00:03:39.537
<i>Jonas!</i>

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.145
You've lost your mind!

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:50.112
Back off, Heller.

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:52.482
If we go back, everyone dies.

00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:53.951
Everyone.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.465
What have you done?

00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:43.925
Are we living the dream here
or what?

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.962
Welcome to <i>Mana One,</i>
Mr. Morris.

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:48.531
Get that thing away from me.

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:50.031
What are you doing?

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:53.870
Come on, bring it in.
There we go.

00:05:53.872 --> 00:05:55.370
Good to see you again,
Mr. Morris.

00:05:55.372 --> 00:05:56.972
- Yeah.
- This way, please.

00:05:56.974 --> 00:05:59.475
Hey, you always smell so nice.
What is that? Sandalwood?

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:02.043
It's impressive so far,
I'll say.

00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:03.412
Oh, here they are.

00:06:03.414 --> 00:06:05.113
Do you remember
my daughter Suyin?

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.549
Our chief marine biologist.

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:07.850
Hi.

00:06:18.996 --> 00:06:20.195
Sorry, what was that?

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:22.099
- I didn't catch it.
- Uh...

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:25.701
She says she likes your hat.

00:06:25.703 --> 00:06:27.437
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.506
Yeah.

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:34.544
- Let's go.
- Why don't we go? Yeah.

00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.183
Your granddaughter's a pistol.

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:41.185
Okay.

00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:43.655
What have we here?

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:47.956
This is, um,

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.325
really ugly.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.527
You know, I realize that

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:52.728
we're under construction
and everything,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.162
but I really think that

00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:56.097
a world-class research institute

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:59.000
deserves a world-class entrance.

00:06:59.002 --> 00:07:01.639
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

00:07:02.774 --> 00:07:04.339
<i>O-Level.</i>

00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:08.711
Whoa!

00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:10.913
Welcome to the O-Level.

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:13.315
Nice.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:15.150
This is our central hub,

00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:17.118
from which
researchers will access

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.090
all five labs
once it's finished.

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:22.594
Wow!

00:07:24.995 --> 00:07:26.698
Oh, look at that.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.168
That's not something
you see every day.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.474
Did you have
those whales here on cue?

00:07:38.476 --> 00:07:42.410
I might have lured them
with some whale songs.

00:07:42.412 --> 00:07:46.416
This is Lucy
and her daughter Gracie.

00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:49.150
Incredible.

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:52.788
Wow!

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.055
<i>Dive control level.</i>

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.390
- Here we are.
- Please.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:58.095
Follow me quickly.
I hope we are on time.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.562
Come on in.

00:07:59.564 --> 00:08:01.699
Oh.

00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:03.432
Oh, man.

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:05.100
I'd like you
to meet our engineer

00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:06.869
and sub designer, Jaxx.

00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:08.036
Hey, Doc.

00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:10.205
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:08:10.207 --> 00:08:12.808
Doctor Heller.
Our medical officer.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.209
Nice to meet you.

00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:15.578
You're like Bones, huh?

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.781
DJ here pilots
our remote explorer.

00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:19.982
How's it going?

00:08:19.984 --> 00:08:21.416
You're my first billionaire.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.185
And of course, Mac,
our station chief.

00:08:24.187 --> 00:08:25.788
Mr. Morris, just in time.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:26.856
So I keep hearing.

00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:28.356
Try that.

00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:29.625
Just in time for what?

00:08:29.627 --> 00:08:31.561
<i>Good morning,
Mr. Morris.</i>

00:08:31.563 --> 00:08:33.963
Lori Taylor, our mission pilot.

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:35.297
<i>Hi, Mr. Morris.</i>

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.298
Welcome on board.
It's good to have you.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.433
<i>Hey.</i>

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:38.701
How's it going down there?

00:08:38.703 --> 00:08:40.736
Where'd you learn
how to pilot a sub?

00:08:40.738 --> 00:08:42.772
<i>I spent ten years with a certain</i>

00:08:42.774 --> 00:08:44.574
whale-saving environmental group

00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:46.709
that shall remain unnamed
for legal reasons.

00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:48.511
Yeah, ask her
if she ever blew up

00:08:48.513 --> 00:08:50.046
a whaling ship
with a homemade torpedo.

00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:51.112
Hey.

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:52.247
No.

00:08:54.686 --> 00:08:56.284
That is a good hire.

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.787
<i>Eleven in two.</i>

00:08:57.789 --> 00:09:01.557
<i>Water temperature
is at six degrees.</i>

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:03.526
Mac, we are
through the thermocline.

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:05.595
We are approaching
11,000 meters.

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:08.265
One hundred meters
from the bottom.

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:10.398
<i>Maybe.</i>

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.300
<i>Maybe from the bottom.</i>

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:15.136
"Maybe"? What does
he mean, "maybe"?

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:17.172
Come on. Look at this.

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:18.841
Since 1875,

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:21.276
we've all believed
the Mariana Trench

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:22.945
was the deepest place on Earth.

00:09:22.947 --> 00:09:25.648
I've had a theory that
what we think is the bottom

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.383
might actually be a layer
of hydrogen sulfide.

00:09:28.385 --> 00:09:30.052
Beneath that cloud,

00:09:30.054 --> 00:09:31.621
and a freezing cold thermocline,

00:09:31.623 --> 00:09:33.923
there could be
a completely new world.

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:35.458
Wow!

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.158
The <i>Origin</i> is about to see
if my father is right.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.995
If there is warm water below,

00:09:38.997 --> 00:09:41.864
that means we're going to be
the first to see it.

00:09:41.866 --> 00:09:43.331
And what if you're wrong?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:47.003
Then you have wasted
$1.3 billion.

00:09:49.373 --> 00:09:50.575
You're kidding.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.810
He's kidding, right?

00:09:54.812 --> 00:09:56.078
Copy that.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.312
Wait. What?

00:09:57.314 --> 00:09:58.850
Ten meters.
Approaching boundary.

00:10:04.287 --> 00:10:06.187
Hovering at five meters.

00:10:06.189 --> 00:10:07.288
Full stop.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.591
Final checks.

00:10:08.593 --> 00:10:09.925
- Jaxx?
- Good to go.

00:10:09.927 --> 00:10:11.226
- Doc?
- Crew are go.

00:10:11.228 --> 00:10:13.462
- DJ?
- Sub and rover are a go.

00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:14.797
<i>Origin</i> crew,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:16.499
we are go for insertion.

00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.701
Insertion.

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:20.536
Is everything sexual
with you guys?

00:10:20.538 --> 00:10:22.938
Sex, food, power and...

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.272
Money.

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:27.143
Blow it up now.

00:10:27.145 --> 00:10:28.376
<i>Dive control,</i>

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:31.212
we are a go for... insertion.

00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:46.162
We're in.

00:10:46.164 --> 00:10:48.431
You guys, we're in.

00:10:48.433 --> 00:10:50.499
<i>It's a cloud.
It is not the bottom.</i>

00:10:50.501 --> 00:10:52.535
Lori, be careful.
We don't know the depth

00:10:52.537 --> 00:10:53.936
<i>on the other side of this.</i>

00:10:53.938 --> 00:10:55.438
<i>The sea floor could come
right up on you.</i>

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.809
<i>Copy that, Mac.
We're ready.</i>

00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:08.918
You guys, we are through!

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.721
<i>I have multiple
small sonar contacts.</i>

00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:13.556
<i>There is life down here.</i>

00:11:13.558 --> 00:11:14.892
<i>Congratulations!</i>

00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:17.595
Deploying the lights.

00:11:36.848 --> 00:11:38.950
Lights deployed.
I'm gonna come around.

00:11:53.431 --> 00:11:55.798
Whoa!

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.669
Oh, my goodness.

00:12:17.121 --> 00:12:18.623
- Wow!
- Whoa!

00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:20.956
Mac, tell me
you're getting this.

00:12:20.958 --> 00:12:22.725
We're getting all of it, Lori.

00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:25.596
Got a lot of
smiling faces up here.

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:32.770
DJ, we got positive terrain
to launch the rover.

00:12:33.336 --> 00:12:35.104
Copy.

00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:37.405
Launch is all yours.

00:12:37.407 --> 00:12:38.609
Okay.

00:12:39.844 --> 00:12:41.045
Rover is

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.081
free.

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:46.951
Copy.

<i>Water temperature</i>

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.759
<i>below three degrees Celsius.</i>

00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:04.936
How is this possible?

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.038
This ecosystem
is completely cut off

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.439
from the rest of the ocean

00:13:10.441 --> 00:13:12.441
by the freezing
cold thermocline.

00:13:12.443 --> 00:13:14.844
We should find
all sorts of species

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:16.846
completely unknown to science.

00:13:16.848 --> 00:13:19.750
Sounds like a good investment.

00:13:23.654 --> 00:13:25.420
Lori, I have a contact.

00:13:25.422 --> 00:13:27.558
Bearing zero eight zero.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.227
Huh. It's big.

00:13:31.229 --> 00:13:33.028
Oh, it's huge.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.364
And it's moving fast.

00:13:36.968 --> 00:13:39.070
DJ, is the rover seeing this?

00:13:40.938 --> 00:13:42.071
Negative.

00:13:42.073 --> 00:13:44.008
Let me try
and bring up some more lights.

00:13:50.281 --> 00:13:52.380
Rover One, <i>signal interrupted.</i>

00:13:52.382 --> 00:13:54.382
Whoa! I just lost telemetry.

00:13:54.384 --> 00:13:55.586
What the hell?

00:13:58.656 --> 00:14:00.055
<i>Origin,</i> recommend

00:14:00.057 --> 00:14:01.389
an immediate right turn
to three-five-zero.

00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:02.793
<i>This could be a landslide.</i>

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.702
Last time I checked,
landslides don't make

00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:15.504
<i>90-degree turns.</i>

00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:17.508
It's right on us!
It's right on us!

00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:23.812
What the hell was that?

00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:26.916
Lori, what's going on
down there?

00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:27.816
You guys...

00:14:27.818 --> 00:14:29.754
- What?
- Come look at this.

00:14:32.023 --> 00:14:33.022
Whoa!

00:14:33.024 --> 00:14:35.090
What could do that to the rover?

00:14:35.092 --> 00:14:37.293
I don't think I wanna know.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.431
It's coming back.

00:14:43.634 --> 00:14:44.934
Oh, my God!

00:14:44.936 --> 00:14:46.602
<i>Let's get out of here.
Blow the tanks.</i>

00:14:46.604 --> 00:14:47.870
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:49.538
<i>- It's not starting!
- Mac, help!</i>

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.073
- Whole system's down!
- Oh, my God.

00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:53.509
<i>Oh, my God. DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

00:14:53.511 --> 00:14:54.877
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:56.681
<i>Jonas was right! Do you co...</i>

00:15:00.184 --> 00:15:01.917
Lori, come in.

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:03.187
<i>Origin,</i> can you hear me?

00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:07.256
<i>Origin,</i> please respond.

00:15:07.258 --> 00:15:08.960
- Come on.
- Lori, come in.

00:15:12.263 --> 00:15:13.898
Wall, can you hear me?

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:18.469
Toshi?

00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:24.273
Gather around, people.
Options.

00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:25.374
Not great.

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:26.942
We know they're alive.

00:15:26.944 --> 00:15:29.411
I've still got telemetry
on their vitals.

00:15:29.413 --> 00:15:31.246
How long do they have?

00:15:31.248 --> 00:15:32.449
Maybe 18 hours.

00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:33.649
Ballast valves are jammed,

00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:35.150
which means
it can't rise by itself.

00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:36.285
If we attempt to tow it,

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:38.620
it's fifty-fifty
that the tanks will explode,

00:15:38.622 --> 00:15:40.055
and breach the capsule.

00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:42.124
- Can't we go hatch-to-hatch?
- Not a chance.

00:15:42.126 --> 00:15:44.727
The external camera's
showing severe hatch damage.

00:15:44.729 --> 00:15:46.228
We have to try something.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.796
They're six miles down

00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:49.965
and no one has ever attempted
a rescue at that depth.

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.535
Well, that's not exactly true.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.703
No. No way.

00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.038
We can handle this.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.706
Not at 11,000 meters, you can't.

00:15:57.708 --> 00:16:00.743
We've gone 5,000 meters.
8,000 meters.

00:16:00.745 --> 00:16:02.778
At some point,
it just becomes a number.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.346
Why don't you try this number?

00:16:04.348 --> 00:16:07.316
Three. That's how many people
have actually attempted

00:16:07.318 --> 00:16:09.218
a rescue below 10,000 meters.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.020
And the number one.

00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:12.688
That's how many are left alive
to talk about it.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.989
One man. Jonas Taylor.

00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:15.724
And look what happened
to that one man

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:17.259
the last time he went
to these depths.

00:16:17.261 --> 00:16:18.660
He saved eleven people,

00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:19.862
including you, Heller.
That's what happened.

00:16:19.864 --> 00:16:21.397
He left our friends to die,

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:23.699
because he had
pressure-induced psychosis.

00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:25.667
Come on, Heller.
That was your diagnosis.

00:16:25.669 --> 00:16:27.870
Jonas said
something attacked them.

00:16:27.872 --> 00:16:30.239
Something big enough to
take out a nuclear submarine.

00:16:30.241 --> 00:16:31.508
He's a drunk.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.975
You're not listening!
You're not listening!

00:16:32.977 --> 00:16:34.610
He washed up on a beach
in Thailand.

00:16:34.612 --> 00:16:36.078
- Did you hear what Lori said?
- I'm listening. I heard it.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.400
- Were you there?
- That's enough.

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:42.151
We all heard
Lori's last transmission.

00:16:42.153 --> 00:16:43.552
We have to consider

00:16:43.554 --> 00:16:44.987
that <i>Origin</i> may have encountered

00:16:44.989 --> 00:16:47.589
something similar to what
Jonas Taylor described.

00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:49.792
Something he was able
to escape from.

00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:51.994
<i>Ba!</i> Please.

00:16:52.997 --> 00:16:54.763
Prep the helicopter.

00:16:54.765 --> 00:16:57.001
We must go to Thailand.

00:17:33.003 --> 00:17:34.303
Your boat,

00:17:34.305 --> 00:17:36.138
she's killing me.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.340
Number one engine
slips out of the gear,

00:17:38.342 --> 00:17:39.842
and there's some leak
in the hydraulics.

00:17:39.844 --> 00:17:41.511
Hey, I'll take a look
at it tonight.

00:17:41.513 --> 00:17:42.744
That's what you said last night

00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:43.979
and the night before that,

00:17:43.981 --> 00:17:45.848
and the night before that.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.015
Hey, I'm working up to it.

00:17:47.017 --> 00:17:48.784
You drink too much.

00:17:48.786 --> 00:17:50.119
Hey, now you're only saying that

00:17:50.121 --> 00:17:53.122
because I literally have
a beer in my hand.

00:17:53.124 --> 00:17:55.824
You always have beer
in your hand.

00:17:55.826 --> 00:17:57.061
You know why?

00:17:57.962 --> 00:17:59.828
Because I drink too much?

00:18:22.621 --> 00:18:26.288
Now this is shaping up to be
an eventful Tuesday evening.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.591
You know
I like to make an entrance.

00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:29.958
Hell, Mac, after five years,

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.760
just showing up
is making an entrance.

00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:33.929
What? You're living
above a bar? Really?

00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:36.011
Figured it was the only way
to get you to come visit.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.336
Jonas, allow me to introduce...

00:18:41.338 --> 00:18:43.005
It's an honor to meet you,
Doctor Zhang.

00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:45.841
Always had a tremendous
respect for your work.

00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:47.276
You're too kind, Mr. Taylor.

00:18:47.278 --> 00:18:49.244
Yeah, no, I'm not.
You're a good man.

00:18:49.246 --> 00:18:51.780
Hey, can I offer
either of you two a beer?

00:18:51.782 --> 00:18:54.183
'Cause I'm gonna have a beer.

00:18:54.185 --> 00:18:56.118
It's not a social call, Jonas.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.254
You mean you didn't helicopter
in just to say "hi"?

00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:02.057
You wound me, Mac.

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:04.860
- We have a serious...
- Problem?

00:19:04.862 --> 00:19:06.596
Thought so.

00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:08.464
Just like you know

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:10.699
I don't dive anymore.

00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:11.934
Done being responsible
for people, Mac.

00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:13.235
Mr. Taylor...

00:19:13.237 --> 00:19:14.937
Hey, I mean no offense,
Doctor Zhang.

00:19:14.939 --> 00:19:17.005
I mean, if there was
two people on this planet

00:19:17.007 --> 00:19:18.807
that could get me
back into the water,

00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.842
it's probably you two.

00:19:20.844 --> 00:19:22.244
But you can't.

00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:25.448
You're gonna tell me your
problem, and I'll say no.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.316
You're gonna offer me money.

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:28.451
I'll still say no.

00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:31.053
You're gonna appeal
to my better nature,

00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:32.689
and I'm gonna say no.

00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:34.691
Because I don't have one.

00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:37.759
So I say, why don't we sit down?

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.394
We'll enjoy a couple of beers,

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:41.230
and then we can
get you on your way.

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:44.833
Jonas.

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:48.003
This happened this morning.

00:19:48.005 --> 00:19:50.272
<i>Let's get out
of here. Blow the tanks!</i>

00:19:50.274 --> 00:19:51.873
<i>I'm trying.
It's not working!</i>

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:53.208
<i>It's not starting!
Whole system's down!</i>

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.077
<i>Mac, help!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:57.879
<i>DJ, Mac.
There's something down here.</i>

00:19:57.881 --> 00:19:59.081
<i>Jonas was right.</i>

00:19:59.083 --> 00:20:00.382
<i>Jonas was right!
Do you co...</i>

00:20:01.453 --> 00:20:02.985
It's Lori.

00:20:02.987 --> 00:20:05.420
Your ex-wife
and her crew are trapped

00:20:05.422 --> 00:20:07.856
below 11,000 meters.

00:20:07.858 --> 00:20:09.258
I fear they may have encountered

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.661
the same species
you did down there.

00:20:11.663 --> 00:20:15.397
I have divers with less
experience willing to go.

00:20:15.399 --> 00:20:17.366
But I feel I owe it to my crew

00:20:17.368 --> 00:20:21.105
to give this rescue
the best chance of success.

00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:25.009
Please.

00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:35.019
Lori, hand me that hexa key.

00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:37.221
Thanks.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:42.924
Oh.

00:20:42.926 --> 00:20:45.260
Okay.

00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:46.696
Okay, if we can
short out the firewall,

00:20:46.698 --> 00:20:48.832
I can... I can probably
reboot the computers.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.837
Okay. Try it now.

00:20:58.643 --> 00:21:00.844
Auxiliary power's back.

00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:06.181
Heaters are online.

00:21:06.183 --> 00:21:07.717
There's no way that we'll
get the engine started,

00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:10.520
but we might be able
to get the ballast tanks back.

00:21:11.989 --> 00:21:13.589
What are you doing?
Taking notes?

00:21:13.591 --> 00:21:15.427
Letter to my wife.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.997
Just in case.

00:21:20.799 --> 00:21:21.997
Hey.

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:23.733
We got this.

00:21:23.735 --> 00:21:26.001
Step by step.

00:21:26.003 --> 00:21:29.006
Come on. Give me
that fighting octopus.

00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:40.717
See?

00:21:40.719 --> 00:21:42.252
Works every time.

00:21:48.793 --> 00:21:50.493
No.

00:21:50.495 --> 00:21:52.994
- What?
- We gotta can the lights.

00:22:13.217 --> 00:22:15.685
Turn out the lights.

00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:17.386
<i>There was
something down there with us.</i>

00:22:17.388 --> 00:22:18.588
<i>How can you be
sure if there were</i>

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.690
<i>no observation windows
on your craft?</i>

00:22:20.692 --> 00:22:22.391
<i>'Cause whatever it was</i>

00:22:22.393 --> 00:22:25.695
<i>caved in the entire starboard
side of a nuclear submarine.</i>

00:22:25.697 --> 00:22:27.195
<i>That wasn't my imagination.</i>

00:22:27.197 --> 00:22:29.465
<i>Is that why
you blew the hatch mid-rescue?</i>

00:22:29.467 --> 00:22:33.034
<i>Hey, look, I brought 11 men
back safe and sound.</i>

00:22:33.036 --> 00:22:34.637
<i>You left eight more to die</i>

00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:35.805
<i>because you panicked.</i>

00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:38.140
<i>If I hadn't blown the hatch,</i>

00:22:38.142 --> 00:22:40.308
<i>we all would have been
killed by that thing.</i>

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.611
<i>There was no thing.</i>

00:22:41.613 --> 00:22:43.111
<i>There was no evidence
of anything.</i>

00:22:43.113 --> 00:22:44.379
<i>Because it was destroyed</i>

00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:45.947
<i>in the explosion, Heller.</i>

00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:49.151
<i>Look, there was no time left!
So I made the call!</i>

00:22:49.153 --> 00:22:51.052
<i>And you left
our friends there to die</i>

00:22:51.054 --> 00:22:53.290
<i>in an act of cowardice!</i>

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.993
What do you think
happened down there?

00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.529
He lost it.

00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:01.296
And now we're about to send him

00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:03.433
into the exact same situation.

00:23:04.903 --> 00:23:06.234
Excuse me, Suyin.

00:23:06.236 --> 00:23:08.203
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but we need you.

00:23:08.205 --> 00:23:09.674
It's an emergency.

00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:12.941
What's wrong, Jaxx?

00:23:12.943 --> 00:23:14.309
Now they're leaking oxygen.

00:23:14.311 --> 00:23:16.180
They've got a couple of hours.
Maybe more.

00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:19.615
- I'm going.
- No.

00:23:19.617 --> 00:23:20.817
Wait, what?

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:22.752
I'll take one of the gliders,
grab the <i>Origin,</i>

00:23:22.754 --> 00:23:24.419
- and tow her up.
- Wait!

00:23:24.421 --> 00:23:26.702
If the <i>Origin's</i> ballast tanks
blow, you're gonna die, too.

00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:29.193
We have to try.

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:33.731
Mummy?

00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:38.166
Meiying.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.508
Um...

00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:55.352
Uh...

00:24:16.574 --> 00:24:18.208
Communications check!

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:23.178
Good to go.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.649
Suyin, you are go for launch.

00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:28.051
Richard Byrd.

00:24:49.607 --> 00:24:52.376
<i>Auto descent sequence initiated.</i>

00:24:54.979 --> 00:24:57.147
- Hey, Meiying.
- Hi.

00:25:26.477 --> 00:25:29.344
- Sir, we've got a new problem.
- It's your daughter.

00:25:29.346 --> 00:25:31.413
She took a glider
to try and save them.

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:32.748
Why did you let her go?

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.216
Trust me,
I didn't let her do anything.

00:25:35.218 --> 00:25:36.652
I was sort of
under the impression

00:25:36.654 --> 00:25:38.219
you're supposed to try
to save people

00:25:38.221 --> 00:25:39.087
who are dying
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:25:39.089 --> 00:25:40.355
Who's he?

00:25:40.357 --> 00:25:42.326
I'm the guy
who paid for all this.

00:25:43.528 --> 00:25:44.894
Uh-huh.

00:25:44.896 --> 00:25:47.262
You know, he looks heroic
and he walks fast,

00:25:47.264 --> 00:25:50.367
but he's kind of
got a negative attitude.

00:25:54.072 --> 00:25:55.337
What's the window?

00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:57.240
It'll be close.

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:00.375
Who are you?

00:26:00.377 --> 00:26:01.611
I'm the one
that designed all this.

00:26:01.613 --> 00:26:03.479
So my life's in your hands?

00:26:03.481 --> 00:26:06.616
Pretty much. That a problem?

00:26:06.618 --> 00:26:07.550
Nah.

00:26:07.552 --> 00:26:08.751
You look like you might

00:26:08.753 --> 00:26:10.753
actually know what you're doing.

00:26:10.755 --> 00:26:12.955
<i>Dive control level.</i>

00:26:12.957 --> 00:26:14.490
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:26:14.492 --> 00:26:17.893
Mac, have Doctor Heller
meet us in the medical bay.

00:26:17.895 --> 00:26:19.095
Heller?

00:26:19.097 --> 00:26:21.129
Did I not mention that?

00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:22.567
You mother...

00:26:27.505 --> 00:26:28.871
He's in perfect shape.

00:26:28.873 --> 00:26:30.808
Just like the last time
you examined me.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.511
Suyin took a glider
15 minutes ago.

00:26:35.513 --> 00:26:37.145
She's planning
on taking the <i>Origin</i> back up.

00:26:37.147 --> 00:26:38.447
Take me to the sub.

00:26:38.449 --> 00:26:40.516
- We're not done here.
- Yeah, we are.

00:26:40.518 --> 00:26:41.751
Lori's running out of air,

00:26:41.753 --> 00:26:43.251
and we're in
international waters,

00:26:43.253 --> 00:26:44.587
which means legally

00:26:44.589 --> 00:26:46.421
I can beat the ever-loving
shit out of you

00:26:46.423 --> 00:26:48.358
and get away with it.

00:26:49.794 --> 00:26:51.226
It's true.

00:26:51.228 --> 00:26:52.463
Legally, I mean.

00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:55.800
Good thing
he doesn't hold a grudge.

00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:57.867
Jonas, you do know

00:26:57.869 --> 00:26:59.669
that this sub is rated
for 12,000 meters, right?

00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:01.837
Like the one leaking
on the ocean floor?

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:04.106
Ah. Good point.

00:27:04.108 --> 00:27:05.641
- We good?
- Yep.

00:27:05.643 --> 00:27:07.109
Once you strip back the safeties

00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:09.679
and go full manual,
like I know you're gonna do,

00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:11.080
the system's gonna have problems

00:27:11.082 --> 00:27:13.582
trying to keep up
with your pressure changes.

00:27:13.584 --> 00:27:15.283
Try not to blow
your ears out, brother.

00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.354
Thanks, mate.

00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:33.268
Hello, skipper.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.205
You must be the crazy guy.

00:27:36.007 --> 00:27:37.840
Now who called me that?

00:27:37.842 --> 00:27:39.644
My mom. Doctor Heller.

00:27:40.645 --> 00:27:43.311
Yeah, well, I'm not crazy.

00:27:43.313 --> 00:27:45.548
I've just seen things
no one else has.

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:48.184
That's the definition of crazy.

00:27:50.988 --> 00:27:54.224
Backup power. Backup power...

00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:00.730
So where are your parents?

00:28:00.732 --> 00:28:03.466
My mom's trying
to bring our friends back

00:28:03.468 --> 00:28:05.768
from the bottom of the ocean.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.772
My dad's with a Pilates
instructor in Taipei.

00:28:09.774 --> 00:28:12.541
Granddad says
Mom needs to move on,

00:28:12.543 --> 00:28:14.443
but Mom says
she needs some more time

00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:16.512
because she was
married to an a-hole.

00:28:16.514 --> 00:28:18.516
Sounds like
your mom's got a point.

00:28:22.954 --> 00:28:24.720
You know a lot.

00:28:24.722 --> 00:28:27.257
Eight-year-olds hear everything.

00:28:28.993 --> 00:28:30.962
Mind if I give it a try?

00:28:33.363 --> 00:28:35.332
Bye.

00:28:40.337 --> 00:28:41.572
Hey, Crazy.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.875
Is my mom gonna die?

00:28:45.877 --> 00:28:49.178
I'll have <i>Captain Bubbles</i>
and your mom back in no time.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.281
I promise.

00:28:56.286 --> 00:28:57.887
Thank you, Emma.

<i>Caution.</i> Evolution

00:30:13.598 --> 00:30:16.131
How is he descending so fast?

00:30:16.133 --> 00:30:18.601
Looks like he's diverted
all nonessential power

00:30:18.603 --> 00:30:20.603
like heat and life support
to the motors.

00:30:20.605 --> 00:30:22.004
He's gonna black out.

00:30:25.176 --> 00:30:27.144
His blood gases are dropping.

00:30:29.213 --> 00:30:30.546
Jonas.

00:30:30.548 --> 00:30:32.049
<i>Tell Heller
I'm not slowing down.</i>

00:30:42.426 --> 00:30:43.559
<i>Suyin, be advised.</i>

Evolution <i>is now en route.</i>

00:30:44.896 --> 00:30:46.528
Request you return

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.763
<i>Negative.</i>

00:30:47.765 --> 00:30:49.632
He can give us
an escort on our way up.

00:30:49.634 --> 00:30:51.600
Tell her to get
out of the way, Mac.

00:30:51.602 --> 00:30:53.035
More people means more risk

00:30:53.037 --> 00:30:54.470
<i>and she's in way over her head.</i>

00:30:54.472 --> 00:30:56.908
Jonas, you just
told her yourself.

00:30:58.408 --> 00:30:59.708
What?

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.143
The little green button
on your intercom,

00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:03.114
that's for single channel
communication.

00:31:04.048 --> 00:31:05.816

00:31:56.534 --> 00:31:57.967
I can't tell.

00:31:57.969 --> 00:31:59.837
I can't see anything right now.

00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:35.637
Oh.

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:37.906
There it is.

00:32:37.908 --> 00:32:39.375
I've got visual on the <i>Origin.</i>

00:32:39.377 --> 00:32:40.542
<i>I can see most of it.</i>

00:32:40.544 --> 00:32:42.378
Okay. They're alive.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.948

<i>Suyin, what's happening?</i>

00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:40.235
It's a huge squid.

00:33:40.237 --> 00:33:41.670
It's got the glider.

00:33:41.672 --> 00:33:43.238
<i>Warning.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.241
<i>Mac, it's crushing me.
It's crushing me!</i>

00:33:46.243 --> 00:33:47.910
<i>I don't think
the glider can take it.</i>

00:33:47.912 --> 00:33:49.180
It's not gonna hold.

00:33:51.816 --> 00:33:54.783
<i>Suyin, engage

<i>It's like 20, 25 meters.</i>

00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:33.222

Suyin, power down.

00:34:46.303 --> 00:34:47.736
It's drawn to the light.

00:34:47.738 --> 00:34:50.005

00:35:13.264 --> 00:35:14.796
<i>eight, seven,</i>

00:35:14.798 --> 00:35:17.134
<i>six, five...</i>

00:35:37.021 --> 00:35:38.687
Now's your chance.
Blow your tanks.

00:35:38.689 --> 00:35:41.256
No. I can help you
save the crew.

00:35:41.258 --> 00:35:43.959
<i>Your glider's damaged.
There's nothing you can do.</i>

00:35:43.961 --> 00:35:45.963
Blow your tanks now.

00:35:46.797 --> 00:35:48.132
Damn it.

00:35:55.406 --> 00:35:56.772
<i>Doctor Zhang,</i>

00:35:56.774 --> 00:35:58.474
<i>your daughter's clear.</i>

00:35:58.476 --> 00:36:01.378
<i>I'm heading for the</i> Origin <i>now.</i>

00:36:07.318 --> 00:36:09.820
<i>Range to target: three meters.</i>

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.198
<i>Water extraction complete.</i>

00:36:30.174 --> 00:36:32.510
Let's do this, sweetheart.

00:36:54.064 --> 00:36:57.001
Tell me this isn't the world's
best "I told you so."

00:36:57.736 --> 00:36:58.967
You came all the way here

00:36:58.969 --> 00:37:00.302
just to tell me that,
didn't you?

00:37:00.304 --> 00:37:02.271
Pretty much.

00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:04.542
Give me your hand.

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:11.648
Ah, that doesn't look good.
Ready? One, two, three.

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:16.486
She's coming.

00:37:16.488 --> 00:37:18.820
Let's move.

00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:21.491
If that thing hits us
while we're still attached...

00:37:21.493 --> 00:37:23.360
Then we're all gonna die.

00:37:30.702 --> 00:37:31.969
Come on, I've got you.

00:37:33.037 --> 00:37:34.604
It's gonna be close.

00:37:34.606 --> 00:37:36.340
Come on, move, move!

00:37:38.543 --> 00:37:40.208
Go! Go! Go!

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.512
We're not gonna make it.

00:37:42.514 --> 00:37:44.449
- Come on.
- Toshi, hurry!

00:37:45.583 --> 00:37:46.850
Toshi, no!

00:38:17.047 --> 00:38:18.349
<i>Come in,</i> Evolution.

00:38:19.718 --> 00:38:21.619
<i>Jonas, come in.</i>

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.289
<i>Are you all okay?</i>

00:38:28.192 --> 00:38:30.560
<i>Doctor Heller has vitals
on Lori and The Wall,</i>

00:38:30.562 --> 00:38:32.597
<i>but we don't have Toshi.</i>

00:38:33.397 --> 00:38:34.566
<i>Is Toshi okay?</i>

00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:38.402
<i>Jonas, is Toshi okay?</i>

00:38:39.738 --> 00:38:41.103
- All right.
- Nice and easy.

00:38:41.105 --> 00:38:42.572
Yeah. Yep.

00:38:42.574 --> 00:38:44.106
- Don't move her neck.
- Careful.

00:38:44.108 --> 00:38:47.077
That's good.
Grab a hold. We got her.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.922
You couldn't bring Toshi back?

00:39:00.924 --> 00:39:03.661
- Why not?
- He closed the hatch.

00:39:05.497 --> 00:39:06.997
He saved us.

00:39:08.031 --> 00:39:09.634
You left him.

00:39:12.002 --> 00:39:14.470
You left him
because that's who you are.

00:39:14.472 --> 00:39:16.905
You are the guy
who leaves people behind.

00:39:16.907 --> 00:39:18.574
You go that deep,

00:39:18.576 --> 00:39:20.443
you take your life
in your hands.

00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:23.347
It was your choice
to send them down.

00:39:27.752 --> 00:39:30.588
This is why
I don't do this anymore, Mac.

00:39:42.834 --> 00:39:44.034
How is she?

00:39:46.671 --> 00:39:48.937
Well, the puncture
just missed her liver.

00:39:48.939 --> 00:39:50.573
She lost a lot of blood.

00:39:50.575 --> 00:39:52.109
But she's stable.

00:39:59.884 --> 00:40:01.084
Jonas.

00:40:04.054 --> 00:40:05.490
I'm sorry.

00:40:06.591 --> 00:40:08.192
I was wrong.

00:40:10.795 --> 00:40:12.329
You save Lori,

00:40:13.297 --> 00:40:15.098
we can call it even.

00:40:42.326 --> 00:40:44.660
I just want to apologize
for before.

00:40:44.662 --> 00:40:47.062
I was angry
and I lose my temper.

00:40:47.064 --> 00:40:48.533
And you did save my...

00:40:50.635 --> 00:40:51.636
You're naked.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.144
I know you did all you could.
So, thank you.

00:41:01.779 --> 00:41:03.245
Yeah.

00:41:03.247 --> 00:41:05.481
You're welcome.

00:41:05.483 --> 00:41:09.186
I know it's not easy
being the person who survives.

00:41:11.054 --> 00:41:12.922
I'm gonna go now.

00:41:12.924 --> 00:41:14.055
You should put on some clothes.

00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:16.358
Yep. That's the original plan.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.496
Okay, then. Carry on.

00:41:38.348 --> 00:41:41.149
Hi. Uh... I was...

00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:42.554
It's all good.

00:41:44.221 --> 00:41:46.856
Jonas and Lori were the worst
married couple ever, you know?

00:41:46.858 --> 00:41:48.056
Uh-huh.

00:41:48.058 --> 00:41:50.327
Whole experiment
was over in a year.

00:41:51.729 --> 00:41:53.598
I didn't ask anything.

00:41:54.566 --> 00:41:56.233
I know.

00:42:01.673 --> 00:42:05.106
This is what
attacked us. A megalodon.

00:42:05.108 --> 00:42:07.275
How big is that thing?

00:42:07.277 --> 00:42:11.413
Between 70 and 90 feet.
21 to 27 meters.

00:42:11.415 --> 00:42:15.317
The megalodon was the largest
shark that ever existed.

00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:17.218
It feared nothing.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.855
It had no predators.

00:42:19.857 --> 00:42:23.358
Its jaws were stronger
than any other animal, ever.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.227
The meg could bite
a whale in half,

00:42:26.229 --> 00:42:27.997
crushing through the bones.

00:42:27.999 --> 00:42:30.032
We are in uncharted territory.

00:42:30.034 --> 00:42:31.434
Until today

00:42:31.436 --> 00:42:33.836
megalodons were thought
to have been extinct

00:42:33.838 --> 00:42:35.403
for over two million years.

00:42:35.405 --> 00:42:37.740
- Wrong.
- A living fossil.

00:42:37.742 --> 00:42:40.712
That living fossil
ate my friend.

00:42:42.412 --> 00:42:44.279
I cannot begin to express

00:42:44.281 --> 00:42:46.147
my sadness for Toshi's death.

00:42:46.149 --> 00:42:48.216
We have the discovery
of a lifetime.

00:42:48.218 --> 00:42:50.688
This is what Toshi worked for.

00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:54.356
It's what we've all worked for.

00:42:54.358 --> 00:42:57.860
But we're going
to have to proceed slowly.

00:42:57.862 --> 00:43:00.665
Yeah, that's really
not gonna work for me.

00:43:03.266 --> 00:43:05.436
What is <i>Mana One?</i>

00:43:06.169 --> 00:43:07.470
This station?

00:43:07.472 --> 00:43:09.440
Yes. And what's it doing?

00:43:10.307 --> 00:43:12.376
Hmm? Right now.

00:43:14.746 --> 00:43:16.045
Exactly.

00:43:16.047 --> 00:43:18.047
Nothing.

00:43:18.049 --> 00:43:19.649
20 million dollar rover, gone.

00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:22.518
Thirty million dollar sub, gone.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520
You are now sitting
in the most expensive

00:43:24.522 --> 00:43:27.255
underwater marine
biology day camp

00:43:27.257 --> 00:43:29.058
in human history.

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.326
Hey, Crazy.

00:43:31.328 --> 00:43:32.762
And now that we've actually

00:43:32.764 --> 00:43:34.364
found something amazing,

00:43:35.133 --> 00:43:37.365
we can't proceed slowly.

00:43:37.367 --> 00:43:40.536
Thank you
for keeping your promise.

00:43:40.538 --> 00:43:42.138
- You're welcome.
- You don't quit

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.406
trying to get to the Moon
because you lose an astronaut.

00:43:44.408 --> 00:43:45.841
You charge forward,

00:43:45.843 --> 00:43:48.911
or someone else
will get there first.

00:43:48.913 --> 00:43:52.116
Other people will want
a piece of this thing,

00:43:52.215 --> 00:43:54.617
whether we like it or not.

00:43:54.619 --> 00:43:56.286
You seem to like it.

00:43:57.689 --> 00:44:01.724
- Excuse me?
- I said, you seem to like it.

00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:04.292
I'm sorry.
Is he part of this team?

00:44:04.294 --> 00:44:06.696
You're damn right
he's a part of this team.

00:44:06.698 --> 00:44:08.564
Okay.

00:44:08.566 --> 00:44:10.032
You ever think
that Mother Nature

00:44:10.034 --> 00:44:12.601
might know what she's doing?

00:44:12.603 --> 00:44:17.506
The thermocline might
just be there for a reason?

00:44:17.508 --> 00:44:22.277
Hey, look, you wanna explore?
Go ahead, explore.

00:44:22.279 --> 00:44:25.380
But if you start sending
people back down there,

00:44:25.382 --> 00:44:27.917
don't call me
to come save your asses.

00:44:27.919 --> 00:44:29.518
Because in case what happened
down there

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.487
wasn't clear to you,

00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:34.422
man vs. meg isn't a fight.

00:44:34.424 --> 00:44:35.727
It's a slaughter.

00:44:50.373 --> 00:44:52.541
<i>O-Level.</i>

00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:34.917
What you people discovered
is an even bigger goldmine

00:45:34.919 --> 00:45:37.186
than we ever thought possible.

00:45:37.188 --> 00:45:38.954
We are completely unprepared

00:45:38.956 --> 00:45:40.656
to deal with creatures
like megalodon.

00:45:40.658 --> 00:45:42.323
I understand,
and we can get prepared.

00:45:42.325 --> 00:45:44.226
I'm talking about
a long-term plan.

00:46:38.015 --> 00:46:39.784
That's gonna be
the other alternative.

00:46:42.352 --> 00:46:43.654
What's that?

00:46:47.992 --> 00:46:49.093
My daughter.

00:46:58.569 --> 00:47:00.002
Jonas.

00:47:00.004 --> 00:47:01.270
- Did you see Meiying?
- We can't find Meiying.

00:47:01.272 --> 00:47:04.006
Meiying? Meiying?

00:47:04.008 --> 00:47:05.688
- I'll take this way.
- Let's try this way.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.451
Meiying.

00:47:14.018 --> 00:47:15.019
Meiying?

00:47:16.721 --> 00:47:18.589
- Meiying.
- Mama.

00:47:21.058 --> 00:47:23.058
Are you okay?

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.196
There's a monster
and it's watching us.

00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:48.719
It's okay.
It's just a whale.

00:47:49.887 --> 00:47:51.622
Wait. Where's Lucy?

00:47:53.124 --> 00:47:55.257
Where's the mom?

00:48:07.939 --> 00:48:10.873
Is the station all right?
Report.

00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:12.574
No leaks. No visible damage.

00:48:12.576 --> 00:48:15.477
All right, team.
Initiate emergency protocols.

00:48:15.479 --> 00:48:16.946
And nobody is to go
near the water.

00:48:16.948 --> 00:48:17.947
If you insist.

00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:19.782
Turn off
all the underwater lighting.

00:48:19.784 --> 00:48:21.817
Restrict the crew
to essential areas.

00:48:21.819 --> 00:48:24.453
You said it was impossible
for it to get up here.

00:48:24.455 --> 00:48:26.021
It should have been.

00:48:26.023 --> 00:48:27.823
You guys, take a look at this.

00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:30.159
When the glider came up,
the thermocline was intact,

00:48:30.161 --> 00:48:32.294
so it was
one degree Celsius, right?

00:48:32.296 --> 00:48:33.829
Yeah.

00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:35.998
But a minute later,
when the <i>Evolution</i> came up,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.100
the temperature increased
by 25 degrees.

00:48:38.102 --> 00:48:40.469
A shark could come
right through there.

00:48:40.471 --> 00:48:42.705
20 sharks for that matter.

00:48:42.707 --> 00:48:43.906
When the meg hit the <i>Origin,</i>

00:48:43.908 --> 00:48:45.374
it slammed into a thermal vent.

00:48:45.376 --> 00:48:47.943
Those can release millions
of gallons per minute.

00:48:47.945 --> 00:48:50.012
The heat from that vent
cleared the path

00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:51.747
through the freezing cold layer.

00:48:51.749 --> 00:48:52.948
Are you saying we opened up

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:54.451
a super highway
for giant sharks?

00:48:54.453 --> 00:48:57.619
Not exactly. It seems like
it was a transitory event.

00:48:57.621 --> 00:48:58.854
The temperatures
are returned to normal

00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:00.489
and the gap is closed.

00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:03.659
Yeah. But not before a massive
prehistoric killing machine

00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:05.160
decided to come up
and say "Hi."

00:49:05.162 --> 00:49:07.563
Hey, look, we're wasting time.
That thing's out there.

00:49:07.565 --> 00:49:09.033
We need to find it and kill it.

00:49:09.468 --> 00:49:10.966
No.

00:49:10.968 --> 00:49:15.438
We can't. We should explore
non-lethal options first.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.206
For the meg or for us?

00:49:18.943 --> 00:49:20.142
<i>Attention.</i>

00:49:20.144 --> 00:49:22.511
I've got
an emergency locator beacon.

00:49:22.513 --> 00:49:24.179
20 miles south, southwest.

00:49:24.181 --> 00:49:25.381
What does that mean?

00:49:25.383 --> 00:49:26.882
It means a boat has gone down.

00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:28.717
- <i>Attention.</i>
- Three boats.

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:32.623
That's the meg.
We need to get there. Now.

00:49:47.538 --> 00:49:50.174
Mac! I found something!

00:50:08.626 --> 00:50:10.460
These sharks have no fins.

00:50:10.462 --> 00:50:12.928
They were killed
by shark poachers.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:15.800
They cut off the fins and
throw the shark back to die.

00:50:16.867 --> 00:50:19.635
All for a bowl of soup.

00:50:19.637 --> 00:50:21.305
Looks like the meg
evened the score.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.045
One fish did all this?

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.781
Ask it yourself.

00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:35.050
Okay.

00:50:35.052 --> 00:50:37.686
We have a shark cage
and spearguns on board.

00:50:37.688 --> 00:50:39.321
If we can shoot the meg

00:50:39.323 --> 00:50:41.090
in a soft spot
like it's mouth or gills,

00:50:41.092 --> 00:50:43.192
we can inject it
with something lethal.

00:50:43.194 --> 00:50:44.461
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

00:50:44.463 --> 00:50:46.195
It's gonna take at least
20 minutes to rig the cage.

00:50:46.197 --> 00:50:47.896
And that thing
will be gone in two.

00:50:47.898 --> 00:50:49.633
Why don't you just
put a tracker on it?

00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:53.635
Don't you guys
ever watch <i>Shark Week?</i>

00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:58.441
You have one of those, like,
GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.

00:50:58.443 --> 00:51:00.409
Keep an eye on the shark
till the cage is ready.

00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:02.377
We should be able
to put a tracking dart

00:51:02.379 --> 00:51:03.513
in that dorsal fin.

00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:04.613
You're welcome.

00:51:04.615 --> 00:51:06.248
Yeah, but somehow

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:07.816
we have to get this boat
next to that meg.

00:51:07.818 --> 00:51:09.486
No, we can't.

00:51:09.488 --> 00:51:12.221
It's already proven
aggressive towards boats.

00:51:12.223 --> 00:51:14.557
The safest way to approach
is without a vehicle.

00:51:14.559 --> 00:51:15.724
Hold up. Hold up.

00:51:15.726 --> 00:51:17.226
You want someone
to swim out there?

00:51:17.228 --> 00:51:19.895
To a prehistoric shark
that ate our friend?

00:51:19.897 --> 00:51:22.364
Actually, one of us alone
in the water is no threat.

00:51:22.366 --> 00:51:25.002
Okay, who the hell
is gonna make that swim?

00:51:27.204 --> 00:51:28.438
Let's draw straws.

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.007
I can't swim.

00:51:32.643 --> 00:51:33.876
Uh...

00:51:33.878 --> 00:51:36.947
Sorry, my body made me say that.

00:51:38.282 --> 00:51:40.217
You sure about this?

00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:45.420
Not really.

00:51:45.422 --> 00:51:48.125
If I get eaten,
you're gonna feel really bad.

00:51:54.098 --> 00:51:57.368
This tracker rifle
only has a 100-foot range.

00:51:58.102 --> 00:51:59.234
100 feet?

00:51:59.236 --> 00:52:01.138
Get really close
before you shoot.

00:52:02.139 --> 00:52:03.705
Great.

00:52:03.707 --> 00:52:05.807
If you want me
to go instead, I will.

00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:07.644
I got this, Mac.

00:52:07.646 --> 00:52:09.445
Okay, good, 'cause I was lying.

00:52:09.447 --> 00:52:10.746
Be safe.

00:52:10.748 --> 00:52:12.249
Yeah, thanks, pal.

00:52:15.319 --> 00:52:17.288
I hope you're right about this.

00:52:18.222 --> 00:52:19.457
Me, too.

00:52:31.436 --> 00:52:33.137
I'm an idiot.

00:52:44.982 --> 00:52:48.651
I am proceeding to
the enormous killer shark.

00:52:48.653 --> 00:52:50.419
Yeah, we got you, Jonas.

00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:53.456
<i>Sharks are
attracted to panic motion.</i>

00:52:53.458 --> 00:52:55.259
<i>Keep it nice and smooth.</i>

00:53:05.604 --> 00:53:07.472
It's all gonna be fine.

00:53:13.877 --> 00:53:16.144
<i>♪ Just keep swimming</i>

00:53:16.146 --> 00:53:18.747

00:53:18.749 --> 00:53:21.116
<i>♪ Swimming, swimming</i>

00:53:21.118 --> 00:53:23.254
<i>♪ Just keep swimming</i>

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.962
Oh, boy, it's going under.

00:54:31.456 --> 00:54:32.655
He's done it.

00:54:32.657 --> 00:54:34.289
Mac, tracker is live!

00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:35.560
Great!
Reel him in, DJ.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.666
Stop! Stop!

00:54:43.668 --> 00:54:45.437
No vibration!

00:54:47.237 --> 00:54:49.806
Oh, shit. I'm in trouble.

00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:51.173
Jonas, it's coming at you.

00:54:51.175 --> 00:54:53.810
You think I didn't notice?

00:54:53.812 --> 00:54:55.279
Start the boat!
Start the boat!

00:55:01.553 --> 00:55:03.320
Pull him in.

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.606
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on!

00:55:40.124 --> 00:55:42.224
You might be a son of a bitch,

00:55:42.226 --> 00:55:44.094
but you're sure as hell
no coward.

00:55:44.562 --> 00:55:45.894
Good job.

00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:05.080
I prepared the spearheads
to inject etorphine.

00:56:05.082 --> 00:56:07.949
A killer whale is knocked
out with 10 CCs.

00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:10.586
Dead with 20.
What do you think?

00:56:10.588 --> 00:56:13.323
I think we use
the whole damn bottle.

00:56:14.726 --> 00:56:17.993
Remind me again
why this is a good idea.

00:56:17.995 --> 00:56:20.262
What?
It's a shark cage.

00:56:20.264 --> 00:56:22.264
Plastic shark cage.

00:56:22.266 --> 00:56:24.734
I'm gonna ignore
that you just said that.

00:56:24.736 --> 00:56:27.169
This beautiful thing
is polycarbonate,

00:56:27.171 --> 00:56:29.806
specifically designed
not to crack,

00:56:29.808 --> 00:56:32.340
not to break, but to deform.

00:56:32.342 --> 00:56:34.309
And in this case,
at this thickness,

00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:38.180
it would take 20,000 pounds
per square inch.

00:56:38.182 --> 00:56:40.182
And if you're talking
about breaking,

00:56:40.184 --> 00:56:42.720
that's eight to nine
hundred thousand.

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:47.592
I don't like it.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.596
Doesn't like it.

00:56:53.598 --> 00:56:55.299
I wouldn't get in there.

00:56:57.134 --> 00:56:58.368
Keep it coming.

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.107
That's good!

00:57:11.716 --> 00:57:12.750
Hey.

00:57:13.785 --> 00:57:16.084
What did he say?

00:57:16.086 --> 00:57:17.920
He said, "be careful."

00:57:17.922 --> 00:57:20.222
That's his version
of I love you.

00:57:20.224 --> 00:57:22.023
Your father has
a lot of faith in you.

00:57:22.025 --> 00:57:25.195
I've done
hundreds of shark dives.

00:57:26.831 --> 00:57:28.999
Not like this.

00:57:29.534 --> 00:57:30.668
Yes.

00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:33.401
But I know shark anatomy.

00:57:33.403 --> 00:57:35.036
And I know where this

00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:37.709
can penetrate through
megalodon skin.

00:57:40.277 --> 00:57:42.812
- Suyin, let me go instead...
- Hey.

00:57:42.814 --> 00:57:45.750
Don't worry about me.
Let me do what I do best.

00:58:32.195 --> 00:58:33.763
<i>Everything okay up there?</i>

00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:36.398
<i>Just a fresh round of chum,</i>

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.401
so you, you know, taste good.

00:58:39.403 --> 00:58:42.070
<i>I'm so glad
you're looking out for me.</i>

00:58:42.072 --> 00:58:44.576
Thank you.
Bye-bye. Good luck.

00:59:10.702 --> 00:59:12.200
<i>What's happening down there?</i>

00:59:12.202 --> 00:59:13.769
<i>You okay?</i>

00:59:13.771 --> 00:59:15.838
<i>Yeah. I'm okay.</i>

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.409
<i>Just some teeny,
tiny eight-foot sharks.</i>

00:59:26.249 --> 00:59:28.684
<i>Here we go.</i>

00:59:30.354 --> 00:59:31.787
We've got her attention.

00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:33.589
Suyin, it's on its way.

00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:35.158
- 50 meters.
- 50 meters.

00:59:38.128 --> 00:59:39.396
<i>30.</i>

00:59:41.198 --> 00:59:42.297
<i>10 meters.</i>

01:00:00.384 --> 01:00:01.586
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:03.087 --> 01:00:05.387
<i>Wow.</i>

01:00:05.389 --> 01:00:07.792
<i>I'm going to try
to hit it in the eye.</i>

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.663
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:00:23.441 --> 01:00:25.007
Whoa! Watch it.

01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:26.309
Whoa! Hey!

01:00:36.654 --> 01:00:38.589
Oh, sh...

01:00:46.597 --> 01:00:49.131
<i>Yes!
The poison is in.</i>

01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:51.602
<i>Okay, Suyin, hang in there.</i>

01:00:54.906 --> 01:00:57.405
<i>I'm trapped!
I'm in its mouth!</i>

01:00:57.407 --> 01:00:59.041
That cage will not break.

01:00:59.043 --> 01:01:02.412
<i>That's the problem.
The cage is being swallowed.</i>

01:01:16.127 --> 01:01:17.660
Hell, yeah!

01:01:28.271 --> 01:01:30.675
- Not this again.
- Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:01:57.135 --> 01:02:01.271
<i>New problem. My mask
is broken. I'm losing air.</i>

01:02:08.345 --> 01:02:09.881
Help!

01:02:13.283 --> 01:02:14.485
Help!

01:02:19.557 --> 01:02:21.358
Come on, Jaxx!

01:02:25.797 --> 01:02:28.331
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:02:33.838 --> 01:02:35.171
<i>No, Jonas.</i>

01:02:35.173 --> 01:02:37.475
<i>Go! Get back to the ship.</i>

01:02:38.242 --> 01:02:39.944
<i>It's not safe for you.</i>

01:02:42.547 --> 01:02:44.849
<i>Jonas, go back.</i>

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:46.951
<i>Jonas.</i>

01:02:56.961 --> 01:02:59.195
<i>Jonas, the crane's in the water!</i>

01:02:59.197 --> 01:03:01.499
<i>It's gonna pull her
to the bottom. Hurry!</i>

01:03:05.136 --> 01:03:07.069
Swing the second crane over.

01:03:07.071 --> 01:03:09.841
We're gonna set a trap.
Guys, I need some bait.

01:03:31.963 --> 01:03:33.429
Come on. Got him!

01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:34.966
Whoa!

01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:25.516
Over here!

01:04:27.551 --> 01:04:30.187
This way. Throw a rope.

01:04:31.355 --> 01:04:32.757
She's not breathing.

01:05:18.135 --> 01:05:19.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:19.337 --> 01:05:20.803
Take it easy.

01:05:20.805 --> 01:05:22.139
You were dead a minute ago.

01:05:22.873 --> 01:05:24.208
Doctor.

01:05:28.212 --> 01:05:30.779
You got me out.

01:05:30.781 --> 01:05:32.783
It was closer
than I woulda liked.

01:05:34.251 --> 01:05:37.021
Can I have a minute with Jonas?

01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:39.623
Sure.

01:05:52.503 --> 01:05:55.673
You saved me. Again.

01:05:56.607 --> 01:05:58.209
I prefer you alive.

01:06:02.046 --> 01:06:04.515
There's something
you might wanna see.

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:07.452
Wow.

01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:08.786
Wow.

01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:20.863
- Hey! Look who's up.
- Hey.

01:06:20.865 --> 01:06:23.934
- How are ya?
- I'm better. Thank you.

01:06:24.935 --> 01:06:26.735
Jonas, get a picture of me

01:06:26.737 --> 01:06:28.570
with this big smelly beast.

01:06:28.572 --> 01:06:30.906
Okay. Wait. Here.

01:06:30.908 --> 01:06:32.174
Hey, you want a proper picture,

01:06:32.176 --> 01:06:33.644
get your head inside.

01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:35.611
- Closer.
- Closer?

01:06:35.613 --> 01:06:37.012
Come on. Get in.

01:06:37.014 --> 01:06:37.880
Okay.

01:06:37.882 --> 01:06:40.017
Ugh!

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:45.921
Nice one.

01:06:45.923 --> 01:06:48.590
Yo, Jonas, please tell me
you got that.

01:06:48.592 --> 01:06:50.294
I got that, DJ.

01:06:51.328 --> 01:06:52.661
That's not funny, man!

01:06:52.663 --> 01:06:53.862
No, like seriously, it's funny.

01:06:53.864 --> 01:06:55.866
Look. Watch this.

01:07:06.977 --> 01:07:08.746
Look at him next to the meg.

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.982
Look, remember the bite marks
on the O-Level?

01:07:13.984 --> 01:07:15.784
Well, how do you like that?

01:07:15.786 --> 01:07:18.654
That was a serious
man vs. nature moment.

01:07:18.656 --> 01:07:20.925
I'm just glad
things went our way.

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:23.694
It didn't go our way.

01:07:24.695 --> 01:07:26.230
Not for Toshi.

01:07:27.566 --> 01:07:29.767
And not for science.

01:07:30.768 --> 01:07:33.402
We did what people always do.

01:07:33.404 --> 01:07:37.074
Discover and then destroy.

01:07:40.244 --> 01:07:41.210
Ugh.

01:07:41.212 --> 01:07:42.845
Hey, I will end you.

01:07:42.847 --> 01:07:44.613
At least you can use this
as your dating app pic.

01:07:44.615 --> 01:07:46.115

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:47.249
Yeah!

01:07:47.251 --> 01:07:49.051
Oh, yeah!

01:07:49.053 --> 01:07:50.654
- Jellyfish.
- Whoo-hoo!

01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:33.061
Two! There's two?

01:08:33.063 --> 01:08:34.765
Nobody said there were two.

01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:37.600
How are there two?

01:08:37.602 --> 01:08:39.001
Help me!
Get me out of this water!

01:08:39.003 --> 01:08:41.437
Help! Somebody help, please!

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:42.871
Help!

01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:44.339
What is wrong with you?

01:08:44.341 --> 01:08:46.509
I can't... I can't swim.

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:48.410
No! Get outta here! Really?

01:08:48.412 --> 01:08:50.179
Don't pull that
racist stuff on me.

01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:51.213
Oh, come on, man.

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:52.881
Give me a break.
I'm not being racist.

01:08:52.883 --> 01:08:57.252
You work, literally,
in the middle of the ocean.

01:08:57.254 --> 01:08:59.154
This wasn't
part of the job description.

01:08:59.156 --> 01:09:01.624
None of this was part
of the job description!

01:09:01.626 --> 01:09:03.260
They left that part out!

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:16.004
It's time to get some real help.

01:09:16.006 --> 01:09:17.706
Yeah. Go get some help.

01:09:20.311 --> 01:09:21.611
I'm quitting.

01:09:21.613 --> 01:09:24.114
Mac! Give me a hand.

01:09:28.986 --> 01:09:32.087
Hey, I need you
to find my location.

01:09:32.089 --> 01:09:34.624
Track my sat phone.
There's a second shark.

01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:36.191
Yes, two.

01:09:36.193 --> 01:09:37.826
How the hell should I know?

01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:39.928
Just hurry up
and get us some help.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:41.063
Thank you, Jonas. Thank you.

01:09:41.065 --> 01:09:42.331
Bring whatever you got!

01:09:42.333 --> 01:09:44.467
Just relax. Relax.

01:09:44.469 --> 01:09:46.034
It's not good.

01:09:46.036 --> 01:09:47.903
He needs a hospital fast.

01:09:47.905 --> 01:09:50.339
Let's get the doctor.
Where's Doctor Heller?

01:09:51.742 --> 01:09:52.943
Jaxx?

01:09:53.712 --> 01:09:55.712
Jaxx, you okay?

01:09:55.714 --> 01:09:57.948
Yeah! Kind of.

01:10:00.485 --> 01:10:01.917
Jaxx...

01:10:01.919 --> 01:10:03.752
We can do this.

01:10:03.754 --> 01:10:05.422
Swim gently back to the boat.

01:10:06.023 --> 01:10:07.925
Nice and easy.

01:10:12.997 --> 01:10:14.731
Here it comes!

01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:16.000
Heller!

01:10:16.668 --> 01:10:18.302
We're not gonna make it.

01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:20.969
Jaxx.

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.371
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:22.373 --> 01:10:25.276
- You're a good person, Jaxx.
- Wait, what?

01:10:25.976 --> 01:10:27.443
Don't look back.

01:10:27.445 --> 01:10:28.844
- Hey!
- No!

01:10:28.846 --> 01:10:29.945
Heller, no!

01:10:29.947 --> 01:10:31.380
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

01:10:31.382 --> 01:10:33.115
Hey, come on!

01:10:33.117 --> 01:10:36.186
Hey! Hey, come on!

01:10:36.787 --> 01:10:37.988
Hey!

01:10:40.492 --> 01:10:42.326
Heller!

01:10:51.603 --> 01:10:53.835
Almost there.

01:10:53.837 --> 01:10:56.273
- Come on.
- We got you.

01:10:59.009 --> 01:11:01.910
It's okay, Jaxx.

01:11:01.912 --> 01:11:03.481
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:10.821 --> 01:11:15.425
Thank you, Heller, thank you.

01:11:15.427 --> 01:11:18.093
What was that?
What the hell was that?

01:11:18.095 --> 01:11:20.262
- Okay, come on, DJ.
- No! No!

01:11:20.264 --> 01:11:22.230
This is why we don't
leave the station, okay?

01:11:22.232 --> 01:11:24.066
That's why you don't do that!

01:11:24.068 --> 01:11:26.469
And you went down there
and you pissed it off,

01:11:26.471 --> 01:11:29.237
now it's gonna come back
and kill every one of us!

01:11:29.239 --> 01:11:30.707
Now what are we supposed to do?

01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:32.442
I shouldn't even be out here
in the first place.

01:11:32.444 --> 01:11:35.310
Swimming in this ocean.
That one ate the other one.

01:11:35.312 --> 01:11:37.379
Is another one
gonna eat this one?

01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:39.283
Man, it's...

01:11:40.485 --> 01:11:42.384
It just killed Heller.

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:45.523
It killed The Wall.
It killed Toshi.

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:50.094
These are my friends, man.

01:11:59.002 --> 01:12:00.202
Okay, can I just point out

01:12:00.204 --> 01:12:01.604
that this thing is sinking?

01:12:01.606 --> 01:12:02.904
What are we gonna do now?

01:12:02.906 --> 01:12:04.141
Where's Mac?

01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:20.257
Yes!

01:12:34.773 --> 01:12:36.739
What happened to your hair?

01:12:36.741 --> 01:12:38.075
What happened to your hair?

01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:40.210
Touche.

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:43.180
Guys!

01:12:45.949 --> 01:12:47.351
That thing is the devil.

01:12:48.385 --> 01:12:50.586
10 miles, it's still with us.

01:12:50.588 --> 01:12:52.254
You got us?

01:12:52.256 --> 01:12:54.424
The ocean. The middle
of a freaking ocean!

01:12:54.426 --> 01:12:55.892
Do you think
it'd slow down the shark

01:12:55.894 --> 01:12:58.228
if we threw him over?

01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:01.764
You got to work on yourself.

01:13:01.766 --> 01:13:02.998
Okay. Good news, guys.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.436
It's payback time.

01:13:06.069 --> 01:13:08.038
Oh, yeah!

01:13:40.472 --> 01:13:41.904
Yes! Get some!

01:13:41.906 --> 01:13:43.639
You seriously think that a rifle

01:13:43.641 --> 01:13:44.640
is gonna hurt that thing?

01:13:44.642 --> 01:13:46.542
I didn't have much notice, okay?

01:13:46.544 --> 01:13:49.079
I just wanted to get it
off our backs.

01:13:49.881 --> 01:13:51.079
Well done, Morris.

01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:52.382
Whoo!

01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:43.391
It's okay.

01:15:43.393 --> 01:15:45.763
Mummy! Mummy!

01:15:46.965 --> 01:15:49.166
Welcome back, Mummy.

01:16:38.116 --> 01:16:39.416
Come in.

01:16:45.322 --> 01:16:46.758
How's Meiying?

01:16:48.225 --> 01:16:50.158
She's sad.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:52.530
And confused.

01:16:53.865 --> 01:16:55.332
How are you?

01:16:57.135 --> 01:16:59.904
I really don't want
to accept it.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.443
Sometimes things happen
that change your life forever.

01:17:07.445 --> 01:17:10.079
Meanwhile,
the world just keeps going.

01:17:10.081 --> 01:17:14.485
You think maybe it would stop
just for a second...

01:17:16.988 --> 01:17:18.854
But it doesn't.

01:17:18.856 --> 01:17:20.725
How do you live with it?

01:17:22.126 --> 01:17:23.360
I don't.

01:17:24.327 --> 01:17:28.030
I left my two best friends
to die.

01:17:28.032 --> 01:17:30.933
I think about it all the time.

01:17:30.935 --> 01:17:32.737
Every day I replay it.

01:17:33.971 --> 01:17:36.639
Could I have done more?

01:17:36.641 --> 01:17:39.677
It's not just about
the ones you lose.

01:17:41.579 --> 01:17:45.650
It's also about
the ones you save.

01:17:50.888 --> 01:17:52.690
I'm glad you're here.

01:18:04.836 --> 01:18:07.803
I've informed the Chinese
government about the meg.

01:18:07.805 --> 01:18:10.606
As well as the authorities
in Thailand,

01:18:10.608 --> 01:18:12.908
Vietnam, Indonesia,
and Australia.

01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:17.079
The Chinese are sending
two destroyers to take it out.

01:18:17.081 --> 01:18:19.515
So, this is now officially

01:18:19.517 --> 01:18:22.285
and thankfully out of our hands.

01:18:24.989 --> 01:18:26.591
I'm closing <i>Mana One</i>

01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:29.892
until the meg is killed

01:18:29.894 --> 01:18:34.262
and an evacuation ship is
coming here tomorrow morning.

01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:35.831
You damn right.

01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:38.636
And finally, I just want to say

01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:46.944
I'm sorry for your losses.

01:18:48.112 --> 01:18:49.914
Your friends.

01:18:51.682 --> 01:18:54.351
I came here
to celebrate with you,

01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:58.856
and now I'm mourning with you.

01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:14.672
Thanks for saving our asses.

01:19:24.015 --> 01:19:25.948
What do you got for me?

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:28.951
These are Semtex high velocity
demolition charges.

01:19:28.953 --> 01:19:32.054
I had the men rig delay fuses
to give them time to sink.

01:19:32.056 --> 01:19:34.625
Essentially,
they're depth charges.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:37.993
That's right.

01:19:37.995 --> 01:19:41.329
I'm not sure this is
a advisable course of action.

01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:44.700
Every person that gets maimed
or killed by that thing

01:19:44.702 --> 01:19:46.101
is a potential lawsuit.

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:47.605
A potential casualty.

01:19:48.973 --> 01:19:51.841
Relax, bro.
It's gonna be fun.

01:19:55.479 --> 01:19:58.848
- I can see your cards.
- Well, look at you two crooks.

01:19:58.850 --> 01:20:00.082
Hey.

01:20:00.084 --> 01:20:02.017
How are you feeling?

01:20:02.019 --> 01:20:03.052
Like I got off easy,

01:20:03.054 --> 01:20:04.522
compared to
the rest of you guys.

01:20:05.156 --> 01:20:06.389
Mmm.

01:20:07.091 --> 01:20:08.557
What do you got up there?

01:20:08.559 --> 01:20:09.758
Three kings.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.028
What? Come on! Every time.

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:15.197
You owe me a soda for that one.

01:20:15.199 --> 01:20:16.999
Fine.

01:20:17.001 --> 01:20:19.134
We'll square up
when you get back, okay?

01:20:19.136 --> 01:20:21.904
Fine. Fine. Fine.

01:20:21.906 --> 01:20:23.939
Just trying to take her mind
off things, you know.

01:20:23.941 --> 01:20:25.977
She's tougher than me,
that's for sure.

01:20:29.847 --> 01:20:31.914
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:34.450
Well, you didn't call me crazy.

01:20:34.452 --> 01:20:36.252
Yeah, but I didn't
call you sane.

01:20:36.254 --> 01:20:39.557
Yeah, well, "sane" wasn't
a word I heard very often.

01:20:41.559 --> 01:20:43.225
So, what now?

01:20:43.227 --> 01:20:45.961
I don't know.
Go back to Thailand, I guess.

01:20:45.963 --> 01:20:48.030
Mac told me about you and Suyin.

01:20:48.032 --> 01:20:51.867
- Nothing to tell.
- Well, maybe there could be.

01:20:51.869 --> 01:20:53.168
You and Mac are unbelievable.

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:56.138
How about you just
try something new?

01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:58.474
So the rest of your life
isn't a vast wasteland

01:20:58.476 --> 01:21:01.243
of misery and solitude.

01:21:01.245 --> 01:21:03.646
I think that's a good idea.

01:21:03.648 --> 01:21:04.980
You do, huh?

01:21:04.982 --> 01:21:06.849
Eight-year-olds hear everything.

01:21:06.851 --> 01:21:09.053
Jonas...

01:21:12.657 --> 01:21:14.992
My mom likes you, too.

01:21:19.563 --> 01:21:22.700
This is possibly
the worst moment of my life.

01:21:25.636 --> 01:21:27.269
<i>Approaching target area.</i>

01:21:27.271 --> 01:21:28.673
<i>I'll confirm visual.</i>

01:21:30.908 --> 01:21:33.142
Let me make myself
absolutely clear.

01:21:33.144 --> 01:21:35.778
We are not getting within
a mile of that monster

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:37.813
until the helicopter kills it.

01:21:37.815 --> 01:21:39.949
<i>We have a visual on the target.</i>

01:21:39.951 --> 01:21:41.483
Stop the boat.

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:42.687
Stop the boat.

01:21:45.589 --> 01:21:47.525
<i>Deploying depth charges.</i>

01:22:01.472 --> 01:22:02.740
We got him.

01:22:04.342 --> 01:22:05.674
Hit it again.

01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:06.742
<i>Sir, there's no way possible...</i>

01:22:06.744 --> 01:22:07.945
Hit it again.

01:22:14.418 --> 01:22:17.686
<i>Target is dead.
Repeat, target is dead.</i>

01:22:17.688 --> 01:22:19.288
Are you absolutely sure?

01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:20.457
Because I'm not getting eaten

01:22:20.459 --> 01:22:22.191
by some goddamn
prehistoric fish.

01:22:22.193 --> 01:22:24.760
<i>Affirmative, sir.
There's, uh...</i>

01:22:24.762 --> 01:22:27.529
Well, there's pieces of it
all over the place.

01:22:27.531 --> 01:22:29.631
<i>Shark chunks?</i>

01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:31.333
That's a good sign.

01:22:31.335 --> 01:22:34.105
All right. Take us in.

01:22:41.545 --> 01:22:43.078
Oh!

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.147
Jump down there,
get me a couple of teeth.

01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:46.215
Big ones for my desk.

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:48.285
- All right.
- Keep one for yourself.

01:22:49.253 --> 01:22:50.855
Nice.

01:22:53.824 --> 01:22:55.292
Oh, you seeing this?

01:22:56.694 --> 01:22:57.928
Crazy.

01:23:03.134 --> 01:23:04.935
That's sick.

01:23:10.274 --> 01:23:11.642
That's weird.

01:23:16.981 --> 01:23:19.715
Oh, man!
Don't do that to me.

01:23:19.717 --> 01:23:21.617
That thing
doesn't have any teeth.

01:23:21.619 --> 01:23:23.252
What?

01:23:23.254 --> 01:23:24.822
I think we killed a whale.

01:23:27.892 --> 01:23:29.693
It's right below us.

01:23:30.594 --> 01:23:31.862
Get us outta here!

01:23:36.934 --> 01:23:39.401
Wait! Wait,
you idiots! Wait!

01:23:39.403 --> 01:23:41.338
I'm over here! Wait!

01:23:43.741 --> 01:23:46.043
Oh, no!

01:24:06.531 --> 01:24:07.832
Oh!

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:23.614
Yeah, I understand.
I understand, yep. Thank you.

01:24:25.484 --> 01:24:27.850
Let me guess,
Morris never called anyone.

01:24:27.852 --> 01:24:29.118
Didn't call anyone.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.786
No one knows
the shark's out there.

01:24:30.788 --> 01:24:32.589
No one. Not the Australians,

01:24:32.591 --> 01:24:33.922
not the Chinese. No one.

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:35.425
The hell was he thinking?

01:24:35.427 --> 01:24:37.860
He wanted to make this go away
as quietly as possible.

01:24:37.862 --> 01:24:39.027
Mac, we need to let everyone...

01:24:39.029 --> 01:24:40.430
Let everyone know.
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:24:40.432 --> 01:24:41.930
Jaxx, can you find that thing?

01:24:41.932 --> 01:24:43.566
Wait, wait, wait.
Why're you asking her that?

01:24:43.568 --> 01:24:45.888
I don't like the fact that you
asking her about that thing.

01:24:46.837 --> 01:24:48.203
You want me to illegally hack

01:24:48.205 --> 01:24:50.005
into Morris' satellite
tracking system

01:24:50.007 --> 01:24:52.542
- to find a prehistoric shark?
- Yeah.

01:24:52.544 --> 01:24:54.042
Okay.

01:24:54.044 --> 01:24:56.479
We use a tracker,
find the meg, and we kill it.

01:24:56.481 --> 01:24:57.681
Bro.

01:24:59.717 --> 01:25:01.116
We really gonna do this?

01:25:01.118 --> 01:25:03.018
A lot of people are gonna die
if we don't, Mac.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.521
- Well, I'm in.
- Me, too.

01:25:04.523 --> 01:25:06.288
Let's do this.

01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:08.724
How do you feel about
commandeering that evac ship?

01:25:08.726 --> 01:25:10.893
I'd say,

01:25:10.895 --> 01:25:12.730
it's a great day to go fishing.

01:25:13.864 --> 01:25:15.063
Now let's get everything on it.

01:25:15.065 --> 01:25:17.032
Construction explosives,
gliders.

01:25:17.034 --> 01:25:18.434
The whole lot. Everything.

01:25:18.436 --> 01:25:20.470
Because we're about
to evac, right?

01:25:20.472 --> 01:25:21.770
Like evacuate?

01:25:21.772 --> 01:25:23.939
Like, leave the area
of imminent danger

01:25:23.941 --> 01:25:27.912
and go to a safe place
like normal people?

01:25:38.557 --> 01:25:39.988
What we got, Jaxx?
Anything?

01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:42.691
Yeah. Here's where we saw
Morris attack the shark.

01:25:42.693 --> 01:25:45.360
But here is where it's going.

01:25:45.362 --> 01:25:46.828
Sanya Bay. What's there?

01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:47.963
Oh, nothing.

01:25:47.965 --> 01:25:49.264
It only has some of the most

01:25:49.266 --> 01:25:51.233
densely populated beaches
in the world.

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:52.635
Any luck with the authorities?

01:25:52.637 --> 01:25:54.069
No.

01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:56.472
"Prehistoric shark" sounds
like a damn prank call.

01:25:56.474 --> 01:25:58.508
We can't rely on them
for anything.

01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:00.510
How long until the
shark gets to those people?

01:26:00.512 --> 01:26:01.710
20 minutes.

01:26:01.712 --> 01:26:03.513
- Can we get there first?
- Doubtful.

01:26:03.515 --> 01:26:04.846
Yeah, we're gonna have to.

01:26:04.848 --> 01:26:05.981
Getting there first
won't mean anything

01:26:05.983 --> 01:26:07.550
if we don't have a plan.

01:26:07.552 --> 01:26:09.454
Maybe we have a plan.

01:26:12.323 --> 01:26:14.990
Here's where we do it.
Right here in the shallows.

01:26:14.992 --> 01:26:16.758
Use the gliders and go after it.

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:18.695
Okay, so, how are we
gonna get it here,

01:26:18.697 --> 01:26:21.464
when there's a beach full
of people to eat right here?

01:26:21.466 --> 01:26:23.901
You ask it out for dinner.

01:26:36.113 --> 01:26:38.782
So...
How do you wanna do this?

01:26:39.684 --> 01:26:41.218
Is that you asking my opinion?

01:26:41.852 --> 01:26:43.051
No.

01:26:43.053 --> 01:26:44.654
I was just being polite

01:26:44.656 --> 01:26:47.889
before telling you
what we're actually doing,

01:26:47.891 --> 01:26:49.659
so you feel
better about yourself.

01:26:49.661 --> 01:26:51.028
Appreciate that.

01:26:58.235 --> 01:26:59.236
What?

01:26:59.704 --> 01:27:01.370
Nothing.

01:27:01.372 --> 01:27:02.440
We're ready.

01:28:25.356 --> 01:28:27.523
Pippin!

01:29:53.711 --> 01:29:55.212
Oh, my God!

01:30:06.524 --> 01:30:08.458
We're close enough.
Stop here.

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.693
Jaxx, DJ, we gotta get
that thing in the water.

01:30:10.695 --> 01:30:11.729
Yeah, we're on it.

01:31:08.686 --> 01:31:12.389
Shark! Shark!

01:33:17.682 --> 01:33:19.815
<i>Any last
thoughts about our plan?</i>

01:33:19.817 --> 01:33:21.884
Not dying would be a good start.

01:33:21.886 --> 01:33:24.352
Finally, we agree on something.

01:33:24.354 --> 01:33:26.589
<i>Let's not make it a habit.</i>

01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:28.392
<i>Suyin, look out!
Get out of there!</i>

01:33:39.336 --> 01:33:40.836
- Damn it!
- What's wrong, Jonas?

01:33:40.838 --> 01:33:43.373
Can't make the shot.
It's too close to the ship.

01:33:44.742 --> 01:33:45.777
Jesus!

01:33:48.146 --> 01:33:49.745
<i>Jonas, it's on you.</i>

01:33:49.747 --> 01:33:50.782
Mac!

01:33:54.152 --> 01:33:55.651
Jonas, what's going on
down there?

01:33:55.653 --> 01:33:57.655
Trying to stay out of its mouth.

01:34:19.309 --> 01:34:20.511
Jeez!

01:34:28.351 --> 01:34:29.620
Oops.

01:34:31.489 --> 01:34:33.055
<i>Suyin, are you set?
I'm coming to you.</i>

01:34:33.057 --> 01:34:34.757
I'm in position.

01:34:34.759 --> 01:34:36.192
<i>Shark's getting close.</i>

01:34:36.194 --> 01:34:37.895
I need a little breathing room.

01:34:44.202 --> 01:34:46.571
- I'm ready to fire.
- <i>Take the shot.</i>

01:34:48.371 --> 01:34:49.607
<i>Move! Move!</i>

01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:12.762
Anybody see it?

01:35:12.764 --> 01:35:14.884
<i>Can't see the shark, but
something's going on up here.</i>

01:35:24.675 --> 01:35:27.011
<i>Okay, I've got her attention.</i>

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:31.482
Bring her to me.

01:35:32.083 --> 01:35:33.350
Here we come.

01:35:36.319 --> 01:35:38.355
Make your move, Suyin.

01:35:41.759 --> 01:35:43.995
Chew on this, you ugly bastard.

01:35:47.364 --> 01:35:49.066
No, no, no! Shit!

01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:52.369
Jeez!

01:36:16.894 --> 01:36:19.730
No, no, no. Go! Go! Go!

01:36:31.408 --> 01:36:33.576
- Where's DJ?
- I don't know.

01:36:33.578 --> 01:36:34.944
- Where's Meiying?
- I don't know!

01:36:34.946 --> 01:36:37.079
- <i>I couldn't see her anywhere.</i>
- Jonas.

01:36:37.081 --> 01:36:39.050
- <i>Sorry, I...</i>
- Go, go. Take care of Meiying.

01:36:46.824 --> 01:36:48.123
Jonas!

01:36:48.125 --> 01:36:50.595
<i>I'm okay. I'm leading
it away from the ship.</i>

01:36:53.865 --> 01:36:57.333
- Oh, my God! Gotta get...
- Stop splashing!

01:36:57.335 --> 01:36:59.535
You have a life jacket on!

01:36:59.537 --> 01:37:01.570
- A life jacket?
- Yep.

01:37:01.572 --> 01:37:03.706
Oh, yeah.
I've got a life jacket on.

01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:05.710
It's right here. I can...

01:37:06.409 --> 01:37:08.143
The monster's here.

01:37:08.145 --> 01:37:09.578
The monster's here?

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:10.813
No, don't worry
about the monster, I got you.

01:37:10.815 --> 01:37:13.117
- Everything's fine.
- Stop talking.

01:37:17.321 --> 01:37:18.520
Meiying!

01:37:18.522 --> 01:37:20.623
Mummy! It's you!

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:23.025
That's good! Wait! Wait!
Wait for me.

01:37:23.027 --> 01:37:25.561
Wait for DJ,
wait for DJ. Yeah.

01:37:25.563 --> 01:37:26.831
- Yes.
- Come on.

01:37:28.232 --> 01:37:30.167
Mummy, are you okay?

01:37:32.069 --> 01:37:33.569
I'm okay.

01:37:33.571 --> 01:37:35.706
I'm okay, too.

01:37:38.643 --> 01:37:39.844
Come on. Come up!

01:37:41.712 --> 01:37:44.179
- Meiying, be careful.
- Jonas!

01:37:44.181 --> 01:37:46.148
Careful! Careful!

01:37:46.150 --> 01:37:48.117
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

01:37:48.119 --> 01:37:49.618
Jonas!

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.886
It's coming.

01:37:50.888 --> 01:37:52.187
We're sitting ducks
up here, Jonas.

01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:53.889
<i>- Mummy!
- It's coming.</i>

01:37:53.891 --> 01:37:55.758
<i>- Can you hear me, Jonas?
- Meiying, hold on.</i>

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.493
<i>Suyin, we're gonna
have to go. Through here.</i>

01:37:57.495 --> 01:37:59.995
Jonas, we've got nothing left.

01:37:59.997 --> 01:38:01.664
Almost nothing.

01:38:01.666 --> 01:38:03.332
How're you gonna kill it?

01:38:03.334 --> 01:38:04.533
<i>Evolution.</i>

01:38:04.535 --> 01:38:06.802
I'm gonna make this thing bleed.

01:38:06.804 --> 01:38:09.071
<i>Suyin, what you said before,
you were right.</i>

01:38:09.073 --> 01:38:10.975
It's not about
the people you lose.

01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:15.179
<i>It's about the people you save.</i>

01:38:16.881 --> 01:38:18.616
- Signing off.
- <i>Jonas!</i>

01:38:25.656 --> 01:38:26.824
Here we go.

01:38:33.764 --> 01:38:36.133
How do you like that? Bleed!

01:38:44.775 --> 01:38:46.177
Come on, come on, come on.

01:38:56.387 --> 01:38:57.454
Come on.

01:40:52.571 --> 01:40:53.804
Hey!

01:40:54.305 --> 01:40:55.339
Hey!

01:40:59.677 --> 01:41:00.878
Yes!

01:41:29.173 --> 01:41:30.174
Thank you.

01:41:34.044 --> 01:41:35.811
Beep-beep!
Coming through, Crazy.

01:41:35.813 --> 01:41:37.248
- Hi.
- Look who it is.

01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:41.917
Well,

01:41:41.919 --> 01:41:44.255
here's to being alive.

01:41:47.725 --> 01:41:49.260
And to our friends.

01:41:55.733 --> 01:41:56.934
Cheers!

01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:02.771
I don't know about you.

01:42:02.773 --> 01:42:05.774
But, uh, I could use a vacation.

01:42:05.776 --> 01:42:07.311
Shall we ask my mum?

01:42:44.499 --> 01:42:49.499
