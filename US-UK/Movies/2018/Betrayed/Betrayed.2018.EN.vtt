00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.870
No way,
I'll get in so much trouble.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.674
Yeah, maybe we can just
figure something out tomorrow?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.420
Oh, come on,
why do you have to be so lame?

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.844
- Let's just go now.
- It's seriously almost 1:00 a.m.

00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:30.279
and I'm already gonna get
in so much trouble.

00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:32.249
So, what's the difference, then?

00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:35.184
Yeah, okay, yeah,
we really need to go.

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.354
It's late, and...

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:37.922
Whatever, dude,
don't worry about it.

00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:40.757
So lame.

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:42.959
Hey, yeah, you know what?
Maybe we are lame!

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:45.095
Hey, don't argue with them
let's just leave.

00:01:46.996 --> 00:01:48.998
I wasn't gonna go anyways.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.434
You know they're
only after one thing.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:54.204
Yeah, guys are pigs.

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:43.113
First off, Mikhail,

00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:45.115
I told you, not here.

00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:47.050
Not in my office!

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.252
I thought we understood
each other.

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.055
I hear you no like my business.

00:03:52.956 --> 00:03:55.025
But I'm paying,
I don't understand.

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:56.458
Five women.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:04:00.463
Excuse me, three young teenagers

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.465
and two 20-year-old women

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:07.203
were abducted from my city
by your thugs!

00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:12.108
- I have high demands. I needed...
- You don't need shit!

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:14.844
You don't understand!

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.646
I have to answer for this!

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:18.793
The Chief and I,
we're taking too much heat

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.483
because you didn't keep
your promise!

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.387
Maybe business will slow down.

00:04:23.654 --> 00:04:25.822
Maybe I won't need so many
for a while.

00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:28.258
Yeah, sure.

00:04:31.027 --> 00:04:32.462
Listen,

00:04:33.163 --> 00:04:37.067
I will do what I do, no matter
if you take the money or no.

00:04:38.435 --> 00:04:41.305
What would you do,
go to the police?

00:04:42.238 --> 00:04:43.340
You don't get it, do you?

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:48.378
You're leaving me no choice!

00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:51.848
Think.

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:54.651
What's good for me
is good for you.

00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:57.921
Maybe I slow down.

00:04:58.122 --> 00:05:00.424
Maybe I go to the suburbs
a little.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.260
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.130
This is no need to stop
our business.

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:10.635
I know you like my candy
too well.

00:05:11.901 --> 00:05:14.038
Best we think on this, hmm?

00:05:24.414 --> 00:05:25.882
Jesus Christ!

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.762
Hey, sweetie.

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:40.398
We still on for dinner?

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:47.671
- This year is it.
- You're crazy!

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.072
I think they have two or three

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.641
good years left
before they're done.

00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:51.774
- No, no way.
- Yeah.

00:05:52.007 --> 00:05:54.878
Excuse me, they found
another body in a dumpster.

00:05:59.548 --> 00:06:00.548
Damn.

00:06:01.217 --> 00:06:02.018
Gettin' bad out there.

00:06:02.118 --> 00:06:04.053
The coroner's bringing her in.

00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:05.221
How old?

00:06:05.856 --> 00:06:06.856
Do they even know?

00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:09.960
No, but she's, uh, young,
under 30.

00:06:11.027 --> 00:06:12.027
Shit.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.432
Alderman needs to take
a strong public stand on this.

00:06:15.098 --> 00:06:16.098
Yeah.

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.368
All right, let's get to work.

00:06:26.142 --> 00:06:27.142
Hey!

00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:29.445
Before you leave...

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.752
- we need to check your sleeves.
- No one cleans us out like that.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.422
I won fair and square.

00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:40.255
Is that so?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.358
Let's see those sleeves.

00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:46.495
Listen, brick head, you
and your dumbass friend lost.

00:06:46.997 --> 00:06:50.100
Now, you could either lose again
right here and right now

00:06:50.466 --> 00:06:51.635
or you could walk away.

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:54.472
You must think I'm
some kinda pussy, huh?

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.139
Last warning.

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.310
Fuck you!

00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:01.512
Your mother ever tell you
not to point?

00:07:03.512 --> 00:07:05.416
Now, you have a choice...

00:07:06.483 --> 00:07:07.752
learn from your friend...

00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:09.419
or make the same mistake.

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.825
- You tough, man?
- Bad move.

00:07:21.632 --> 00:07:23.501
Next time you guys
have a poker game...

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:26.035
work on your hospitality.

00:07:31.774 --> 00:07:32.876
Wow...

00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:34.611
this is amazing!

00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.188
Well, we see each other
so infrequently,

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:38.148
I thought this time
should be special.

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:41.851
And your mother would be
very happy to see you with this.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.387
And, uh, you know,
since you're my only daughter,

00:07:45.454 --> 00:07:48.125
- you're all I got left.
- You have the city, Dad.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.959
And that's your true baby
and you know it!

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:52.029
I got a lot of responsibilities,

00:07:52.094 --> 00:07:54.530
- it's different.
- I understand. I...

00:07:55.332 --> 00:07:57.800
I can't even imagine
how much you have on your plate.

00:07:57.868 --> 00:07:59.502
Yeah, there's a lot on my plate.

00:07:59.603 --> 00:08:01.504
But how about you,
how you doing?

00:08:02.372 --> 00:08:06.110
I don't know I'm more
of the same, or whatever.

00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:08.411
Hey.

00:08:10.747 --> 00:08:13.283
You'll find your calling
in due time.

00:08:13.349 --> 00:08:16.119
- Well, let's hope so.
- I'll bet on it.

00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:21.157
Uh, I gotta get up early
tomorrow. What about you?

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.390
Yeah.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.728
Are we still on for breakfast
this Friday?

00:08:24.928 --> 00:08:27.598
Yes, yeah, we are.

00:08:49.886 --> 00:08:52.423
- So, do we have? Yeah.
- The money?

00:08:52.956 --> 00:08:54.190
Yeah, of course.

00:08:57.893 --> 00:08:59.863
- Clean and unmarked.
- Great.

00:09:00.497 --> 00:09:01.899
I appreciate it, thanks.

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:03.632
And listen...

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.911
I'm gonna shut down
the Russians.

00:09:05.935 --> 00:09:07.404
You should let me take care
of the...

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.470
No, listen,

00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:12.309
I cannot afford to have
a gang war in my city.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:13.809
You see?

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:17.447
And, uh, I can't take care
of you if there is one.

00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:20.649
- It won't be a war.
- Please, trust me on this.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.887
- Okay?
- If you say so.

00:09:24.488 --> 00:09:27.824
Good. A few anonymous tips,
they'll be in prison,

00:09:28.458 --> 00:09:31.562
maybe in less than six
months, for a long time.

00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:34.064
I would rather he be dead.

00:09:34.196 --> 00:09:36.499
No.

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:39.302
Trust me on this.

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:41.336
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:44.141
I trust you'll look out for me
as long as I'm paying you.

00:09:44.907 --> 00:09:47.010
I trust that, all right?

00:09:55.185 --> 00:09:56.619
Let me see this closely.

00:09:57.854 --> 00:09:59.055
Drive careful.

00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:28.084
Christy, take a look
at this one.

00:10:29.752 --> 00:10:30.752
It's beautiful.

00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:33.421
It is.

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:35.492
You have flawless taste, Miss.

00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:37.660
- Thank you.
- Who made it?

00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:42.565
A young artist, he has a lot
of depth and soul in his work.

00:10:42.866 --> 00:10:43.967
J.B. Davies?

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:46.835
- Never heard of him.
- Hmm, he's up and coming.

00:10:47.036 --> 00:10:48.838
- I'm sure.
- How much is it?

00:10:49.204 --> 00:10:52.443
This particular piece
is only 2800 dollars.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:54.710
I'll take it.

00:11:07.523 --> 00:11:08.524
You like that?

00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:14.964
Let's go.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.002
- What?
- Let's go have some fun.

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.334
Go where?

00:11:38.555 --> 00:11:39.555
Well, you know...

00:11:41.056 --> 00:11:42.658
she's just the same
as the others.

00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:46.763
She died of an
acute drug overdose.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.530
Damn.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.569
Three in a month
and we pretty much have nothing.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.670
I know.

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.441
I've never seen
anything like it, ever.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.380
- You finding anything?
- No, nothing yet.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.650
Whoa!

00:12:11.655 --> 00:12:12.655
Look here.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.890
See that?

00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:17.627
The organs look fried.

00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:23.099
- This could be a homicide.
- I don't know.

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:27.436
But, she sure didn't do this
to herself.

00:12:27.737 --> 00:12:29.540
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:30.839
But you know,

00:12:31.574 --> 00:12:34.644
she's been on heroin
for at least a year

00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:37.548
according to
the hair follicle test we did.

00:12:47.055 --> 00:12:48.492
- What?
- Uh.

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:51.661
- Wait, I, um...
- What?

00:12:53.963 --> 00:12:57.334
- Uh, I think I know her.
- What?

00:12:57.434 --> 00:13:00.637
- Really?
- No, not exactly know, but I,

00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:06.009
I think she jogs the same trail
as me, or she used to.

00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:08.844
A heroin junkie that jogs?

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:12.849
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure it's her.

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:17.253
Well, I think I've seen
everything then.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:25.628
Okay, so what does that have
to do with me?

00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:27.264
I need your help, Wolf.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.199
I can't have the cartel

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:33.069
and the Russians both picking
our girls up off our streets.

00:13:33.536 --> 00:13:36.473
- <i>Uh, you shouldn't have either.</i>
- I understand, Mike.

00:13:38.007 --> 00:13:39.007
But, uh,

00:13:39.441 --> 00:13:40.743
you know, it's a big city.

00:13:41.877 --> 00:13:43.146
<i>I can't control everything.</i>

00:13:43.613 --> 00:13:46.315
- Is that so?
- But I've made a decision.

00:13:47.483 --> 00:13:48.918
So what do you want from me?

00:13:49.685 --> 00:13:50.685
<i>Like I said,</i>

00:13:51.387 --> 00:13:55.892
Mikhail and his Ruskies,
they're out of control.

00:13:58.494 --> 00:13:59.494
I see.

00:14:01.164 --> 00:14:02.633
Uh, keep me posted.

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:04.468
Wolf...

00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:06.203
don't judge me.

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:10.339
You're no choir boy.

00:14:11.007 --> 00:14:13.477
No, no, I am not.

00:14:23.353 --> 00:14:24.353
The mayor's asked

00:14:24.487 --> 00:14:26.390
that I not do business
with you anymore.

00:14:27.156 --> 00:14:28.257
Fuck the mayor.

00:14:29.124 --> 00:14:30.393
I wish it was that easy.

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:33.162
It is, unless you're afraid
of him.

00:14:33.228 --> 00:14:35.831
No, Mikhail,
I'm not afraid of the mayor.

00:14:35.898 --> 00:14:37.500
It's not about that.

00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:41.103
It's just that he can make
our lives a lot easier if...

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.974
I can make his life easier
or harder, too.

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:47.676
- I'm sure you can, but...
- But? No but.

00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:49.478
You want the business or not?

00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.679
I don't have a problem with you,
Mikhail.

00:14:51.714 --> 00:14:54.685
I thought we could talk
like men.

00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:58.522
All he wants you to do
is respect the rules.

00:15:06.494 --> 00:15:08.864
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules.

00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:10.399
Well, why don't we do that, hmm?

00:15:10.533 --> 00:15:13.702
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules,
fuck me, fuck you.

00:15:13.969 --> 00:15:18.173
- He's just as dirty as you or I.
- Whatever, you're right.

00:15:18.373 --> 00:15:19.575
It's your decision.

00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:22.278
But I want you to know...

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:25.382
that I'm with you, Mikhail.

00:15:26.215 --> 00:15:27.783
But I also want you to know

00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:30.320
that I am not going down
with you.

00:15:31.253 --> 00:15:32.421
Am I clear?

00:15:33.122 --> 00:15:35.025
It's what I like about you,
Stone.

00:15:35.224 --> 00:15:37.426
You are always very clear.

00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:47.401
Still wanna go there?

00:15:47.838 --> 00:15:50.674
Yeah, I'm a grown-ass woman.
I don't need to ask permission.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.675
I know but, still.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.878
Look, I get what you mean, but,

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:58.315
Foxtrot is the hot spot
right now.

00:15:58.748 --> 00:15:59.447
You know it is.

00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:01.784
I know,
it's not the kind of place

00:16:01.852 --> 00:16:03.887
the mayor's daughter
should be hanging out at.

00:16:04.021 --> 00:16:05.087
Oh, come on.

00:16:05.153 --> 00:16:06.522
We can always go
to Grasshoppers.

00:16:06.622 --> 00:16:09.092
How about we go to Foxtrot?

00:16:09.392 --> 00:16:11.728
And if it isn't on fire...

00:16:12.929 --> 00:16:14.009
then we go to Grasshoppers.

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:17.533
You know it'll be on fire
and you're gonna get in trouble.

00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:19.303
You only live once.

00:16:20.036 --> 00:16:21.371
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:36.987 --> 00:16:37.987
Darryl...

00:16:38.921 --> 00:16:39.921
find her.

00:16:40.991 --> 00:16:41.991
You sure about this?

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.860
Okay.

00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:09.051
<i>Hey.</i>

00:17:09.885 --> 00:17:11.620
I need you to trace someone
for me.

00:17:12.788 --> 00:17:13.788
<i>Okay, name?</i>

00:17:14.356 --> 00:17:15.757
Marie Alderman.

00:17:16.158 --> 00:17:18.628
Oh, shit, that's funny!

00:17:19.562 --> 00:17:24.034
- <i>Okay, a real name?</i>
- Marie Allison Alderman.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.070
You're serious?

00:17:28.805 --> 00:17:29.805
<i>I am.</i>

00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:33.610
I'm gonna have
to sit this one out.

00:17:34.376 --> 00:17:36.412
<i>Darryl, it's too risky.</i>

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.915
Maybe you wanna take that up
with Mikhail?

00:17:40.216 --> 00:17:41.216
Shit.

00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:44.252
All right, I'll trace her,

00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:47.556
but you should really try
to talk some sense into him.

00:17:47.923 --> 00:17:48.923
<i>Not my job.</i>

00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:52.260
All right,
whatever you say, man.

00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:53.662
Just get it done.

00:18:23.258 --> 00:18:24.258
She's here.

00:18:25.193 --> 00:18:27.096
- What?
- She's at the club.

00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:41.443
Hey, can we get
two Johnny Vegas?

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.612
You got it.

00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.248
Hey, we should go sit down.

00:18:45.448 --> 00:18:46.682
- Okay.
- All right.

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:48.083
That'll be 30 dollars.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:49.950
It's on me, Marco.

00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:53.757
Thank you, but we can pay
for our own drinks.

00:18:53.823 --> 00:18:57.460
- Trust me, it's no problem.
- Okay then, thank you.

00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:00.029
Why don't you come with me?

00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:07.135
<i>You're either in or you're out.</i>

00:19:07.202 --> 00:19:08.470
It's not that easy!

00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:10.774
Oh, it's not?
Let me make it easier for you.

00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:13.677
Motherfucker!

00:19:19.181 --> 00:19:20.181
Fuck!

00:19:27.324 --> 00:19:28.324
Hey girl, what's up?

00:19:28.958 --> 00:19:29.659
Are you out?

00:19:29.825 --> 00:19:31.660
Yeah, at Foxtrot with Marie.
Why?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.229
- <i>Mind if I join you?</i>
- No, not at all.

00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:35.965
Okay, cool. See you in a few.

00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:51.212
So...

00:19:52.448 --> 00:19:54.950
what do you do?
If you don't mind me asking.

00:19:56.218 --> 00:19:59.989
This, this is mine, the club.

00:20:00.856 --> 00:20:01.856
And, uh...

00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:04.628
I have some other investments.

00:20:09.164 --> 00:20:11.099
UM, Sandra just called,
she's on her way.

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:13.536
Did you wanna go wait
for her by the bar?

00:20:13.835 --> 00:20:15.771
You can always come back here.

00:20:16.206 --> 00:20:17.206
Bring your friend.

00:20:19.342 --> 00:20:20.342
Thank you.

00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:50.874
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

00:20:52.074 --> 00:20:53.642
<i>Remember the girl we had
in here?</i>

00:20:53.808 --> 00:20:55.143
<i>The heroin girl, the runner?</i>

00:20:55.443 --> 00:20:56.912
Uh, yeah.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.583
<i>Well, I found something.</i>

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:01.717
<i>It wasn't murder.</i>

00:21:03.318 --> 00:21:04.318
I mean...

00:21:04.853 --> 00:21:07.989
I guess it was,
but it wasn't intentional.

00:21:08.556 --> 00:21:10.759
- What?
- <i>When can you come in here?</i>

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:12.259
I wanna show you.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.031
Uh, on my way.

00:21:27.943 --> 00:21:30.312
I cannot believe
that we just hung out with him.

00:21:31.346 --> 00:21:32.882
In his booth, too!

00:21:33.582 --> 00:21:35.017
Oh, my God.

00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:39.022
Let's hope no pictures surface
of this one

00:21:39.087 --> 00:21:41.456
because I will never hear
the end of it.

00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:43.558
We don't really know if all that

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:45.362
stuff they say
about him is true.

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:47.063
I guess.

00:21:54.469 --> 00:21:56.706
I so needed to get out.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:01.076
Just drinking.

00:22:05.448 --> 00:22:07.615
- I'm sorry.
- That's a bummer.

00:22:07.716 --> 00:22:09.185
It's fine, it's just...

00:22:10.518 --> 00:22:12.689
No, it should have
ended a while ago.

00:22:13.154 --> 00:22:14.222
Well,

00:22:14.657 --> 00:22:17.127
let's get you a drink, then.

00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:19.094
Let's do it!

00:22:25.535 --> 00:22:27.804
- Hey.
- Hey, Alex.

00:22:29.104 --> 00:22:30.906
I'm glad you could
come so quickly.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:32.340
No problem.

00:22:32.908 --> 00:22:34.911
- So what did we find?
- Well,

00:22:35.143 --> 00:22:38.448
I received some more information
on girl number one.

00:22:39.414 --> 00:22:41.016
- Angela, was it?
- Yes.

00:22:41.182 --> 00:22:44.085
Well, it turns out she
wasn't always an addict.

00:22:44.353 --> 00:22:45.454
Or I should say,

00:22:46.087 --> 00:22:49.892
- she wasn't one for very long.
- So the overdose was a cover up?

00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:51.694
Much worse.

00:22:52.228 --> 00:22:52.996
Worse?

00:22:53.196 --> 00:22:55.865
I mean,
the heroin that killed her

00:22:56.332 --> 00:22:57.434
wasn't even injected.

00:22:59.101 --> 00:23:00.835
I mean, it wasn't even supposed
to kill her.

00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:03.538
- What do you mean?
- Take a look over here.

00:23:04.273 --> 00:23:06.242
See this,
see the shadowing over here?

00:23:06.307 --> 00:23:07.307
Mm-hmm.

00:23:07.343 --> 00:23:11.081
Well, she had heroin
bags implanted inside her.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.883
And the only thing I can think
of is one,

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.620
you know, one must have leaked
and that's,

00:23:17.953 --> 00:23:20.222
I'd say, I can see it
on the kidneys here.

00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:21.289
Take a look.

00:23:23.526 --> 00:23:24.526
Oh.

00:23:26.027 --> 00:23:29.231
So, I went back and I looked
at the other girls and,

00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:32.267
although nothing is confirmed
yet...

00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:35.338
they most likely died
in a similar fashion.

00:23:36.472 --> 00:23:37.472
A slow leak...

00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.276
you know,
just enough to kill them.

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:46.482
And these, these bastards...

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.286
they just harvested the bags
and discarded the bodies.

00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:54.421
I, uh...

00:23:54.623 --> 00:23:55.991
I'll be damned.

00:23:57.026 --> 00:24:00.095
This changes everything.
They were drug mules.

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:01.429
Exactly.

00:24:07.903 --> 00:24:09.671
We just can't seem to pin him
for anything.

00:24:10.238 --> 00:24:13.977
It's fine that we're in the same
building as him right now?

00:24:14.443 --> 00:24:15.143
Mm.

00:24:15.376 --> 00:24:17.446
You're sure we're safe, right?

00:24:18.581 --> 00:24:21.551
Yeah, I mean as long
as you stay away from his booth.

00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:26.256
Besides, if he tries anything...

00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:30.959
- I'll kick his ass.
- That is why we're best friends.

00:24:35.163 --> 00:24:36.163
Sandy...

00:24:36.632 --> 00:24:37.834
we need to talk.

00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:41.470
There's nothing left
to talk about.

00:24:41.536 --> 00:24:44.173
What the hell?
You act like this is all on me!

00:24:44.806 --> 00:24:46.342
You said you needed a break.

00:24:47.176 --> 00:24:49.478
So I gave you one, permanently.

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:51.089
That's because I'm always
playing second fiddle

00:24:51.113 --> 00:24:53.482
- to your fucking job!
- Oh, really?

00:24:55.051 --> 00:24:56.328
You knew what you were
in for dating me.

00:24:56.352 --> 00:24:58.787
I mean, you knew exactly
what you were getting into.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.389
You knew what I did
for a living.

00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:01.689
Yeah...

00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:04.394
and I didn't know how consumed
you would be by it.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.162
I think you need to go.

00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:09.931
- Oh, should I?
- Yeah.

00:25:09.998 --> 00:25:12.118
Are you allergic to spending
time with your boyfriend?

00:25:12.434 --> 00:25:13.434
Ex-boyfriend.

00:25:14.603 --> 00:25:17.139
You know what?
Fuck you anyways!

00:25:17.873 --> 00:25:19.007
Okay, buddy, take a walk.

00:25:19.074 --> 00:25:20.452
This ain't none
of your fucking business!

00:25:20.476 --> 00:25:21.476
I said walk.

00:25:21.776 --> 00:25:23.912
Okay, asshole, let's go!

00:25:25.715 --> 00:25:26.782
Who the hell was that guy?

00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:30.519
I don't know but we seen
him with Mikhail earlier.

00:25:32.921 --> 00:25:34.891
I'm just gonna make
sure nothing bad happens.

00:25:35.424 --> 00:25:38.161
- I'm coming with.
- Wait for me, guys!

00:25:40.363 --> 00:25:41.607
You gonna be cool
if I let you go?

00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:42.631
- Yes.
- Yeah?

00:25:42.664 --> 00:25:43.932
- Yes!
- All right.

00:25:46.768 --> 00:25:48.270
What the fuck are you doing?

00:25:49.572 --> 00:25:51.174
You need to calm down.

00:25:53.075 --> 00:25:54.309
Don't fucking touch me!

00:25:55.044 --> 00:25:57.213
Is this how you want it, Sandy?
Huh?

00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:09.258
That was pretty fucking stupid!

00:26:10.726 --> 00:26:12.462
Hey, are you okay?

00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:15.398
I don't know.

00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:18.468
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:26:20.702 --> 00:26:21.702
You?

00:26:22.036 --> 00:26:23.139
Don't worry about me.

00:26:25.507 --> 00:26:26.507
You okay?

00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:29.946
Where's Marie?

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.981
I don't know.

00:26:32.448 --> 00:26:33.149
Is that your friend?

00:26:33.248 --> 00:26:34.584
Yeah, did you see
where she went?

00:26:34.749 --> 00:26:36.419
No, I was kind of busy.

00:26:37.786 --> 00:26:39.021
Maybe she went back in.

00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:40.455
Maybe.

00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:50.732
Hey.

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.401
Hey, sorry I missed your call.

00:26:52.601 --> 00:26:53.702
I'm at Foxtrot.

00:26:53.802 --> 00:26:55.737
Yeah, I'm just leaving
the morgue.

00:26:56.004 --> 00:26:57.573
- Another one?
- No.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.141
But new information,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.443
these girls were likely
used to smuggle drugs.

00:27:01.678 --> 00:27:04.580
- What?
- Yeah, they were drug mules.

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:06.848
<i>Oh, that's crazy. I...</i>

00:27:07.315 --> 00:27:10.419
But hey, I have a bit
of a situation here.

00:27:11.187 --> 00:27:14.323
Uh, Brad came, made a scene,
started a fight.

00:27:14.456 --> 00:27:15.456
He what?

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.935
Long story, but I also managed
to lose Marie in this mess.

00:27:17.959 --> 00:27:20.228
So, if you don't mind
picking me up?

00:27:20.395 --> 00:27:24.599
- <i>Yeah, sure I'll be there in 20.</i>
- Cool, thanks, bye.

00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:36.211
Oh, my God!

00:27:39.347 --> 00:27:40.347
Hello?

00:27:41.616 --> 00:27:42.616
Oh, hello?

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:47.089
Please, please answer me!
Oh, my God!

00:27:53.194 --> 00:27:56.164
So, to what do I owe...

00:27:58.767 --> 00:27:59.767
for this...

00:28:01.569 --> 00:28:02.569
pleasure?

00:28:08.343 --> 00:28:10.079
I'm pretty sure you know
why I'm here.

00:28:10.446 --> 00:28:11.514
Maybe I do.

00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:14.684
Maybe I don't.

00:28:16.317 --> 00:28:18.887
I don't like to assume things,
Carlos.

00:28:18.953 --> 00:28:21.423
The Russian,
he's getting shut down.

00:28:22.959 --> 00:28:24.435
And I know
you have high level clients

00:28:24.459 --> 00:28:26.037
that will need service
when that happens.

00:28:26.061 --> 00:28:28.364
The Russian
is getting shut down?

00:28:30.766 --> 00:28:31.767
Is that so?

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.205
Carlos, have you ever met
Mikhail?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240
No.

00:28:39.709 --> 00:28:42.344
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything.

00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:46.481
You haven't met him.

00:28:48.383 --> 00:28:50.318
That's why you don't see.

00:28:54.623 --> 00:28:55.658
Mikhail...

00:28:57.558 --> 00:28:58.558
isn't...

00:28:59.394 --> 00:29:02.131
wired like the rest of us.

00:29:03.399 --> 00:29:04.399
Uh-uh.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.235
You know what I mean?

00:29:08.103 --> 00:29:10.172
Pretty soon he
won't be wired at all.

00:29:11.106 --> 00:29:12.307
I assure you...

00:29:14.043 --> 00:29:16.245
you're not the first
to say that.

00:29:19.081 --> 00:29:20.216
And yet...

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:22.950
he's still here.

00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:28.557
In Chicago I wiped people
like him off the streets...

00:29:30.158 --> 00:29:31.360
until it was mine.

00:29:31.893 --> 00:29:32.893
Carlos...

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:35.430
this is Detroit.

00:29:36.864 --> 00:29:38.366
Not Chicago!

00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:41.804
Things are different here.

00:29:44.372 --> 00:29:45.550
I came here to extend an offer,

00:29:45.574 --> 00:29:47.776
not to listen to you defend
the Russian.

00:29:47.876 --> 00:29:49.711
I'm not defending the Russian.

00:29:50.446 --> 00:29:52.314
I'm making sure
you have some idea

00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:54.350
of what you're getting yourself
into.

00:29:57.286 --> 00:29:58.888
I guess you'll go down
with him, then.

00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:01.591
Carlos.

00:30:03.459 --> 00:30:07.830
Only time will tell.

00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:14.269
Only time will tell.

00:30:19.674 --> 00:30:20.742
Last chance.

00:30:21.776 --> 00:30:24.447
Switch now or hang
onto the Russian and be done.

00:30:25.146 --> 00:30:27.215
I believe you already

00:30:27.783 --> 00:30:29.185
asked that question.

00:30:48.603 --> 00:30:50.506
Down goes Frazier.

00:30:52.741 --> 00:30:53.942
Hey, there you are.

00:30:55.111 --> 00:30:56.478
We still can't find Marie.

00:30:57.846 --> 00:30:58.546
That's weird.

00:30:58.713 --> 00:31:00.023
She wouldn't just leave us
like this.

00:31:00.047 --> 00:31:01.047
I know.

00:31:01.316 --> 00:31:03.286
Someone had to
have seen where she went.

00:31:04.553 --> 00:31:06.455
I mean, maybe she did leave.

00:31:07.255 --> 00:31:08.558
She would have said something.

00:31:15.463 --> 00:31:17.665
Settle down or we'll have
to put you back to sleep.

00:31:17.865 --> 00:31:21.569
What do you want, money?
I have money, please.

00:31:21.636 --> 00:31:23.873
- Let me go!
- Shut her up.

00:31:25.073 --> 00:31:26.374
No, please.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:36.651
Charge her up slowly.

00:31:37.018 --> 00:31:38.018
Okay.

00:31:38.487 --> 00:31:41.356
- She's not for play, Karpov.
- I understand.

00:31:41.523 --> 00:31:43.259
She's worth too much.

00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:45.058
Don't fuck it up.

00:31:59.975 --> 00:32:00.975
Yes?

00:32:01.242 --> 00:32:02.944
<i>That detective is still here.</i>

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:05.613
She wants to go through
the club after we close.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.582
Let her,
we have nothing to hide.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.052
All right, I just wanted you
to make the call.

00:32:10.518 --> 00:32:12.421
Cooperate, it's better.

00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:14.721
All right.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.383
You ready to make me some money,
yet?

00:32:42.817 --> 00:32:43.817
Uh-huh.

00:33:06.441 --> 00:33:07.441
I don't get it.

00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:10.712
She's not answering her phone,
she's not here.

00:33:11.046 --> 00:33:13.248
Look, I'm really sorry, but

00:33:13.649 --> 00:33:15.351
I'm sure she just left
with some guy.

00:33:15.584 --> 00:33:17.818
Trust me, it happens
all the time.

00:33:18.085 --> 00:33:19.653
Well, here is my card.

00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:23.057
Call me if you find anything
or if she turns up.

00:33:23.292 --> 00:33:24.393
Sure thing.

00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:25.692
Hey,

00:33:25.861 --> 00:33:27.028
I assume those work?

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.699
Yeah, they should.

00:33:30.598 --> 00:33:31.966
Do you have them all around?

00:33:32.834 --> 00:33:34.370
Yeah, we got pretty good
coverage.

00:33:35.536 --> 00:33:36.939
I'd like to see the footage.

00:33:37.706 --> 00:33:40.108
Of course, but not tonight.

00:33:40.409 --> 00:33:41.820
Unfortunately,
Mikhail's the only one

00:33:41.844 --> 00:33:43.879
who has access
to the security room.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.314
I'd like to set that
up as soon as possible.

00:33:46.613 --> 00:33:47.917
Yeah, I'll give him a call.

00:33:50.017 --> 00:33:51.177
You ladies have a good night.

00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:54.921
You, too.

00:34:02.663 --> 00:34:04.767
<i>- Da?
- We got a problem.</i>

00:34:09.038 --> 00:34:11.373
- Good morning, Laura.
- Good morning.

00:34:12.107 --> 00:34:14.375
Did you get any messages
from my daughter this morning?

00:34:14.442 --> 00:34:16.277
No, no sir. Um,

00:34:16.877 --> 00:34:18.580
let me double check
the voicemail.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.980
Thanks.

00:34:27.122 --> 00:34:28.623
- Sir?
- Yes?

00:34:28.991 --> 00:34:30.693
Nope, no message.

00:34:37.765 --> 00:34:40.335
Mayor Alderman's office,
Mrs. Moore speaking.

00:34:40.602 --> 00:34:42.236
<i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>

00:34:42.671 --> 00:34:43.906
<i>Wait, it's Sandra Miller.</i>

00:34:44.439 --> 00:34:46.774
Marie's friend. Is Donald in?

00:34:47.007 --> 00:34:49.176
Yes, are you with Marie?

00:34:49.743 --> 00:34:51.479
No, that's why I'm calling.

00:34:52.113 --> 00:34:53.882
Okay, um, hold on.

00:34:55.283 --> 00:34:56.785
- Mayor Alderman?
- Yes?

00:34:56.852 --> 00:34:59.154
It's, uh, Sandra on the phone
for you.

00:34:59.821 --> 00:35:00.522
Sandra?

00:35:00.654 --> 00:35:02.557
Yes, Marie's friend,
Sandra Miller.

00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:04.093
Oh, okay, thanks.

00:35:14.169 --> 00:35:16.672
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>

00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:19.041
Have you seen
or talked to Marie today?

00:35:19.373 --> 00:35:20.373
Sandra...

00:35:20.843 --> 00:35:23.645
no, uh, we were supposed
to have breakfast this morning

00:35:23.712 --> 00:35:24.980
but she didn't show up.

00:35:25.346 --> 00:35:28.283
Yeah, I don't know
what to do here.

00:35:28.616 --> 00:35:30.451
We kind of lost track
of each other

00:35:30.518 --> 00:35:31.620
at Foxtrot last night.

00:35:31.819 --> 00:35:34.756
Foxtrot,
you mean Kovalchek's place?

00:35:35.022 --> 00:35:36.022
<i>Yes.</i>

00:35:36.223 --> 00:35:37.492
Whose idea was that?

00:35:38.493 --> 00:35:40.996
Sir, it wasn't my call.
I showed up later.

00:35:41.129 --> 00:35:43.932
I'm sorry, no, just...
What else were you gonna say?

00:35:44.366 --> 00:35:45.734
Well, she just vanished.

00:35:49.303 --> 00:35:50.305
I don't like this.

00:35:50.638 --> 00:35:52.074
I know, neither do I.

00:35:52.373 --> 00:35:54.009
I'm heading over
to Foxtrot at 11

00:35:54.076 --> 00:35:57.813
to go over surveillance videos
and see if I can find anything.

00:35:58.279 --> 00:35:59.580
Let me know of anything
you find.

00:35:59.647 --> 00:36:01.448
I'm still hoping it's nothing,
but...

00:36:01.515 --> 00:36:03.251
<i>So do I.</i>

00:36:08.457 --> 00:36:09.558
But...

00:36:10.058 --> 00:36:12.928
never mind.

00:36:31.913 --> 00:36:32.913
She's awake.

00:36:34.448 --> 00:36:35.550
Wake up!

00:36:36.484 --> 00:36:37.719
Can you hear me?

00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:43.091
- Where am I?
- I'm here to check on you.

00:36:43.457 --> 00:36:44.559
What?

00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:47.694
Where am I?

00:36:47.828 --> 00:36:49.964
Just relax
so I can check you out.

00:36:50.031 --> 00:36:51.031
No!

00:36:52.234 --> 00:36:53.234
Listen,

00:36:53.634 --> 00:36:54.902
you're gonna do what I say.

00:36:55.303 --> 00:36:58.973
I can make your life very
unpleasant if you don't listen.

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:01.375
Am I clear?

00:37:04.245 --> 00:37:05.647
You don't have to do this.

00:37:08.817 --> 00:37:11.020
Mikhail said
careful with this one.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.290
Are we clear?

00:37:22.029 --> 00:37:23.098
Settle down!

00:37:24.866 --> 00:37:28.236
Calm down
or I put you to sleep again.

00:37:31.638 --> 00:37:33.808
Why are you doing this?

00:37:34.643 --> 00:37:36.978
I have money,
I can get all kinds of money!

00:37:37.044 --> 00:37:39.614
Please,
you don't need to do this!

00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:52.727
Goodnight.

00:38:35.437 --> 00:38:38.573
No, as of right now
we don't have anyone in custody,

00:38:38.707 --> 00:38:40.509
but we're working several leads.

00:38:41.176 --> 00:38:42.878
Excuse me, Mayor Alderman, sir?

00:38:43.111 --> 00:38:45.279
What are you doing
to combat this epidemic?

00:38:45.747 --> 00:38:47.049
We have a task force

00:38:47.482 --> 00:38:52.087
that's, uh, being led by two
of our very best detectives

00:38:52.788 --> 00:38:54.156
and we have four...

00:38:54.989 --> 00:38:57.125
four very good officers
supporting them.

00:38:57.991 --> 00:39:01.095
Excuse me,
I hear another body turned up.

00:39:01.428 --> 00:39:02.797
Can you confirm that?

00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:04.732
Uh...

00:39:11.038 --> 00:39:12.038
Yes...

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.042
unfortunately we've been told

00:39:15.676 --> 00:39:19.780
about, uh, the finding
of a woman's body

00:39:20.147 --> 00:39:23.285
and yet, uh, at this moment
we have no more information.

00:39:24.919 --> 00:39:25.988
Okay, last question.

00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:28.522
There are rumors
surrounding a certain individual

00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:30.091
who both attended and donated

00:39:30.158 --> 00:39:31.960
to your charity
at your last event.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.830
The rumors involve this person
having ties to

00:39:36.531 --> 00:39:38.500
these disappearances. Mr. Mayor,

00:39:39.067 --> 00:39:40.502
are you aware of any ties?

00:39:41.303 --> 00:39:43.005
Well, this is news to me.

00:39:44.538 --> 00:39:46.341
Um, I just want you to know

00:39:46.408 --> 00:39:49.377
I won't turn down any offers
to my charity.

00:39:50.812 --> 00:39:54.616
But to answer your question,
the facts are that

00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:57.217
no, there's... there's no...

00:39:57.884 --> 00:40:00.921
no evidence of any of our donors
in any way

00:40:01.556 --> 00:40:03.926
being associated
to these abductions.

00:40:05.593 --> 00:40:09.263
All right, listen, I appreciate
your questions but I have to go.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.100
<i>I will let the Chief take over.
Thank you.</i>

00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:15.870
That's a good boy.

00:40:18.272 --> 00:40:19.440
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:40:19.707 --> 00:40:20.918
<i>All right, you heard the mayor.</i>

00:40:20.942 --> 00:40:22.811
<i>We'll keep you updated
as we learn more.</i>

00:40:22.877 --> 00:40:24.511
- You did good.
- <i>Trust me,</i>

00:40:24.913 --> 00:40:26.447
we're putting in the resources.

00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:28.583
We will get to the bottom
of this.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:30.185
Thank you for your time.

00:41:00.582 --> 00:41:01.984
Detective.

00:41:03.116 --> 00:41:06.888
I apologize,
but it seems like our cameras

00:41:06.955 --> 00:41:09.257
weren't working
properly last night.

00:41:10.491 --> 00:41:12.060
They weren't working properly?

00:41:12.859 --> 00:41:16.631
Sometimes they short
and we have to reset

00:41:17.098 --> 00:41:19.034
for them to work properly again.

00:41:21.402 --> 00:41:22.402
Huh.

00:41:24.872 --> 00:41:25.973
I mean do you...

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.911
You do realize how
bad that sounds?

00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:32.247
Someone's missing,

00:41:32.848 --> 00:41:35.384
last seen at your club and

00:41:35.716 --> 00:41:39.921
the security system's
conveniently off.

00:41:41.355 --> 00:41:43.690
Look...

00:41:44.491 --> 00:41:47.260
the surveillance system
is to protect my property,

00:41:47.328 --> 00:41:50.532
not to catch women
leaving the club with men,

00:41:50.598 --> 00:41:52.167
leaving their friends behind.

00:41:52.968 --> 00:41:54.902
Are you saying she
left with someone?

00:41:56.504 --> 00:41:57.504
What else?

00:41:59.274 --> 00:42:00.274
I don't know.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:03.410
But...

00:42:03.977 --> 00:42:06.380
it's not like Marie
to just vanish.

00:42:07.614 --> 00:42:09.883
If you know what is like Marie,

00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:12.554
maybe you shouldn't work
the case.

00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:14.388
You're very confident.

00:42:17.058 --> 00:42:20.062
I bet you think you're smarter
than all of us. That...

00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:22.129
you'll get away with this,

00:42:22.529 --> 00:42:24.065
but your days are numbered.

00:42:27.201 --> 00:42:30.205
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Detective?

00:42:32.473 --> 00:42:33.473
No...

00:42:33.975 --> 00:42:36.011
I think I have everything
that I need.

00:42:37.645 --> 00:42:39.014
See the detective out.

00:42:40.247 --> 00:42:42.350
I can show myself out. Thanks.

00:42:43.417 --> 00:42:44.417
Okay.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.640
Hey, what's up?

00:43:07.107 --> 00:43:08.376
<i>It's him, Mikhail.</i>

00:43:09.343 --> 00:43:10.343
What?

00:43:10.946 --> 00:43:12.779
He had some footage
from outside the club.

00:43:13.114 --> 00:43:15.316
<i>He said the cameras
sometimes glitch.</i>

00:43:15.982 --> 00:43:17.484
And I take it
you don't buy that?

00:43:17.585 --> 00:43:20.054
Not for a minute.

00:43:20.355 --> 00:43:23.358
<i>He was enjoying it.
I'm gonna put this fucker away.</i>

00:43:24.024 --> 00:43:25.126
I hear you.

00:43:25.692 --> 00:43:26.794
We have to be careful.

00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:29.029
One screw-up and he could walk.

00:43:29.364 --> 00:43:32.434
Yeah, I know.
Look, I need to tell the mayor.

00:43:33.902 --> 00:43:35.003
Okay.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.174
It hasn't been that long, Mayor.

00:43:41.808 --> 00:43:45.279
I still remember not having to
lock our doors when I grew up.

00:43:45.946 --> 00:43:47.048
Please...

00:43:48.515 --> 00:43:50.084
this reality is now...

00:43:51.451 --> 00:43:54.388
and it's not happening just
here, it's happening everywhere.

00:43:54.455 --> 00:43:57.925
I don't care about everywhere
else. I care about here!

00:43:57.993 --> 00:44:00.594
- I understand, sir.
- Do you?

00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:03.931
My daughter's best
friend is missing.

00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:06.667
She's been gone
for over two weeks

00:44:06.734 --> 00:44:08.636
and she's not the only one!

00:44:08.703 --> 00:44:11.672
- What's it gonna take?
- Listen, sir

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:14.308
I've activated a task force

00:44:14.975 --> 00:44:17.278
with a specific focus
on trafficking

00:44:17.978 --> 00:44:19.881
and it has my full support.

00:44:20.649 --> 00:44:24.551
The two detectives? How is that
gonna change anything?

00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:28.156
Each of those officers
are the very best.

00:44:29.022 --> 00:44:31.026
And together, believe me...

00:44:31.725 --> 00:44:34.428
they're much better than none.
And they have the support

00:44:34.495 --> 00:44:37.364
of four,
four experienced officers

00:44:37.598 --> 00:44:40.736
who also have the support
of our full force.

00:44:41.301 --> 00:44:42.002
Please!

00:44:42.303 --> 00:44:43.337
That's not good enough.

00:44:43.404 --> 00:44:46.041
We're losing our daughters here,
sir!

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:48.542
Good.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.446
You'll have to excuse me
I have to take care

00:44:52.513 --> 00:44:55.716
- of some other business, please.
- Look at these girls!

00:44:56.551 --> 00:44:57.552
Look at them!

00:44:58.085 --> 00:44:59.386
What is it gonna take?

00:44:59.921 --> 00:45:03.357
Does it have to be one of yours
for you to take this seriously?

00:45:04.426 --> 00:45:06.161
I am sorry, sir.

00:45:07.728 --> 00:45:08.763
I'm so sorry.

00:45:10.364 --> 00:45:11.732
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.

00:45:12.232 --> 00:45:14.169
But I think the
Russians took her.

00:45:17.672 --> 00:45:18.672
What?

00:45:19.306 --> 00:45:21.642
It's just too many things
not adding up.

00:45:23.143 --> 00:45:25.645
Look, I'll update you
with more details, but,

00:45:26.013 --> 00:45:28.116
after meeting with Mikhail
and finding out

00:45:28.183 --> 00:45:29.984
that the outside footage
is missing

00:45:30.051 --> 00:45:32.687
from a perfectly good
surveillance system,

00:45:33.053 --> 00:45:34.588
I've determined
that it's likely them,

00:45:34.656 --> 00:45:37.125
- or they're in on it.
- Listen, Sandra.

00:45:38.125 --> 00:45:39.361
You have to find her.

00:45:40.995 --> 00:45:42.431
You know what these animals,

00:45:43.464 --> 00:45:45.634
you know what these animals do
to girls.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.700
I know.

00:45:48.035 --> 00:45:49.136
I'm on it.

00:45:52.439 --> 00:45:55.076
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Just find her!

00:46:00.982 --> 00:46:02.250
Damn.

00:46:27.408 --> 00:46:29.343
- This is her?
- Yes, that's her.

00:46:29.843 --> 00:46:32.946
- But, she's not blond.
- Look, blond.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.549
It's colored,
her roots are dark.

00:46:36.683 --> 00:46:39.821
For 10,000 dollars
you don't get genuine blond.

00:46:39.888 --> 00:46:40.922
You know this.

00:46:41.256 --> 00:46:44.225
- But, seriously, we...
- We'll take her.

00:46:46.493 --> 00:46:48.229
Do you have any
higher end girls?

00:46:48.629 --> 00:46:49.629
Maybe younger?

00:46:50.897 --> 00:46:52.866
Of course, how young?

00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:56.138
Teens, virgins? Let's say...

00:46:56.904 --> 00:46:57.904
100,000 dollars?

00:47:06.247 --> 00:47:08.450
I'm sure we can find
something you'll like.

00:47:10.084 --> 00:47:11.218
Get this one ready.

00:47:11.652 --> 00:47:14.556
Let me see what else we have.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:31.572
- You're sure it's him?
- <i>Who else?</i>

00:47:31.772 --> 00:47:34.808
And even if he didn't,
I'm sure he's connected.

00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:36.109
- I'm certain.
- <i>Oh.</i>

00:47:36.743 --> 00:47:38.912
Any chance he'll give
her up if he has her?

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.181
I doubt it,

00:47:40.881 --> 00:47:42.450
maybe just to save his own skin.

00:47:42.884 --> 00:47:46.254
Uh, if I go poking at Mr. Stone
I need backup.

00:47:47.455 --> 00:47:50.792
It's a higher risk
engagement, so to speak.

00:47:50.859 --> 00:47:51.859
Whatever you need.

00:47:52.426 --> 00:47:54.094
<i>It's my daughter,
for Christ's sake!</i>

00:47:54.696 --> 00:47:57.265
Enough to at least get
someone to watch my back.

00:47:57.631 --> 00:47:58.732
Ideally, two.

00:47:59.567 --> 00:48:01.802
But it's not gonna be
cheap or easy to find them.

00:48:02.002 --> 00:48:03.970
Like I said, whatever you need.

00:48:04.272 --> 00:48:05.406
All right...

00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.841
if I had about a quarter,
I'd be set.

00:48:08.009 --> 00:48:09.009
<i>You got it.</i>

00:48:10.076 --> 00:48:12.078
All right, well,
let me make a few calls

00:48:12.145 --> 00:48:14.448
and, uh, don't worry, I'm on it.

00:48:14.547 --> 00:48:15.547
Good.

00:48:17.652 --> 00:48:18.652
Good.

00:48:31.799 --> 00:48:32.799
Hey, you.

00:48:35.904 --> 00:48:36.904
Come here.

00:48:38.839 --> 00:48:39.839
<i>Nyet.</i>

00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:42.741
Please.

00:48:47.214 --> 00:48:48.683
Please talk to me.

00:48:49.651 --> 00:48:52.353
We both noticed each
other at the club.

00:48:58.493 --> 00:48:59.728
Noticed each other?

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.331
Yeah.

00:49:08.268 --> 00:49:09.370
Just...

00:49:10.937 --> 00:49:12.506
help me outta here and, uh,

00:49:13.808 --> 00:49:15.010
I'll take care of you.

00:49:17.578 --> 00:49:19.047
That's not going to happen.

00:49:22.417 --> 00:49:24.919
Let me out of these
for a little bit?

00:49:28.922 --> 00:49:29.922
Why?

00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:33.794
So, I can show you.

00:49:53.348 --> 00:49:54.549
Show me what?

00:49:57.051 --> 00:49:58.051
Something.

00:50:02.656 --> 00:50:05.392
I have... I have a thing
for tough guys like you.

00:50:20.007 --> 00:50:21.475
Better?

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:24.710
Better.

00:50:27.982 --> 00:50:29.017
So show me.

00:50:46.201 --> 00:50:47.435
What's gonna happen?

00:50:48.368 --> 00:50:50.437
I just wish we could leave.

00:50:50.971 --> 00:50:51.971
Well, we can't...

00:50:52.939 --> 00:50:54.107
so come on.

00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:55.609
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:50:56.343 --> 00:50:57.444
Okay.

00:51:08.489 --> 00:51:09.657
Okay, get in.

00:51:10.825 --> 00:51:11.826
What's going on?

00:51:12.259 --> 00:51:14.396
I just asked for water.

00:51:15.263 --> 00:51:16.797
Don't be stupid, Marie.

00:51:17.131 --> 00:51:18.131
Be good,

00:51:18.698 --> 00:51:20.401
or you will end up dead
in a ditch

00:51:20.667 --> 00:51:22.469
after they all take a turn
on you.

00:51:24.939 --> 00:51:26.408
- Karpov!
- <i>Da?</i>

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.276
Don't fuck this up!

00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:32.113
Or I swear I will have Mikhail
use you as shark bait

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.748
the next time he goes fishing!

00:51:34.147 --> 00:51:35.147
What?

00:51:35.183 --> 00:51:38.085
And keep your little
worm in your pants, okay?

00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:15.223
Eight ball, corner pocket.

00:52:25.265 --> 00:52:26.265
Fuck.

00:52:28.236 --> 00:52:29.236
You hustled me!

00:52:29.337 --> 00:52:30.971
And I ain't paying nobody
to play me!

00:52:31.337 --> 00:52:37.010
Listen, never touch my clothes.
In fact, never touch me, period.

00:52:37.745 --> 00:52:40.614
- Am I clear?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:40.681 --> 00:52:43.785
Now use your other hand
and give me my money.

00:52:53.761 --> 00:52:55.196
What can I get for you?

00:53:14.681 --> 00:53:16.850
- Talk to me.
- <i>I need you.</i>

00:53:18.218 --> 00:53:24.658
And his opponent, you all
know him, still undefeated,

00:53:24.959 --> 00:53:28.428
a man who goes by one name only.

00:53:28.863 --> 00:53:34.835
Here is Alpha!

00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:50.018
Again, a man who goes by
one name only.

00:53:50.417 --> 00:53:56.557
Here is Alpha!

00:54:01.828 --> 00:54:03.064
Gentlemen, center.

00:54:05.031 --> 00:54:09.002
One of the rules of locker room,
there are no rules. Separate.

00:54:12.239 --> 00:54:13.239
Let's fight!

00:54:18.745 --> 00:54:21.848
Let's fight!

00:54:22.149 --> 00:54:23.151
Oh!

00:55:03.623 --> 00:55:04.835
Can we subpoena
the video cameras

00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:06.393
and see if they were tampered
with?

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.660
We can.

00:55:07.962 --> 00:55:09.263
- Then we should.
- Yeah.

00:55:11.998 --> 00:55:13.875
I just don't understand
how they could have snatched her

00:55:13.899 --> 00:55:15.335
right from under your nose.

00:55:20.973 --> 00:55:22.910
It must have been in
the commotion with Brad.

00:55:25.846 --> 00:55:28.882
I saw Kovalchek leave with
one of his goons in a van.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:31.152
It was a windowless white van.

00:55:31.986 --> 00:55:32.986
All right,

00:55:33.187 --> 00:55:35.622
we can check gas stations
with road views on either side,

00:55:35.689 --> 00:55:37.058
see if we can get a plate.

00:55:38.058 --> 00:55:40.128
Or stake it out,
see if it comes back.

00:55:41.027 --> 00:55:42.038
Yeah, we could stake out
the club

00:55:42.062 --> 00:55:43.665
and see if it pops up again.

00:55:44.464 --> 00:55:45.464
Yeah.

00:55:46.033 --> 00:55:48.969
- Let's check in with Chief.
- Good idea, let's go.

00:55:51.404 --> 00:55:53.040
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?

00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:54.341
We have something.

00:55:55.375 --> 00:55:56.375
All right, talk to me.

00:55:56.643 --> 00:55:59.083
We should be able to subpoena
the video with a search warrant.

00:55:59.312 --> 00:56:01.614
Let me see if I can get
Judge Reinhold on the phone.

00:56:02.149 --> 00:56:04.786
Also, I saw a white
windowless van leave the scene.

00:56:05.386 --> 00:56:06.386
Can we put out an APB?

00:56:06.654 --> 00:56:09.323
Why don't you stake the place
out and see if they come again?

00:56:09.489 --> 00:56:10.491
Let's do both.

00:56:11.058 --> 00:56:13.261
- All right, sounds good.
- Thanks, Chief.

00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:14.862
Yep.

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:20.700
All right,

00:56:20.968 --> 00:56:22.808
I'll check the parking lot,
you check the club.

00:56:23.102 --> 00:56:24.102
Okay.

00:56:37.884 --> 00:56:38.986
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:56:42.689 --> 00:56:44.958
Uh, sorry I was so short
last night.

00:56:47.593 --> 00:56:49.329
Your boss wasn't very nice.

00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:52.132
It's fine, I understand.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.502
And thanks for stepping in
with Brad.

00:56:55.969 --> 00:56:58.105
It's okay, just doing my job.

00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.210
Can I buy you a drink?

00:57:03.777 --> 00:57:05.946
Uh, sure.

00:57:08.982 --> 00:57:11.352
So, how did you end up
with these guys?

00:57:11.785 --> 00:57:13.853
What, how did I end up
with the owner

00:57:13.921 --> 00:57:15.756
and the crew managing this bar?

00:57:16.957 --> 00:57:18.159
You know what I mean.

00:57:19.727 --> 00:57:20.727
It's a good gig.

00:57:21.462 --> 00:57:24.966
Mikhail, he, he looked
after me for a while.

00:57:26.466 --> 00:57:29.136
He was friends with my dad
when he passed, and...

00:57:30.571 --> 00:57:33.140
my mom, she OD'd
a few years earlier, so,

00:57:33.806 --> 00:57:36.209
I was on the streets
fending for myself.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:38.310
When he found out...

00:57:39.446 --> 00:57:40.446
he took me in.

00:57:42.015 --> 00:57:43.382
But now he's using you.

00:57:43.917 --> 00:57:46.888
Your chief uses you
like any boss uses an employee.

00:57:47.821 --> 00:57:49.123
What's the difference?

00:57:51.625 --> 00:57:53.094
You're smarter than that.

00:57:54.495 --> 00:57:57.031
You know the difference
between right and wrong

00:57:57.096 --> 00:57:59.700
and a false sense of loyalty

00:57:59.765 --> 00:58:02.068
has you working
against who you are.

00:58:03.669 --> 00:58:04.938
What do you want me to say?

00:58:05.705 --> 00:58:06.705
How I feel stuck?

00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:09.375
Or how I regret crossing
to the dark side?

00:58:09.442 --> 00:58:12.513
Or how I live in fear?
Something like that?

00:58:15.147 --> 00:58:16.517
I'm gonna tell you something.

00:58:18.252 --> 00:58:21.488
There's no dark side,
there's no light side.

00:58:22.055 --> 00:58:23.357
There's just shades of gray.

00:58:32.031 --> 00:58:33.600
Well, I'd like you on my side.

00:58:35.736 --> 00:58:36.837
Shade of gray.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.375
You seem like a good man.

00:58:45.245 --> 00:58:46.245
No?

00:58:46.547 --> 00:58:48.282
That about it, detective?

00:58:50.517 --> 00:58:51.517
I guess so.

00:58:52.652 --> 00:58:53.955
It's on the house, by the way.

00:59:13.908 --> 00:59:15.009
Anything?

00:59:15.808 --> 00:59:17.577
Nope, not a thing.

00:59:19.446 --> 00:59:20.446
You?

00:59:20.647 --> 00:59:21.647
Nada.

00:59:30.524 --> 00:59:31.524
Hey, man.

00:59:37.665 --> 00:59:39.033
How's business?

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.102
Business is good, as always.

00:59:42.569 --> 00:59:43.569
That detective...

00:59:44.971 --> 00:59:46.274
she came by again.

00:59:50.277 --> 00:59:52.913
- Don't worry about her.
- I'm not, they just left.

00:59:54.348 --> 00:59:56.250
Karpov, go check if
they're still here.

00:59:56.982 --> 00:59:57.982
They left.

00:59:58.118 --> 01:00:00.187
- Check anyways.
- All right.

01:00:04.091 --> 01:00:05.259
What did she say?

01:00:06.259 --> 01:00:07.727
I don't think
they have anything,

01:00:08.161 --> 01:00:10.598
but she seems pretty determined
it's you who took her.

01:00:15.402 --> 01:00:17.504
The baggage will be gone
tomorrow.

01:00:18.272 --> 01:00:19.272
That's good.

01:00:48.468 --> 01:00:49.468
Welcome.

01:00:49.837 --> 01:00:54.075
Hey, you, wake up!

01:01:00.913 --> 01:01:02.049
Fuck you.

01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:05.753
I was trying to be nice.

01:01:09.388 --> 01:01:10.388
Okay.

01:01:12.359 --> 01:01:13.359
Here we go.

01:01:15.495 --> 01:01:16.495
First question.

01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:20.767
Did you take
Mayor Alderman's daughter?

01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:26.207
I took your mother.

01:01:34.814 --> 01:01:36.416
I'll ask you one more time.

01:01:38.518 --> 01:01:40.421
Did you take the
Mayor's daughter?

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:45.325
Fuck you.

01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:51.832
Is that the best you've got?

01:01:52.098 --> 01:01:53.533
What do you think, I'm a cop?

01:01:57.603 --> 01:01:59.105
You think I have rules?

01:02:02.709 --> 01:02:03.709
Cash.

01:02:20.893 --> 01:02:23.263
Kill me, I'm not talking.

01:02:23.864 --> 01:02:25.199
Where's the fun in that?

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.275
Fuck you!

01:02:34.674 --> 01:02:36.343
Nails grow back.

01:02:38.645 --> 01:02:40.181
We're not finished yet.

01:02:42.116 --> 01:02:43.217
Where is she?

01:02:44.884 --> 01:02:46.687
In your mother's bed.

01:02:48.388 --> 01:02:50.324
After I fucked them both...

01:02:51.558 --> 01:02:55.228
- they needed the rest.
- This guy's a real dirt bag.

01:02:58.899 --> 01:02:59.899
Level two.

01:03:00.399 --> 01:03:04.270
Level two, now I'm scared.

01:03:16.716 --> 01:03:18.484
I'll take it to the grave.

01:03:18.652 --> 01:03:21.322
See, I know you're in
a hurry to get there...

01:03:22.756 --> 01:03:23.891
but if you don't talk...

01:03:25.859 --> 01:03:27.795
I can make this last forever.

01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:31.931
Okay.

01:03:34.533 --> 01:03:36.436
Let's try this one more time.

01:03:39.105 --> 01:03:40.607
Hey, you know what, Cash?

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:43.144
He don't look ready.

01:03:44.477 --> 01:03:47.313
Why don't you take another
one before I ask him again?

01:03:48.082 --> 01:03:49.183
Pleasure.

01:05:10.296 --> 01:05:14.368
Help. Help me, please!
Help me!

01:05:14.801 --> 01:05:17.471
Please, save me.

01:05:18.672 --> 01:05:20.808
No!

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:22.977
No!

01:05:24.578 --> 01:05:25.613
No!

01:05:26.312 --> 01:05:28.448
Please, save me.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.528
Where's Karpov?

01:05:43.096 --> 01:05:44.465
I don't think he's here.

01:05:44.897 --> 01:05:45.932
Go find him.

01:05:46.767 --> 01:05:47.767
All right.

01:06:05.852 --> 01:06:06.852
I can't find him.

01:06:08.488 --> 01:06:10.256
What you mean
you can't find him?

01:06:10.623 --> 01:06:12.593
I mean I can't find him,
he's not here.

01:06:27.507 --> 01:06:31.844
Oh, what do we got here?

01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:35.647
Hello?

01:06:36.116 --> 01:06:37.116
Who is this?

01:06:37.283 --> 01:06:40.219
I'm just babysitting this phone.
Who are you?

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.822
<i>Listen motherfucker,</i>

01:06:41.888 --> 01:06:43.857
<i>you put Karpov on the phone
right now.</i>

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:46.393
Okay.

01:06:47.294 --> 01:06:48.795
Hey Karpov...

01:06:49.596 --> 01:06:51.864
you got a phone call.
I think it's your boss.

01:06:52.332 --> 01:06:53.500
I'm all right.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.536
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

01:06:56.468 --> 01:06:58.571
Actually, he's not doing so hot.

01:07:00.339 --> 01:07:03.609
Look, I will find you
and when I find you

01:07:03.676 --> 01:07:05.511
I will cut you up
into little pieces, you p...

01:07:05.578 --> 01:07:08.015
Hey, shut up and listen
for a second!

01:07:10.283 --> 01:07:11.551
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:07:12.919 --> 01:07:13.919
Simple.

01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:18.090
I trade you one barely alive
Russian piece of shit

01:07:18.457 --> 01:07:19.926
for the mayor's daughter.

01:07:22.328 --> 01:07:24.864
- What?
- <i>Better hurry it up.</i>

01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.801
He's not gonna be alive
much longer.

01:07:31.103 --> 01:07:34.375
Fuck you, you can have him.
I have lots of Karpovs.

01:07:38.444 --> 01:07:40.080
I think you just got fired.

01:07:43.382 --> 01:07:45.018
So you're just gonna let them
kill him?

01:07:45.718 --> 01:07:48.888
- He's as good as dead.
- But he's not dead yet!

01:07:50.556 --> 01:07:52.825
He is already dead!

01:07:55.294 --> 01:07:56.462
Fuck!

01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:00.834
What the fuck you looking at?

01:08:21.087 --> 01:08:22.956
Oh, my God, she's gone!

01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:26.626
Bring her to me!

01:08:30.197 --> 01:08:31.899
- She's gone!
- <i>What?</i>

01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.334
Marie is gone!

01:08:35.234 --> 01:08:37.270
<i>And there
was another drive-by...</i>

01:08:41.373 --> 01:08:43.544
- Yeah?
- She got out.

01:08:44.144 --> 01:08:45.144
<i>What?</i>

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:48.315
She got out.
I don't know how, but...

01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:53.019
she couldn't have made it far.
Well, I think you should know.

01:08:57.023 --> 01:08:59.960
The mayor, yeah,
talk to the mayor for me.

01:09:00.559 --> 01:09:01.861
Where's your daughter?

01:09:03.063 --> 01:09:04.564
Fuck.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:07.066
<i>Found last week in the river...</i>

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:13.005
Yeah, that's right.

01:09:18.812 --> 01:09:21.915
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, go check on my credit.

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:24.151
Jack, you stay here.

01:09:57.416 --> 01:09:59.252
Come on, Stone,
you're smarter than that.

01:10:09.429 --> 01:10:10.531
Does that hurt?

01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:13.099
Yeah, it looks painful.

01:10:18.938 --> 01:10:19.938
You know...

01:10:20.273 --> 01:10:23.176
I wonder how long it would take
you to bleed to death?

01:10:24.676 --> 01:10:28.081
I'd say five hours, maybe six.

01:10:28.982 --> 01:10:34.254
Without help, without care,
you're a dead man.

01:10:37.723 --> 01:10:40.993
What do you want from me, hmm?

01:10:42.795 --> 01:10:44.698
Where's the mayor's daughter?

01:10:45.697 --> 01:10:47.232
School? I don't know!

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.604
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:10:54.273 --> 01:10:55.642
Wrong answer.

01:11:07.086 --> 01:11:08.086
Mom?

01:11:10.322 --> 01:11:11.322
Mom?

01:11:11.357 --> 01:11:13.792
Sandra, Sandra!

01:11:13.859 --> 01:11:16.728
- Oh, shit, shh!
- Sandra, don't let them find me.

01:11:16.996 --> 01:11:20.000
There's no one here,
let's get you home.

01:11:23.536 --> 01:11:26.006
I give up, don't shoot!

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:28.675
I'm unarmed.

01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:31.077
Come slowly towards me

01:11:31.211 --> 01:11:33.180
with your hands on top
of your head.

01:11:48.428 --> 01:11:50.162
Just give me the location.

01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:51.898
It'll be over.

01:11:52.331 --> 01:11:53.366
I'm bleeding out.

01:11:55.234 --> 01:11:57.004
I'll be gone soon anyway.

01:11:58.304 --> 01:11:59.772
Ah, I can fix that.

01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:11.282
See?

01:12:11.585 --> 01:12:12.919
Now we have time.

01:12:14.586 --> 01:12:16.756
We just went from hours left...

01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:19.992
to several days,
maybe even weeks.

01:12:21.995 --> 01:12:23.663
But if I get the address...

01:12:24.764 --> 01:12:26.800
I'll put a bullet in your head
and it's over.

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:31.270
Yeah, a big part of me really
wants...

01:12:32.272 --> 01:12:33.372
you to reveal it...

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.709
but the other part of me...

01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:37.541
is curious.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.446
How long will you last?

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.949
Hey, pretty elaborate, isn't it?

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:46.152
So what do you say?

01:12:46.486 --> 01:12:48.087
Address or this?

01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:50.089
I am curious

01:12:50.555 --> 01:12:52.291
so I don't mind giving this
a try.

01:12:54.559 --> 01:12:56.696
Oh, the strong, silent type.

01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:00.100
Okay, Cash...

01:13:01.267 --> 01:13:02.736
give him a little taste.

01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:10.844
All right, enough.

01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:16.249
You already know,

01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:19.119
I won't talk so...

01:13:21.854 --> 01:13:23.255
Let's end this.

01:13:23.922 --> 01:13:25.492
No, no, no, no. Don't you see?

01:13:25.992 --> 01:13:27.560
That's the beauty of this.

01:13:27.827 --> 01:13:29.896
You decide how much pain
there will be.

01:13:31.063 --> 01:13:33.032
I've offered you a way out.

01:13:34.867 --> 01:13:36.937
Look at me.

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.110
I don't know...

01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:45.245
where it is.

01:13:47.179 --> 01:13:48.179
That's it.

01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:51.416
The truth...

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.921
is closer to you
than your breath.

01:14:01.693 --> 01:14:02.693
Hit him up.

01:14:08.734 --> 01:14:09.835
Now...

01:14:11.104 --> 01:14:13.273
why don't you tell
the big, bad wolf...

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.443
what he needs to hear?

01:14:18.144 --> 01:14:20.013
Looks like I get two for one.

01:14:25.984 --> 01:14:27.554
Pretty for a detective.

01:14:34.859 --> 01:14:37.531
Don't even fucking touch me,
you pig!

01:14:38.163 --> 01:14:40.132
Did you radio your location?

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:42.269
Fuck you!

01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:48.107
Don't you fucking touch her!

01:14:54.915 --> 01:14:57.082
You're already dead
and you don't even know it.

01:14:57.215 --> 01:14:58.550
Fuck you!

01:15:03.089 --> 01:15:07.593
- Did you radio your location?
- Don't you fucking touch...

01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:18.104
Let's relocate.

01:15:20.639 --> 01:15:22.209
You better not be lying.

01:15:28.346 --> 01:15:29.346
Liar,

01:15:30.448 --> 01:15:32.518
liar, liar, liar.

01:15:33.653 --> 01:15:35.055
Liar, I'm a...

01:15:36.355 --> 01:15:38.224
liar.

01:15:43.763 --> 01:15:45.098
Liar, liar...

01:15:45.864 --> 01:15:48.033
pants on fire.

01:15:59.377 --> 01:16:00.377
Look at you.

01:16:02.948 --> 01:16:04.951
You should have
chosen more wisely.

01:16:05.451 --> 01:16:06.653
Carlos.

01:16:08.086 --> 01:16:11.156
Nice to see you, Carlos.

01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:13.660
It's not too late.

01:16:14.861 --> 01:16:15.961
Join me...

01:16:16.562 --> 01:16:17.663
and I let you go.

01:16:22.268 --> 01:16:23.470
No, no, no.

01:16:25.237 --> 01:16:26.237
No?

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:29.442
I'm not joining you.

01:16:36.381 --> 01:16:37.917
I decided.

01:16:39.751 --> 01:16:40.751
I

01:16:41.053 --> 01:16:44.157
Don't want...

01:16:45.190 --> 01:16:46.190
Okay.

01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:51.630
Oh, a gun?

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:54.332
Bye, bye.

01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:13.987
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

01:17:14.854 --> 01:17:16.723
I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:17:16.822 --> 01:17:17.957
Just trust me.

01:17:18.523 --> 01:17:19.591
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:17:24.663 --> 01:17:25.743
I'm getting you outta here.

01:17:26.232 --> 01:17:27.701
I'm getting you all outta here.

01:17:39.144 --> 01:17:42.614
It's okay, he's on our side.

01:17:42.814 --> 01:17:44.183
You gotta be quiet. Okay?

01:17:45.917 --> 01:17:47.197
I'm getting you outta here,
okay?

01:17:47.286 --> 01:17:49.206
- I'm getting you outta here.
- He's on our side.

01:17:51.157 --> 01:17:52.525
He's getting us out of here.

01:17:53.859 --> 01:17:56.228
Shh, it's okay.

01:18:06.871 --> 01:18:09.308
I got you, okay, shh!

01:18:10.343 --> 01:18:11.944
I'm getting you
outta here, okay?

01:18:12.711 --> 01:18:16.015
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
All right. It's gonna be okay.

01:18:21.287 --> 01:18:22.287
Okay.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.028
Come here, okay.

01:18:42.575 --> 01:18:43.575
Hey, man.

01:18:45.077 --> 01:18:46.211
Everything's good out there?

01:18:46.412 --> 01:18:48.322
Yeah, they're just getting
the bodies out of the way.

01:18:48.346 --> 01:18:49.515
So they're out there now?

01:18:49.948 --> 01:18:51.228
No, I think
they're dumping them.

01:18:51.517 --> 01:18:53.919
Okay, let's hope that's it
and no more are coming, right?

01:18:54.153 --> 01:18:56.356
Yeah, man, no shit.

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:27.487
- I'm not leaving you, Jessie!
- Please, go.

01:19:28.987 --> 01:19:30.255
I want you to live!

01:19:30.322 --> 01:19:32.924
- We gotta go now!
- No, I'm not leaving her!

01:19:32.992 --> 01:19:35.495
Do you wanna fucking die here?
Come on!

01:19:45.403 --> 01:19:46.872
Wait, wait,
wait something's wrong!

01:19:47.572 --> 01:19:49.174
We don't have time for this!

01:19:50.108 --> 01:19:53.112
We gotta move!

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.120
Listen up,

01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:05.358
these bastards will be locked
and loaded on their home turf.

01:20:06.591 --> 01:20:07.594
Watch your sixes.

01:20:08.961 --> 01:20:10.295
We work together...

01:20:10.929 --> 01:20:11.929
as one.

01:20:12.598 --> 01:20:13.598
Hell, yeah.

01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:16.135
- Team work.
- Yeah, there's no I in team.

01:20:16.835 --> 01:20:18.638
- Semper fi.
- That's right.

01:20:22.407 --> 01:20:23.508
Move the other girls.

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:26.010
We need to get out of here
as soon as possible.

01:20:26.111 --> 01:20:27.313
Okay, boss, where you going?

01:20:27.712 --> 01:20:30.750
- I need to take care of things.
- Remember, they can be off IV's

01:20:30.817 --> 01:20:34.019
for maybe an hour before
they start clearing up. Okay?

01:20:34.086 --> 01:20:35.288
See you at back up.

01:20:37.255 --> 01:20:38.490
If you see Darryl,

01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:40.192
I want him alive.

01:20:55.107 --> 01:20:56.242
I can't do this.

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:58.910
What?

01:20:59.245 --> 01:21:00.412
But you helped us.

01:21:00.712 --> 01:21:03.014
Of course,
we're not gonna turn you in!

01:21:03.181 --> 01:21:04.649
No, you see,

01:21:04.716 --> 01:21:07.319
I don't think I can stay out
of Mikhail's reach.

01:21:08.386 --> 01:21:10.523
I gotta do this the only way
I know how.

01:21:11.823 --> 01:21:12.892
What do you mean?

01:21:14.326 --> 01:21:15.528
I gotta face him.

01:21:17.729 --> 01:21:20.866
- That's suicide, Darryl.
- Turning myself in is suicide.

01:21:21.132 --> 01:21:22.132
Come on.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:26.906
- We have programs that...
- Sandra, you know what I mean!

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.509
You know how our world works.

01:21:31.344 --> 01:21:32.784
I'm gonna be looking
over my shoulder

01:21:32.845 --> 01:21:34.614
for the rest of my life.

01:21:37.382 --> 01:21:39.618
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be short lived.

01:21:40.586 --> 01:21:41.653
Sandra...

01:21:43.288 --> 01:21:44.623
can't they help him?

01:21:55.134 --> 01:21:56.336
He's right.

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.308
I hate to say it,
but he's right.

01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:40.812
Go to the car.

01:22:52.791 --> 01:22:54.326
This is your loyalty?

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:56.234
Don't you fucking talk to me
about loyalty

01:22:56.295 --> 01:22:58.130
after you let them kill Karpov!

01:22:58.563 --> 01:22:59.831
He was already dead.

01:23:00.765 --> 01:23:02.902
You really think
they would let him go?

01:23:03.301 --> 01:23:04.670
You should have traded!

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.471
We would all be dead.

01:23:07.706 --> 01:23:08.706
Listen to me.

01:23:09.442 --> 01:23:11.477
I'm out, okay?

01:23:11.743 --> 01:23:14.346
What do you want, my blessing?

01:23:15.747 --> 01:23:16.747
I want your word,

01:23:16.814 --> 01:23:18.651
that if I help you
take these guys out

01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:20.094
I don't have to look
over my shoulder

01:23:20.118 --> 01:23:22.086
for the rest of my life
wondering if I'm gonna be

01:23:22.153 --> 01:23:23.755
at the receiving end
of your gun.

01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:32.431
Okay, deal.

01:23:36.734 --> 01:23:37.734
I trust you.

01:23:40.406 --> 01:23:42.108
Time I go see this mayor.

01:23:43.309 --> 01:23:44.309
Okay...

01:23:44.609 --> 01:23:45.745
I'll check on Stone.

01:23:57.488 --> 01:23:58.991
They're on their way.

01:24:00.858 --> 01:24:01.858
Good.

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:03.595
How you feeling?

01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:05.898
I don't feel so hot.

01:24:09.635 --> 01:24:10.635
You?

01:24:12.237 --> 01:24:14.940
I feel sick,

01:24:15.808 --> 01:24:16.808
drained.

01:24:19.611 --> 01:24:22.448
Where is she? Marie!

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:26.886
- Dad!
- Marie, sweetie!

01:24:27.452 --> 01:24:28.588
Sweetie, I'm here!

01:24:29.255 --> 01:24:30.355
Are you okay?

01:24:30.589 --> 01:24:33.859
Oh, poor baby!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry!

01:24:36.761 --> 01:24:37.761
How is it?

01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:41.834
Are you in pain?
Sweetie, you okay? Is it...

01:24:43.268 --> 01:24:44.404
Oh, God.

01:24:50.242 --> 01:24:51.343
Did we get them yet?

01:24:51.577 --> 01:24:53.413
No, not yet,
they're on their way.

01:24:53.679 --> 01:24:54.679
Yeah?

01:24:54.979 --> 01:24:58.116
I can put every one
of those fuckers in jail

01:24:58.184 --> 01:24:59.619
for their rest of their life!

01:25:00.452 --> 01:25:03.488
But I want you to take him out.
Do you understand?

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:05.690
Do you understand?

01:25:10.996 --> 01:25:11.996
Chief?

01:25:12.031 --> 01:25:14.632
- Yeah?
- I'd really like to be there.

01:25:15.166 --> 01:25:16.835
No, Sandra, not an option.

01:25:17.736 --> 01:25:19.572
Sir, they killed my partner.

01:25:20.404 --> 01:25:22.541
And I'm not losing
you both tonight!

01:25:22.675 --> 01:25:25.410
You're recovering,
you go home, rest.

01:25:26.245 --> 01:25:29.482
I'd tell you to go to
the hospital, but I know better.

01:25:30.116 --> 01:25:32.484
Go home, I'll keep you updated.

01:25:34.318 --> 01:25:36.221
Hey, can we get outta here?

01:25:36.988 --> 01:25:39.625
Yeah, but she's been drugged.
She needs to be examined.

01:25:39.692 --> 01:25:41.225
I know, I know.
She's got a doctor

01:25:41.292 --> 01:25:42.627
coming to the house,
don't worry.

01:25:42.995 --> 01:25:45.997
- She needs some help.
- Listen, you just take him out!

01:25:49.134 --> 01:25:50.703
I hope that's all she needs.

01:25:54.672 --> 01:25:56.041
Cash, how you feeling?

01:25:57.975 --> 01:25:59.010
I don't know, man.

01:26:00.379 --> 01:26:01.747
I don't like this at all.

01:26:02.715 --> 01:26:04.984
It feels like we're just
sitting ducks out in the open.

01:26:06.419 --> 01:26:07.586
Just breathe.

01:26:08.886 --> 01:26:11.224
Just keep breathing.

01:26:12.491 --> 01:26:13.593
Truth.

01:26:17.528 --> 01:26:18.630
All right...

01:26:19.497 --> 01:26:20.632
let's roll.

01:26:24.135 --> 01:26:25.136
Show time.

01:26:27.072 --> 01:26:28.072
Boom.

01:26:39.684 --> 01:26:42.187
Dr. Spellman said
he'd be here in a few minutes.

01:26:45.389 --> 01:26:46.791
I feel sick.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.196
It's the drugs. You're...

01:26:51.764 --> 01:26:53.866
probably gonna have
a few rough days.

01:26:55.733 --> 01:26:57.068
But you're gonna be okay.

01:26:58.703 --> 01:26:59.904
You're gonna be all right.

01:27:00.872 --> 01:27:04.109
I just wanna wake up
from this nightmare, Dad.

01:27:06.278 --> 01:27:07.278
I understand.

01:27:09.114 --> 01:27:10.550
Hey, you're a champ.

01:27:14.287 --> 01:27:15.588
That's the doc.

01:27:31.903 --> 01:27:35.306
- How dare you fuck with me!
- What are you doing?

01:27:35.773 --> 01:27:37.274
What are you doing?

01:27:37.742 --> 01:27:40.411
- You bring in the cartel!
- What, they pay you more?

01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:42.081
What are you talking about?

01:27:43.715 --> 01:27:47.318
You tell me everything you know
and you tell me now.

01:27:47.385 --> 01:27:48.419
No, please!

01:27:48.519 --> 01:27:50.199
Don't, you know the police
are coming here!

01:27:50.688 --> 01:27:53.357
- You can't stay here!
- Why are you here?

01:27:53.757 --> 01:27:54.926
- No!
- She's a great fuck.

01:27:54.992 --> 01:27:57.263
- Help me!
- Don't you dare!

01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:01.599
- You!
- Now you tell me everything

01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:03.768
or I will fuck her right
in front of you

01:28:03.836 --> 01:28:06.872
and I will tape your eyes open
so you have to watch!

01:28:07.139 --> 01:28:08.174
No, please!

01:28:09.175 --> 01:28:10.175
Please, don't!

01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:11.876
You tell me.

01:28:16.349 --> 01:28:18.017
Last warning.

01:28:19.518 --> 01:28:20.620
God!

01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:26.151
I don't need you anymore.

01:29:26.218 --> 01:29:28.386
I can get you out!
I can stop them!

01:29:28.453 --> 01:29:32.590
I can shut down the cartel!
I can stop the police right now!

01:29:32.791 --> 01:29:35.394
You and her,
you gotta save yourselves!

01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.730
I can help you right now! Don't!

01:29:38.029 --> 01:29:40.398
I convict you of treason, Mayor.

01:29:40.831 --> 01:29:44.102
Oh, my God!

01:30:20.705 --> 01:30:21.806
Cash!

01:30:25.477 --> 01:30:27.747
Freeze!

01:30:34.553 --> 01:30:35.553
Officer...

01:30:36.688 --> 01:30:38.022
we're not with them.

01:30:39.558 --> 01:30:41.493
We're here to get
Marie back safely.

01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:45.397
Well, you're too late.

01:30:46.764 --> 01:30:48.099
She's at home with her father.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.600
That's good.

01:30:51.403 --> 01:30:52.772
You mind if I verify that?

01:30:53.438 --> 01:30:54.438
Go right ahead.

01:30:56.007 --> 01:30:57.443
Keep those guns down.

01:31:12.257 --> 01:31:13.792
Well, no answer.

01:31:22.533 --> 01:31:23.533
Freeze!

01:31:36.715 --> 01:31:39.518
Fuck!

01:31:43.421 --> 01:31:44.656
- Darryl?
- Yeah?

01:31:44.889 --> 01:31:48.324
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.

01:31:49.027 --> 01:31:50.462
I can never trust you again.

01:31:58.903 --> 01:32:01.005
Sounds like you are out
of bullets.

01:32:01.407 --> 01:32:02.875
I count nine.

01:32:03.974 --> 01:32:05.910
Sounds like you don't have
any more either.

01:32:06.612 --> 01:32:09.415
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

01:32:13.117 --> 01:32:14.117
Okay.

01:32:16.688 --> 01:32:17.688
Let's...

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:19.590
find...

01:32:20.759 --> 01:32:22.461
out.

01:32:23.394 --> 01:32:25.129
I am not afraid of you.

01:32:29.033 --> 01:32:30.469
Let's settle this...

01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:33.005
a different way.

01:32:37.843 --> 01:32:41.279
Your muscles make you slow.

01:32:42.147 --> 01:32:45.451
Your lack of
muscles make you weak!

01:33:11.643 --> 01:33:12.643
Jesus, Mikhail...

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.580
you're done.

01:33:19.651 --> 01:33:20.685
It's over!

01:33:22.955 --> 01:33:24.555
The cops are on their way.

01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:27.926
It's done!

01:33:32.096 --> 01:33:34.099
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

01:34:29.153 --> 01:34:30.421
How about a drink?

01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.590
Sounds good.

01:35:17.493 --> 01:35:22.493
