WEBVTT

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.150
This is how war begins.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.719
Athens and Sparta
fought during a plague

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.720
which wiped out
much of the population.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.990
Sound familiar?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.529
But the war brought
only more death and destruction

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.729
because people let their fear,
their honor, their interest

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.330
cloud their judgment.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.539
The Peloponnesian War
may be ancient history,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.780
but its lessons are not.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.879
You here will be the first
graduating class of midshipmen

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.479
to enter the Navy

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.219
since our own troubles ended
just three years ago.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.350
We're in a time of peace,
but peace doesn't keep itself.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.689
Ours is a small navy,
which means...

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.829
your importance to the mission
is even larger.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.560
And you will take
the lessons from history,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.639
both ancient and very recent,
with you as you enter service.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.909
When you put on the uniform,
you can't let your fear

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.840
or your pride
or your selfish interest

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.249
lead you astray, or people die.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.519
We have to think differently
because we<i> are</i> different.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250
We are warriors.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.589
All right, we'll pick it up
after the weekend.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.989
Don't forget your reading.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.329
We're all working
from the same edition,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.329
thanks to our friends
at the Nimitz Library.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.529
We'll discuss the first 100 pages.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.000
Don't worry,
there's lots of pictures.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.970
Attention on deck.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.679
Dismissed.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.410
See you on Monday,
enjoy the big game, go Navy!

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.419
Mr. Swain?
Yes, sir.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.489
How is it my brightest student

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.959
is always the last one
to turn in his assignments?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.030
Sir, I had a last-minute breakthrough.
I wanted to check my numbers.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.360
I'm sorry, sir.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.160
No excuse.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.099
"The Next Virus Will Be Cyber".

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.969
I thought I was done
with viruses.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.439
I hope we are, sir.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.170
Well, I'm docking you one grade
for lateness,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.639
but this is excellent work.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.039
And if you don't mind,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.979
I'd like to hang on to it
for a little bit.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.179
There's some folks at Fleet Command
who'd be interested in your research.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.379
I'd like to share it with them,
with your permission.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.449
Yeah.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.990
Yes, sir. Of course.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.459
Um...

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.199
Do you miss it, sir?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.399
Miss what?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.539
War, sir.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.209
Son, you really ought to
get to my class more often.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.879
I just mean, you retired,
and that's cool and all.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.209
But...

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.279
don't you miss the mission?

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.549
Clarity of purpose?

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.349
I mean, you said it yourself...
We're warriors.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.690
Without a war,
what's a warrior to do?

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.560
Thank you, sir.

You get the tickets?

<i>Sí.</i> No problem,<i> señor.</i>

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.839
I smuggle blue cure into Panama

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.239
two weeks before
the ship showed up.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.969
This?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.570
This was easy.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.040
"You are cordially invited
to the 50th birthday celebration

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.509
of<i> El Presidente</i>
Fernando Asturius.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.350
Black tie preferred."

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.119
You know, it seems odd
<i>El Presidente</i>

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.249
throws a blow-out party

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.220
while the people curse him
in the street.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.789
That's Panama.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.929
<i>El Presidente</i> isn't afraid
of Gustavo Barros

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.459
or his Gran Colombian goons.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.729
Whoever controls
the Panama Canal...

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.060
is king.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.069
And for now,
that man is<i> El Presidente.</i>

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.799
Well, killing<i> El Presidente</i>
would change all that.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.270
You guys are crazy.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.209
What are you,
Defense Intelligence?

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.340
CIA?

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.550
Yeah, you guys are crazy.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.620
<i>Adiós,</i> Marco.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.229
I got to go!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.430
No, I'm going through security.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.839
I'll see you tonight.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.300
I will do the cooking.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.839
You're the best
ever, ever, ever.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.379
And the cutest and the sweetest
and the smartest...

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.449
I got to go!
W-W-Wait!

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.849
I'm sending you
something super important.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.120
Hang on!
Okay.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.659
Did you get it?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.199
I got it.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.130
Now you have it.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.939
You're so weird.
I love you.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.400
I love you.
Bye.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.670
Bye.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.159
Commander Granderson?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.090
Yes, sir.
You're right on time.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.160
Put it up on the big screens.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.039
They made it.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.239
Almost here.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.710
The great fleet.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.049
USS<i> Michener,</i>
this is fleet command.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.249
Come in, over.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.789
<i>This is Zulu Actual.</i>

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.450
<i>It is another beautiful day
at sea.</i>

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.259
<i>As I'm sure
you've been watching,</i>

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.789
<i>we're currently 200 miles north
of naval station Mayport.</i>

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.259
Should be in port
and all tucked in by nightfall.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.059
Ships in the fleet,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.269
why don't you give our friends
in Florida a proper Navy hello?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.669
This is USS<i> Jeffrey Michener</i>
actual.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.739
All systems go.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.400
We have on board
a full complement

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.069
of surface warriors, aviators,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.809
<i>and more Marines
than you can shake a stick at.</i>

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.879
<i>- Over.</i>
<i>- This is USS</i> Oliver<i> actual.</i>

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.279
<i>All systems are go.</i>

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.149
<i>This is</i> Michael O'Connor<i> actual.</i>

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.680
<i>All systems go.</i>

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.289
<i>This is the</i> Javier Cruz<i> actual.</i>

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.489
<i>Smooth sailing.</i>

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.419
Good day, fleet command.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.489
This is<i> Nathan James</i> actual.
All systems go.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.889
We are ready and proud

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.960
to no longer be
the only ship in the fleet.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.369
Ships of the fleet,
your route is clear.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.169
We wish you fair winds
and following seas.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.239
Much obliged, Master Chief.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.570
It's a great day for the Navy

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.040
and the red, white, and blue.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.780
This is Zulu actual out.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.319
We're up a touchdown,
but it's early.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.259
Take nothing for granted.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.860
Army's got a ground game for once.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.729
What time's your flight?
Couple hours.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.799
You pack your whites?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.300
It's hot in Florida,
even in December.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.400
Sam moved out, Sasha.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.739
He wants to live with Ashley
in St. Louis.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.079
I know.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.340
I spoke with Ashley last week.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.879
Oh, great,
so I'm the last to know?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.349
They have a great school there,
they have continuity.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.749
Don't take it personally.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.349
How can I not?

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.089
It's just easier for them.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.689
They're used to you
not being there full-time.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.019
What do you mean?!

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.959
I've been here full time
for the last three years.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.229
Not in your head.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.029
I'm sorry.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.470
How's Panama?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.299
Hot, getting hotter.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.109
I'm hoping
to settle things quick.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.570
We should visit the kids
at Christmas.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.810
Yep, okay.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.579
Tom, things are good.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.579
Considering everything,
they're real good.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.119
Go have fun
with your old friends,

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.989
and I'll call you soon.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.250
I love you.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.720
Be safe.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.359
<i>Viva Tavo.</i>

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.820
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.159
Welcome to the helo bay.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.699
This is where
Dr. Scott set up her lab.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.569
It was in this small,
sealed space

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.840
that she developed the cure
and eventually tested it...

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.309
On some of our crew.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.040
Come, step through this door

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.579
and imagine yourself
in a bio-secure space,

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.649
one where you would have to
wear a suit like this

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.850
in order to protect yourself
from the virus.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.389
Excuse me, sir.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.320
So sorry to be a bother,
but would you mind?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.190
Not at all.
Oh, thanks much!

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.500
You just press that button
right there.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.580
Attention on deck!

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.719
There he is.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.719
Don't stop the reunion
on my account.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.259
Sir. Good to see you, Ray.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.459
Likewise, sir.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.989
Gator!

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.390
How's civilian life treating you?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.259
Well, can't say
it's less stressful

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.460
than being out at sea.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.729
My boy turned two yesterday.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.069
That's terrific.
Congrats.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.539
He's retired, but he's gonna
put on that uniform

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.739
and be Gator
one last time tomorrow, right?

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.070
Yeah, if I can find my sextant.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.539
They just can't leave.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.879
I keep promoting them, they
keep coming back.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.409
Captain.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.010
Nathan James has never looked better.
Thank you, sir.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.349
I'm just CO for the launch of the fleet.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.750
Then I'm on shore duty and mom duty.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.489
Sasha says Danny's doing all right.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.429
Well, you know more about him than I do.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.229
He's doing what makes him happy,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.660
or at least what keeps him sane.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.900
Hey, so how's school?

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.909
Got a fresh crop of sailors,
ready to serve.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.439
That's what I like to hear.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.639
You still teaching "Moby-Dick"?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.109
One day,
I'm gonna make you read it.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.640
I think I've been been through
enough torture.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.309
Ready for your big speech?

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.779
Mm.
We were one ship.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.649
Now we're a fleet. Life is good.
See?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.989
You don't need 800 pages.
Keep it simple.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.050
Captain Garnett, come in.
This is Captain Garnett.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.789
Your presence is requested on...

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.459
Besides, you don't have to
say a thing, admiral.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.190
Just being here with all of us,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.390
there are no words.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.020
<i>Gracias.</i>

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.029
Marco was right.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.559
This is the place to be.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.760
I'm offended we weren't invited.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.040
I could use a drink.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.939
Sleep tight, <i>amigo.</i>

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.539
It is a shame, I know.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.209
I have never been through
the Canal,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.410
but from what I hear,
it is beautiful.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.749
You must go!

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.149
I could take you on a drive.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.619
Through the rainforest
to a place,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.289
<i>a la cima de Volcan Baru.</i>

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.359
From there,
you can see both oceans at once.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.759
Both oceans at once?

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.700
To Volcan Baru.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.849
I'm afraid
you will have to wait your turn.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.589
The<i> Presidente</i> has many friends.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.989
Those are not friends,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.789
but as long as Fernando Asturius
controls the Panama Canal,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.659
he'll have many well-wishers.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.729
I'll take it as a good sign.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.069
The world is still
getting back on its feet,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.269
and global trade is a key factor
in promoting progress.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.539
You're American?

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.400
Sasha Cooper.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.809
Hector Martinez.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.139
<i>Republica de Gran Colombia.</i>

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.340
Gran Colombia?

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.879
Mm.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.279
So those are<i> your</i> protestors
out on the street.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.679
Not mine.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.949
Those are Panamanians
who seek to keep Panama free.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.750
While holding up photos
of your leader.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.759
Gustavo Barros has inspired
all of South America

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.359
to put aside centuries
of mistrust and come together.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.829
Tavo speaks for us all because
he puts the people first.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.369
He's a revolutionary.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.639
It's funny.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.909
When the US flexes its muscle,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.109
it is to protect world order.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:23.640
But when Latin Americans
stand up for their rights,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.310
they are revolutionaries.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:56.210
Well? Well?
We got work connections.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.749
We support
<i>El Presidente</i> Asturius.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.079
We only ask for the respect

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.880
from the north
that we well deserve.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.019
How long will you be
in Panama City?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.689
Not long, I'm afraid.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.959
Oh, but I see
<i>El Presidente</i> is free,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.829
so I'm going to wish him
a happy birthday.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.559
I hope to see you again.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.570
I look forward to it.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.139
It was easy, Mr. President.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.269
In fact, it was<i> too</i> easy.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.739
There's enough C4 explosives
to kill everyone in this room.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.110
Including you, sir.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.550
Ah, ah. Careful.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.550
That's the second breach
of your security.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.290
That's three ways...
Three ways to kill you, sir.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.499
It's not poison.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.770
But it could have been.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.169
Your military leadership...

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.240
They should not drink
with strangers.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.379
Your security

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.579
and the security of the
Panama Canal are at great risk.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.849
I'm asking that
you reconsider our offer.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.919
Let us help you identify
your vulnerabilities,

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.250
protect you while we train your
detail... And you think that this...

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.119
This trick of yours
will convince me?

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.329
To embarrass me
in front of my soldiers,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.060
my friends, at my own party?!

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.329
No, Miss Cooper.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.470
I told you,
I cannot accept your help.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.009
If I'm seen clutching at
the knees<i> de Los Estados Unidos,</i>

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.939
my own people will push me out!

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.809
It can be done in secret.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.409
There are no secrets in Panama.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:17.680
So unless you plan
to kill me on my birthday,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.420
I suggest you leave.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.510
Burk!

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.719
What the hell are you doing here?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.449
I thought you were X.O.
on the<i> James.</i> I am.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.850
My CO wanted me here
representing the ship

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.120
while she took some tourists
on a cruise around the harbor.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.989
Yeah, I managed
to get out of that one, too.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.529
Ah, it's good fun.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.929
People seem to like it,
so, I don't know...

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.999
Christ, Burk, when did I become
a museum exhibit?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.469
Oh, not an<i> exhibit.</i>

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.440
A<i> legend,</i> sir.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.279
Subsurface, you hear anything?

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.349
I'm picking up something.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.080
Could be biologics.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.619
Surface, what do you see?
No contacts on surface.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.559
Bridge, T.A.O.

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.629
I think we found them.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.959
Copy.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.429
You're all in for a treat.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.899
Seems our sonar operator
found a pod of dolphins

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.769
a thousand yards
off our port bow.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.169
We'll take you
for a closer look. Commander?

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.309
Ma'am,
recommend new course 0-3-0.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.709
Very well.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.109
That's Gator.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.910
I know, Grandpa.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.579
<i>We are here at fleet week,</i>

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.179
<i>and we are very excited.</i>

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.719
<i>As you can see, there is
a crowd building behind me,</i>

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.519
<i>and the Navy
is going to be showing off</i>

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.189
<i>the strength of its fleet.</i>

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.789
<i>And we are going to be talking
to Admiral Tom Chandler,</i>

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.000
<i>and we'll have that for you
coming up next.</i>

00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:01.419
<i>Well, this is a great day
for the Navy, for our country.</i>

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.680
<i>It's, uh,
proof of the resilience</i>

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.350
<i>of the American people.</i>

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.250
<i>That we could muster up
limited resou...</i>

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.730
What just happened?

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.399
I can't get fleet command
on the line.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.800
Something's wrong
with the satellite.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.270
No, we got bigger problems.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.610
What's going on?

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.089
My God.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:16.759
Looks like we've been followed

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.359
since we got in the country.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.090
And now we are
public enemy number one.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.439
Time to go.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.110
The<i> Federales</i>
are on their way here now!

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.449
Is the military smaller now?

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:44.849
Sure.
Um, so is the country.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.119
Look back throughout
our military history,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.450
you'll find plenty of examples

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.789
where we're at
a diminished capacity,

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.859
- we're unable...
- Sorry.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.329
We lost our satellite feed.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.329
I'm talking
to the guys in the van.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.799
Okay.
I'm so sorry.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.270
We're gonna get it fixed,
and we'll get right back to you.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.409
T.A.O., Aegis weapons,
fire control,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.940
and navigational radar
are failing.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.879
Something is frying
our 400-hertz switchboards.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.419
Emergency shut-down,
all systems.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.080
Shut everything down!

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.940
Those aren't ours.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.640
And their wings aren't clean.

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.310
Holy shit!
It's an attack.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.000
Take cover!

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.549
Clear the deck!
Move it, move it, move it!

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.320
Move, move, move!

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.610
God, no.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.309
Move, move, move!

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.780
Move!

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.680
Move, move!
Clear the deck!

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.470
Sir, sir!

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.139
DC reports massive fires
portside on decks two and three.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.949
The hull has been breached. How the
hell did we not see this coming?!

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.819
Early warning and radar systems
went dark across the base

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.419
right before the attack, and our
weapons systems are down.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.619
I think we were hacked.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.349
You have stingers in the armory?

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.819
Yes, sir!
Get the civilians off!

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.089
I want all gunners
and crew served weapons

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.489
manned by SCAT teams
up here now!

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:40.030
All gunners, to the rails!

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.229
No, no, we've lost contact,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.960
and reports are just coming in.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.630
This is the commander 2 MEF,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.899
I need a Marine on the ground
to tell me what's going on.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.569
Colonel, this is General Kinkaid.
I need all available assets

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.769
mobilized in
Naval Station Mayport.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.370
We believe we're under attack.

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.709
Let's get these systems
back online, team!

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.509
I want eyes on that battlefield!

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.579
Sir, DISN has been compromised.
Satellites are not responding,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.179
and our planes have been grounded.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.849
<i>Fleet command,
this is</i> Nathan James,<i> come in.</i>

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.319
<i>We are under attack.</i>

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.119
Hang tight,<i> Nathan James.</i>
We're doing what we can.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.529
Switch over to civilian band. We need our
comms. Admiral, we've got<i> Nathan James!</i>

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.929
<i>Weapons and ISR are down.
We cannot defend.</i>

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.269
Enemy aircraft appear to be
Pucara-class attack planes,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.599
but we have no radar.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.670
Get these people out of here!

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.359
Over there!

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.090
Gunners, cover the bow!

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.960
I have CIWS back up.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.229
And the five-inch?

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.769
Not yet.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:56.639
Bridge, T.A.O.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.239
We have CIWS, but we're at the
edge of maximum firing range.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.840
Recommend moving closer to base.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.310
Here comes another wave!

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.589
Hey!
Hey, come this way!

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.659
Come, come, quick! Keep your
head down! Head down, guys.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.130
To the bow!
Go, go, go!

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.270
Ammo!

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.290
No!

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.690
Ma'am, I'm here.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.299
You're going to be just fine.
You'll be just fine.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.540
Just stay calm. We can fix this
like we always do, right?

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.259
Ma'am, suggest
bearing 225 for 5 knots

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.860
to get inside
effective CIWS range.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:29.399
Ma'am?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.129
Negative.
CIWS won't be enough.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.069
If we get ourselves seen,
we get ourselves sunk.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.469
Keep us out of sight and out
of the line of fire. But...

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.670
I'm responsible
for every soul on this ship.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.409
And we're no good to the Navy
at the bottom of the bay.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.750
Our job is to be ready
to fight the battle to come.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.840
All right.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.179
<i>O'Connor</i> and<i> Cruz</i>
sank within an hour.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.719
God knows how many were trapped
on board when they went down.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.049
My God.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.389
Still can't get an accurate
report from the base.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.059
There were sailors and Marines
all over the place

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.389
for the event.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.590
So we're talking hundreds,
if not thousands, dead.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.129
And for all we know,
this was just the first wave.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.199
There may be more
going on as we speak.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.999
Are you saying this is a full-scale
invasion of the United States?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.669
I'm saying I can't get one
goddamn Army base to report in!

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.609
Our entire digital platform's
been wiped out,

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.409
and we have no idea
what's going on.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.749
Look...
we have landlines.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.549
We don't know if they're
still secure, but they work.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.289
We need to get every
single person in uniform online

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.090
and prepared
to defend this nation.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.829
Commander,
get to work on the computers.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.160
Find out who did this,
how they did it,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.029
and how to fix it.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.630
Aye, sir.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.210
Now somebody bring me
a goddamn map!

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.129
Airmen, can your birds fly?

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.529
No, sir.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.729
Anything with an on board
computer was hacked.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.799
They wiped us out on the ground.
I need a corpsman.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.470
My chief... he's hit bad.
Go, go.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.279
We'll get you all back to land
as soon as possible.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.680
But is it safe?

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.349
Sir, we'll make sure, but
everyone, just hang tight, okay?

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.689
We're all in this together.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.559
Gator?

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.690
You should go back
with the guests.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.629
Ma'am, I... You put on the
uniform for the cruise.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.960
But this isn't your fight.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.299
Your family needs you.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.499
My family knows we're all alive

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.969
because of<i> Nathan James.</i>

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:03.569
If it's all the same to you,
Captain,

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.039
I didn't fight by your side
just to give up now.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.109
I'd like to return
to active duty,

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.110
if you'll have me.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.250
Thank you.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.389
Command, come in.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.120
This is intercept team delta, over.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.990
I say again,
this is intercept team delta.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.529
Where have you been? The streets
are crawling with<i> Federales,</i> man!

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.599
We got to get out of here.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.599
Uh, I have some bad news.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.139
The US Navy fleet in Florida
was just attacked.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.209
All the ships were sunk,
and thousands are dead.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:41.409
What did you just say?

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.009
Tavo's taking credit for it

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.809
as revenge for the murder
of<i> El Presidente</i>

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.810
by<i> los Americanos!</i>
That's no coincidence.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.480
You don't overthrow Panama
while the US fleet is a threat.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.489
No, this was
a coordinated attack.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.159
Panama is now
under the protection

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.089
of Tavo and Gran Colombia.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:35:59.629
We have to get back
to the States.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.159
There's no point
in rushing home now.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.229
Danny, our fleet was hit.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.099
Our friends, our family...

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.169
They may be dead,

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.639
but for what comes next,
we're on the front line.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.909
We have no orders from home,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.639
but we know who the enemy is.

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.849
I say we go south,
toward Colombia.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:21.979
We gather intelligence,
allies, anything.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.049
We put ourselves in a position
to be the tip of the spear

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:27.450
until backup arrives.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.669
Can you get us to Colombia?

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:44.870
<i>Sí.</i>
I know some people.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.660
<i>Ya Basta.</i>

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.869
<i>Ya Basta.</i>

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.330
<i>Ya Basta!</i>

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.669
I will now speak
directly to our enemies

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.939
<i>in a language
they can understand.</i>

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.409
<i>Americans, you are on notice.</i>

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.679
<i>The people of Central
and South America are united!</i>

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.819
<i>We will no longer cower in fear
of your big stick.</i>

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.220
<i>For you do not offer us
protection, but enslavement.</i>

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.829
<i>Today marks the beginning
of a new equilibrium.</i>

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:20.169
<i>Gran Colombia will no longer
sit at the children's table</i>

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.699
<i>of international politics.</i>

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.100
<i>It is our turn!</i>

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.369
<i>Be warned.</i>

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:28.909
<i>If the United States
wants a fight,</i>

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.649
<i>you will lose.</i>

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.049
For in the words
of Simón Bolivar,

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:38.420
a people
who love their freedom...

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.320
will, in the end, be free.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.059
And we are united...

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.459
as a continent...

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.130
to fight for that freedom.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.400
<i>We are one nation under God!</i>

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.070
<i>La Gran Colombia!</i>

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.489
<i>Al Norte!</i>

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:15.220
<i>Al Norte! Al Norte!</i>

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.490
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.229
<i>IViva Tavo!
IViva Tavo! iViva Tavo!</i>

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.100
<i>IViva Gran Colombia!</i>

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.840
Turn it off.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.039
We must've been hacked.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.249
Comms, grounded air defenses,
even our weapons systems.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:39.449
We're at war.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.110
I have to get back
to fleet command,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.719
get eyes on the battlefield.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.920
Admiral Chandler.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.270
Diaz!
Is the<i> James</i> still afloat?!

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.539
Yes, sir!

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.740
Make a hole.
I'm going back with you.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.609
Yes, sir!
I'm going, too.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.010
Tell Meylan... Mike.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.419
I lost my fleet, Tom.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.749
It went down on my watch.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.289
If I'm gonna die,
I'm going down with the ship.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.819
You heard that speech,
you know where to start.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.159
We head south.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.359
Look for weapons and fuel.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.959
Stay off comms.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.359
I'll be in touch!

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.899
If I don't hear from you soon,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.969
I'm gonna come looking for you!
I don't doubt that.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.300
You stay safe!
