00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.608
<i>Previously on</i> "The Last Ship"...

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.053
You all have saved the world
three times now.

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.896
How on earth do you do it?

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:09.273
I can't promise
the fight won't be hard,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.243
But I can say we will prevail.

00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:14.889
- Gustavo's chief war strategist...
- Find out what he knows.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.857
You know his next moves.
Help me stop him.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.024
If I help you,
will that save my nation?

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.212
If you don't, will your nation
still be worth saving?

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.052
Dr. Montano just gave us the key.

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:27.088
We take Cuba...

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:29.282
We can win this war.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:41.515
Disparen!

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:47.315
Disparen!

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:52.125
Disparen!

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:05.335
Disparen!

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:12.805
Disparen!

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:20.545
Disparen!

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:37.165
Papá...

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:53.185
Simon.

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:14.535
Disparen!

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:24.885
Disparen!

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.514
The C-130 Liberty One

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:58.244
will depart Naval Air Station
Key West at 2200 hours.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.984
Lima team,
partnered Navy/Marine Corps,

00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.384
will air-drop 13 miles
off the Cuban coast,

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:06.454
landing at Guines, which...
According to intel

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.124
Admiral Chandler
obtained from Dr. Montano...

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.994
Is the home to
a hidden rebel stronghold.

00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:13.064
What kind of numbers
can we expect?

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:19.204
The rebel force is somewhere
between 500 and 5,000.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.404
Our team's
dropping in with a 2-ton gift

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:23.404
of small arms and light weapons.

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:25.074
Whatever their size,
I promise you,

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.405
that militia
will be well-outfitted.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.214
Now, once Lima team
makes contact

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:30.814
with El Gallo and his men...

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:32.414
I'm sorry, Admiral.

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:35.084
How confident are you
in this El Gallo?

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:38.954
This unknown leader of Free Cuba?

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:41.094
You think he's more inclined
to join our cause

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:45.164
than, say, the Chinese or the
Indians or the Brits right now?

00:03:45.165 --> 00:03:47.425
How confident are you
that when our team lands,

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:49.295
they find themselves met
by friendly interests

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:52.904
and not, say, indifference
or hostility... 1 to 10?

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:57.875
One being they slit our throats
soon as we hit the beach. Well...

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:09.915
Six, sir.

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:13.724
General, you signed off on this?

00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:15.124
I did, sir.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.655
Though, to be frank,
I have concerns.

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:20.594
General's worried the intel
I got from Dr. Montano

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:21.794
may not be trustworthy.

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:25.664
I've lost a lot of Marines
already, Mr. President.

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.204
Trust in anything
coming out of Gustavo's camp

00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:31.004
is in short supply.

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.874
But you trust it, Admiral.

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.544
I was with the man.

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.144
He lost faith in Gustavo

00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:38.145
and gave his life
to stop the bloodshed.

00:04:40.555 --> 00:04:42.954
I've had the country
running at full tilt

00:04:42.955 --> 00:04:44.284
for the last three months

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:46.554
to put us in a position
to take back Mexico,

00:04:46.555 --> 00:04:50.694
and now you wanna air-drop
a dozen of our finest

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:53.825
into the lion's den
before we can back 'em up?

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:55.234
Gustavo's preoccupied

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:57.364
with shoring up support
from his base.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:01.704
Now is the best time for us
to make our move on Cuba.

00:05:01.705 --> 00:05:03.174
And we need it, sir...

00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:05.304
Not just as a buffer
against another major attack,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.245
but as a staging area to launch
our own invasion south.

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.784
Please continue, Admiral.

00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:20.525
Thank you, sir.

00:05:52.425 --> 00:05:53.624
Señor Barros.

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.894
Gustavo.

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:59.164
Tell me, what's a win?

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:01.434
Jumping to the end already?

00:06:01.435 --> 00:06:03.634
Doesn't feel like a jump to me.

00:06:03.635 --> 00:06:06.365
In your speeches, you promised
your people a quick victory.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:07.634
But, from what I've seen,

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.104
you've been stuck in place
for some time now.

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:12.374
I'm curious
if your thinking has changed

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.114
or if you regret starting
a war with the United States.

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:16.975
We didn't start this war.

00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.514
You sank a U.S. fleet
in Mayport

00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:20.184
on the very day
that your loyalists

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:22.314
murdered the duly-elected
leader of Panama.

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.784
That sounds textbook.

00:06:23.785 --> 00:06:26.924
Mayport wasn't an attack,
nor was it the beginning.

00:06:26.925 --> 00:06:31.594
You're young, but smart enough
to know the U.S.'s history

00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:34.934
of murder and political
insurrection in Latin America.

00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:37.795
Guatemala '54, Cuba '61,

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:40.465
D.R. '65, Chile '73,

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:43.004
Nicaragua '82, Grenada '83.

00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.474
This war
is a battle for the survival

00:06:45.475 --> 00:06:48.344
of the people of Gran Colombia.

00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.484
So, is this your justification
for the forced conscription,

00:06:51.485 --> 00:06:53.945
the purges, the death squads?

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:56.415
Where do you get this information from?

00:06:56.425 --> 00:06:58.015
Several accounts
from defectors...

00:06:58.025 --> 00:06:59.485
Defectors from what?

00:06:59.495 --> 00:07:01.694
Our borders are not closed.

00:07:01.695 --> 00:07:04.155
People are free
to come and go as they wish.

00:07:04.165 --> 00:07:06.164
Their accounts
are remarkably consistent.

00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:09.295
This isn't a war
of public opinion.

00:07:09.305 --> 00:07:13.704
This is about taking
a fresh look at the world...

00:07:13.705 --> 00:07:16.635
Post-virus, post-famine.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:20.644
It's about adjusting
the balance.

00:07:20.645 --> 00:07:24.385
United States have been
bullies for too long.

00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:29.315
This movement is a rebirth.

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:31.454
Take your camera
and your notepad

00:07:31.455 --> 00:07:32.724
and go to the countryside.

00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:36.594
Go to the cities
of Central and South America

00:07:36.595 --> 00:07:39.194
and see the pride
in people's faces.

00:07:39.195 --> 00:07:42.334
Freedom from tyranny
is what they demanded.

00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:44.604
And it's what I'm giving them.

00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:48.405
And I'm inviting the people
of all of the Americas to join.

00:08:04.355 --> 00:08:07.424
Ensign Swain.
Any news?

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:09.694
No, sir.
No surprise there.

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:11.294
She's probably hiding
in a hole somewhere,

00:08:11.295 --> 00:08:12.424
hoping we give up looking.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.625
No chance of that, sir.

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:15.764
I've been monitoring
cell activity for Colombia

00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:17.695
and the United States
for months.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:20.304
If Kelsi's still in contact
with anyone down south,

00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:22.234
we'll know it.
Well, good.

00:08:22.235 --> 00:08:23.774
Till then, I have
another job for you.

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:26.305
Sir, I... Radio jammers
aboard the<i> James</i>

00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:27.644
were fried in the attack.

00:08:27.645 --> 00:08:29.644
I need you to reprogram
her electric grid.

00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:31.644
I want to make sure those
Cuban artillery batteries

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:35.054
don't use our Herc
as target practice.

00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:36.585
Where do you need me?

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:42.695
$1.25.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.125
Um...

00:08:49.005 --> 00:08:51.265
I only got $1.15.

00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:54.204
Are you kidding?

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:55.375
No. Beat it.

00:08:57.205 --> 00:08:59.944
Hey! Stop!

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.445
Get back here!

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.709
Zoey?
It's getting late, sweetie.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.680
Time to come in.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.849
But, Mom!
Aunt Kelsi's here.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.049
Just a few more pushes?

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.589
Yeah, Mom.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.790
Just a few more?

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.529
Yeah, I heard rumors
that you were in Carta-geena?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.799
Mm, Cartagena.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.930
Yeah, right.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.269
You didn't leave the country?

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.670
You just disappeared.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.609
If you wanna ask, ask.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.879
Just stop, please.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.479
Oh, go ahead.
Ask me.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.019
I don't need to ask.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.349
'Cause you know
everything about me, right?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.219
I know what kind of person
you are.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.219
Oh, what kind of a pers...
The kind who runs off

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.559
with any loser
promising adventure.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.889
The kind who makes a mess

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:58.689
and leaves the rest of us
to clean it up.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.290
The kind
who hasn't even bothered

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.899
to come see her own daughter.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:04.299
Mom?

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.769
Can you read me
"The Paper Bag Princess"?

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.769
Uh...
did you brush your teeth?

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.110
Okay, I'll be in in a sec.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.640
Night, Aunt Kelsi.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.309
Night.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.649
Sleep tight.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.050
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.659
Remember when you used to
read that to me?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.329
You need to turn yourself in.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.859
I know.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.129
No, you don't know.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.399
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.799
Putting me in danger.
Putting Zoey in danger.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.599
No one's in danger.
It's not like I'm...

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.540
A what?

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.339
A murderer?

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.139
A terrorist?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.540
Go ahead.
Tell me you're not.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.279
Look me in the eye
and tell me the cops,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.410
the Navy, and the goddamn FBI

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.149
tore my house apart
for three weeks

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.350
because you didn't kill
that woman.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.960
I don't know where else to go.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.429
Police station would be a start.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.769
And say what?

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.969
The truth.
The truth?

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.569
What's the truth, Elli?

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.309
That I'm an idiot?

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.579
That I thought I was helping?

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.119
That it turns out I am just
a piece of Florida white trash

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.389
thinking I could solve
the world's problems?

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.789
I know what I did.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.659
And I know what's coming for me.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.460
God knows I deserve it.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.600
You're not trash,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.139
and you're not a monster.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.670
And, I mean, at this point,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.009
according to
the U.S. government,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:57.749
you're basically the most
important human being

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.810
on the planet, right?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.819
Just tell them something.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.349
Cut a deal.
It won't be so bad.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.560
Yeah.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.090
We're gonna get you a good deal.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.099
And we're gonna make it
through this.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.300
You, me, and Zoey.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.179
On course, 2-1-0,
making 16 knots.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.119
Estimated time of arrival
based on current speed...

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.850
3 hours and 45 minutes.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.189
Anything pop up
in the shakedown?

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.719
Well, some trouble out
of two gen,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.189
but we'll have it online
in the hour.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.329
And we haven't sprung any leaks,
so that's a good thing.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.799
Roger that.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.929
CIC, Bridge.
Report your status.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.799
Sub-surface clear.
All systems go.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.339
Surface clear.
All systems go.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.539
Bridge, T.A.O.
Testing is complete.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.809
All combat systems
are up and ready to go.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.140
It's good to be back, ma'am.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:04.479
Glad to hear it.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.479
After three months of dry dock,
I think we set a record.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.349
Captain, Radio.
All circuits up.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.280
HF Channel
is encrypted and secure.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.889
Who else do we have on the line?

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.889
Patching through Command now.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.889
<i>Nathan James,</i>
we hear you loud and clear.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.359
Much as I enjoyed Moby Dick,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.029
it's a pleasure
to hear your voice.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.899
Admiral Chandler,
how's the Herc?

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.169
Weapons supply is currently
being loaded and on schedule.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.099
Hitting Cuban airspace
in 3 hours.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.769
Sound about right,
Captain Green?

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.770
We'll be waiting.
Have a safe flight, Admiral.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.580
Go ahead.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.919
Watch it, Marine.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.919
Sorry, Chief.
My bad.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.259
Excuse the fellas, Admiral.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.659
The Marines have been grounded
since the Mayport attack.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.990
They're angry
and ready to hook and jab.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.459
They'll get their chance.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.800
Thank you, sir,
for everything you've done.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.330
All loaded up.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.669
When's the last time you jumped?

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.269
On purpose?
I don't know.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.539
Six or seven years.
Like falling off a bike.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.279
Sure you don't want
to join in the fun, Professor?

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.679
Someone's gotta stay on
the plane and do the hard work.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.219
Gunny, check the palletized
gear and equipment.

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.349
Lima team, load up.
Let's go get some.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.489
Oo-rah.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.020
Boo-yah!
Boo-yah.

00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:24.745
Hector.

00:15:28.445 --> 00:15:29.985
Okay.

00:15:31.915 --> 00:15:33.385
Octavio.

00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:47.765
Hector...

00:17:58.735 --> 00:18:01.064
You know, I always wondered
why Navy corpsman

00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:02.604
deploy with the Marines.

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:05.475
'Cause the Marines like to fight, sir.

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:09.744
I-I mean, I...

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:12.014
I'm... I'm not saying
that y'all don't, sir.

00:18:12.015 --> 00:18:13.614
I was just, um...

00:18:13.615 --> 00:18:15.284
You know, I meant that, um...

00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:18.014
I was saying that we...

00:18:18.015 --> 00:18:19.954
Take it easy, corpsman.

00:18:19.955 --> 00:18:21.415
Save your energy.

00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.425
Yes, sir.

00:18:24.425 --> 00:18:27.155
So, you guys work out?

00:18:27.165 --> 00:18:31.225
C'mon. Thought you bastards
were supposed to be fun.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:33.564
We've been waiting like 50 years

00:18:33.565 --> 00:18:37.034
to invade this shit-box
island, am I right?

00:18:37.035 --> 00:18:39.535
My mother's Cuban.

00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.714
Command, this is Liberty One.

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:47.975
We're leaving American airspace

00:18:47.985 --> 00:18:50.045
and proceeding on schedule.
Over.

00:18:50.055 --> 00:18:51.445
Copy that, Liberty One.

00:18:51.455 --> 00:18:53.384
<i>Nathan James</i>
is in range to jam the radar

00:18:53.385 --> 00:18:54.784
in the Cuban
artillery batteries.

00:18:54.785 --> 00:18:56.654
Stand by.

00:18:56.655 --> 00:18:59.194
HF feed is holding up.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:01.524
Wish we had better eyes
on the battlefield.

00:19:01.525 --> 00:19:02.525
Yes, sir.

00:19:02.535 --> 00:19:05.594
Without satellites,
this will have to do.

00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:06.734
Ensign, we ready?

00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:08.264
All set, Admiral.

00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:11.134
Okay.

00:19:11.135 --> 00:19:12.735
Liberty One, Command.

00:19:12.745 --> 00:19:16.004
You are clear to proceed.

00:19:16.005 --> 00:19:20.214
Navy Spear,
sending jam package now.

00:19:20.215 --> 00:19:22.615
Commence jamming sequence
on your end.

00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:26.355
Aye.

00:19:28.355 --> 00:19:30.224
Jamming sequence initiated.

00:19:30.225 --> 00:19:32.624
Liberty One, Navy Spear.

00:19:32.625 --> 00:19:34.564
Cuba's blind,
and they don't know it.

00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:36.425
Copy that, Navy Spear.

00:19:36.435 --> 00:19:38.634
Ground winds
out of the northwest...

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:40.295
1-5 knots.

00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:42.834
Deploy chutes 9,000.

00:19:42.835 --> 00:19:45.574
Jump Team, Flight Lead.
2-minute warning.

00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:49.044
Lima team, stand by.
2 minutes, 2 minutes.

00:19:49.045 --> 00:19:51.505
2 minutes.

00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:53.045
2 minutes.

00:19:59.115 --> 00:20:00.315
Good luck.

00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:03.655
Oo-rah.

00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:08.195
All right, go!

00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:16.535
Go!

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:23.075
Go!

00:20:25.475 --> 00:20:27.075
Go!

00:20:32.485 --> 00:20:34.754
All teams, Command.
Jamming's holding.

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:36.154
You have another 40 seconds.

00:20:36.155 --> 00:20:37.685
Navy Spear, roger that.

00:20:44.765 --> 00:20:46.434
We're good. Let's go.
Weapons supply away.

00:20:46.435 --> 00:20:49.435
Uplink confirmed.
Nav system engaged.

00:20:51.235 --> 00:20:53.504
Aye, sir.
I have control of the cache.

00:20:53.505 --> 00:20:54.975
Deploying the chute now.

00:21:03.655 --> 00:21:06.055
Unknown air track.
Inbound, Liberty One.

00:21:25.275 --> 00:21:27.074
What the hell
is going on over there?

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:28.544
Flight Lead, come in.
Come in.

00:21:28.545 --> 00:21:30.875
Liberty One, Liberty One,
this is Command.

00:21:37.815 --> 00:21:39.554
We have a missile detonation.

00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:42.485
Target's trajectory leading
back to the north side of Cuba.

00:21:42.495 --> 00:21:45.695
Liberty One is hit
and going down.

00:21:59.575 --> 00:22:01.575
Flight Lead, what's your status?

00:22:03.975 --> 00:22:06.175
Flight Lead, do you copy?!

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.610
What the hell?!

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.150
Did everyone egress?

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.219
No.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:43.159
No.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.420
No.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.690
No, no.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.759
Lima, Command.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.959
What is your status?

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.029
Our status is goddamn livid, Admiral.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.240
Why weren't we jamming
those artillery batteries?

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.509
We're gonna get you
some answers.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.740
This is Dufine.
I wanna speak to Captain Utt.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.449
Command, Utt.
Lima team has landed.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:12.090
No sign of Bowen, Lin, Murphy,
Weeks, Santora, or Hird.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.859
Mostly likely
they were K.I.A.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:18.989
Looks like Liberty One
was shot out of the sky.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.590
Pilots were on course.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.999
Jamming was set.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.199
We had no early warning.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.270
Admiral Chandler
was also on board, ma'am.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.339
Command, Navy Spear.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.949
Commencing
search and rescue now.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.750
Helm, all ahead, 2/3.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.419
Gear is off target.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.750
No confirm on beacon.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.490
It must be out of range.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.430
Mother, can we get a fix
on that weapons supply?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.969
We were tracking it using
a radar relay from the plane.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.570
Last position,
supply was off-course,

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.640
headed west on a path toward
the north shore of Havana.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.310
That's Gustavo country.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.849
The rebel camp is 3 miles
in the other direction.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:18.519
Why don't we go there first?

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.119
No. We secure the gear.
Then we find the rebels.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.459
You wanna walk into Havana

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.190
with half our team
and no firepower?

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.599
We can't risk letting
those weapons

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.199
fall into the wrong hands.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.060
I agree.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.729
We don't have a choice.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.999
They know we're here,
so we have to move fast.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.399
That beacon has a 2-mile range.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.870
If we can get in the area,
I know we can find it.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.110
Mission hasn't changed.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.219
Roger that.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.619
Command, Utt.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.950
We are proceeding feet dry
in search of weapons supply.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.890
Update when we arrive.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.230
Copy all.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.169
Ma'am, based on its speed
and trajectory,

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.639
the plane could have
gone down anywhere here.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.810
If we're looking for a debris
field, it could be miles long.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.779
Let's get that bird in the air.

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.779
Aye, ma'am.
I'm going to CIC.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.980
The bridge is yours.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:26.450
Roger.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.810
Aah!

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.629
This entire borough's
a hotbed for Cuban military.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:13.369
Just that kinda day.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.169
Gear's close.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.100
Whole thing could've
been picked over by now.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.770
Barco, take Green and see
if you can get eyes on.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.909
Aye, sir.
Let's go.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.710
Let's do it.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.849
Hey, ma'am.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.280
Ma'am, your neck is bleeding.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.319
It's... It's nothing.
I didn't even feel it. No.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.259
You probably just got nicked
by the shrapnel from the blast.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.790
Here, just apply pressure.
Okay?

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.480
Aah!

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.820
Aaaahhh!

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.289
Package is across
the street behind the bar.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.419
Can't get eyes on it yet,
but it's there.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.489
Could be on the rooftop.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.689
Half the city's awake,

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.959
and the other half
will be up soon.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.230
Let's move.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.649
Debris field scattered.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.580
No sign of life.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.620
Hell.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.870
Anyone else hearing that?

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.599
Mother, I'm picking up
something strong here.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.209
Copy that, Brawler.
We see it.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.539
Looks like it's headed
to the port at Matanzas.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:10.279
Navy Spear, what do you see?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.279
We don't have an I.D. yet, sir,
but it's huge.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.410
It's got the same signature

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.949
as the ship we fought
at the Yucatán Strait.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.889
You said you hit
that battleship pretty hard.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.019
Yeah.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.889
No worse than
she hit <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.489
She's a monster.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:30.160
The radar jamming was focused
on the artillery batteries.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.829
If that ship
was patrolling the waters

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.039
over the horizon
from the<i> Nathan James,</i>

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.910
it would have had
a clear look at Liberty One.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.050
This wasn't on you, Ensign.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.449
Bridge, Captain.
Set course to 2-4-5.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.620
Course 2-4-5, aye.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.189
This time, we sink her.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.859
Ready all VLS.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.860
Aye, ma'am.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.420
Vamos.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.180
Hector...

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.700
Hmm?

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.130
Looks like we're in
over our heads.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.599
Have to take it piece by piece.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.669
Toone, cut her down.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.069
Yes, sir.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.870
The rest of us, underneath.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.690
El Gallo.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:57.969
Fuentes.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.639
Admiral.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:03.709
Leader of the Cuban rebels.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.380
We have a lot to discuss.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.719
Closing in on the target, ma'am.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.259
1,500 yards.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:17.760
We should see them
when we get around the bend.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.599
We lost the signature.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.130
It's okay.
She's trapped in the bay now.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.200
OOD, slow to 3 knots.
Stand by to maneuver.

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:33.470
Aye, ma'am.
Helm, all ahead 1/3 for 3 knots.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.670
Helm, aye.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.369
Prepare to fire

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.439
as soon as we get eyes
on that ship.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.170
Aye.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.989
Where the hell'd it go?

00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.990
There's no other way
out of this harbor.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:41.114
We got the weight, Toone.
Cut it.

00:34:41.115 --> 00:34:42.585
Yep.

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.649
Bring it up.
Careful.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.150
Set it down.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:15.540
Hey!

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.550
Oh!

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.780
Aye.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.920
Americanos! Americanos!

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.230
Holy shit!

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.770
I need some help here!

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.579
Mother, Lima.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.849
We're trapped in the courtyard,
and contact is imminent.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.249
Request emergency evac
at my location. Over.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.119
Lima, Navy Spear.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.920
Helo is 20 mikes
from your posit. Over.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.389
Push!

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.460
Push!

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.460
They're gonna ram it!

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.800
Kandie, set a claymore
on that door.

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.539
Hold it. Push.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.210
Push!

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.349
We're set.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.279
Lima team, on my command,
drop back.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.349
All guns on the door.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.150
When they breach, give 'em hell.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.830
Drop back, drop back!

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.169
I didn't jump out of a plane

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.299
to get killed by friendly fire.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.970
You guys
wanna lower your weapons?

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.310
You're clear.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.850
Package secure?

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.729
The street's contained,
but we need to leave... now.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:27.269
Welcome to Cuba.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.800
Vámonos.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.229
Smokes, thermites, and frags.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.830
You got it all.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.169
Systems check.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.639
Got that?

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.550
You know, for a Navy man,
you're not bad with a rifle.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.720
Yeah, well, for a Marine,
you're not bad as a doorstop.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.390
Get a room.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.729
Then we'll have to take the
airfield, the capital building,

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.990
the presidential palace,
and then the radio station.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.460
Sounds like you got
everything under control.

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.669
It's been
a difficult few months,

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:36.069
but the worst is still ahead.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.609
Thank you
for living up to your end,

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.210
even though you had
no reason to trust me.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.820
Disparen.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:53.750
Disparen.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.049
Disparen!

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.120
Viva Tavo!

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.909
Coming in from the west side,

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.840
as well as from the center.
That's great.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.940
Hey, Kelsi?
