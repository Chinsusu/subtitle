00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:01.384
<i>Previously on The Last Ship</i>

00:00:01.581 --> 00:00:03.070
- Do you miss it, sir?
- Miss what?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.067
War.

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:07.295
Gustavo Barros has inspired
all of South America

00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:08.301
He's a revolutionary.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:11.864
<i>Americans, We will no longer
cower in fear of your big stick.</i>

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:13.927
This is a full-scale invasion.

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:16.287
Emergency shut-down.
Shut everything down!

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:17.801
Take cover!

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.395
<i>If the United States wants a fight,
you will lose.</i>

00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:22.299
The US Navy fleet in Florida
was just attacked.

00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:23.437
All the ships were sunk,

00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.560
but for what comes next,
we're on the front line.

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:27.226
If I'm gonna die,
I'm going down with the ship.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.444
We're at war.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.945
<i>Earlier today,
the United States of America</i>

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:33.475
<i>was suddenly
and without provocation...</i>

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.879
Alisha, are you there?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880
Yeah, honey, I'm here.

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:37.100
I was so worried.

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.029
You know, the...
The... the attack.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.370
Y-You didn't say
you were going to Mayport,

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:42.719
and your friends were there.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.190
So I thought maybe you went, and...

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.789
Baby, I'm just so happy
to hear your voice.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.589
I'm okay.
Are you all right?

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.859
No.
I mean... yeah, yeah.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.060
I-I'm fine.
I'm just freaking out a little.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.869
Those ships...
Are they all gone?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.730
Is there gonna be another attack?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.539
They're not saying
anything new on TV.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.400
Honey, don't watch the TV.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.939
Everything's going to be okay.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.070
I promise.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.139
Look, I... I got to be here
a little while longer,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.879
but I'll call you
as soon as I can, okay?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.279
We got a lot of good people
working hard to keep us safe.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.619
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.080
Y-You need to call me soon.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.089
Let me know what's going on. Let
me know you're okay. Promise?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.089
<i>I have therefore
asked the Congress</i>

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.029
<i>to declare a State of War</i>

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.159
<i>between the United States
and the Gran Colombian Empire.</i>

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.229
I promise.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.499
I love you.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.299
Yeah, I love you, too.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.569
<i>Absolute victory.</i>

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.700
<i>May God bless
the United States of America.</i>

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.109
<i>The President has declared war</i>

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.509
<i>against
the Gran Colombian Empire.</i>

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.249
Tom.
It's good to see you.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.919
You, too, Joe. No
word from the <i>James.</i>

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.580
They won't call until it's safe.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.119
Anything from our team in Panama?

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.459
Nothing yet.
But no news is good news.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.059
General. Russ.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.260
- Admiral.
- My Marines?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.730
They're starting a body count.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.739
Doesn't do it justice.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.139
They hit us hard.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.209
Admiral, the reports
are still dribbling in,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.279
but Panama has definitely
thrown in with Gustavo.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.149
Costa Rica and Ecuador
are on the brink.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.079
If a domino effect
starts in the region,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.619
we could be in real trouble.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.889
Gustavo won't stop
south of our border.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.950
How are we supposed to defend
against a second attack

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.959
if we don't even know
how the first one happened

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.820
or if we can even
recover from it?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.930
I know someone
who can help with that.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.629
A student of mine
at the Academy.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.899
A midshipman?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.499
Clayton Swain.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.969
He saw this attack coming.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.369
Master Chief, we need to find him
and bring him here.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.839
Yes, sir.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.709
We need to deploy
all our available assets.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.709
If it floats, flies,
or rolls, it fights.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.579
Agreed.
We need every piece of intel

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.110
we have on Central
and South America...

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.579
Air and Naval assets,
troop levels,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.980
- centers of gravity... everything.
- Wait.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.650
Are you talking about
sending our assets south?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.859
We have no command and control.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.059
I can't get a single
field commander on the phone.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.659
How are we supposed to come up

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.129
with a global strategic plan?

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.329
He's right.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.999
The President may have declared war,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.599
but right now we don't have
a military to fight it.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.869
We've got nothing.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.600
Not true.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.740
We have <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.879
Many of you here
are new to the Navy...

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880
new to this ship.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.019
Some of you,
we've been here before.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.220
Either way,
what happened in Mayport

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.829
is not something
you ever get used to.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.499
It hurts.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.429
And it was meant to hurt.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.899
That's what our enemy wanted to do.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.570
And today, he succeeded.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.239
It caught us off guard,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.310
sent a powerful message,
trying to shake our resolve.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.720
But a war isn't lost
because we're hurt.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.120
For over 200 years,
the United States Navy has

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.729
built, sustained, and protected
its war-fighting culture.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.529
This attack doesn't change that.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.869
In fact, it will once again
bring out the best in us.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.139
Our enemies
have underestimated us.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.139
And if you doubt that,
look back at the past few years.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.480
Look at the people
who've been on this ship.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.149
When trouble arises,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.019
we have proven
time and time again,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.749
no matter the enemy,
no matter the odds,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.959
one ship can do it.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.690
<i>This</i> ship can do it.

00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:06.355

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.889
Gustavo has put a bounty
on your heads.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.489
100,000 pesos each.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.230
Any news on the American fleet?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.500
They're saying it's destroyed.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.039
You know, in Kenya,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.310
we had a nickname
for <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.910
It means "invincible."

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.849
These rebels...

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.849
You think
they have intel we can use?

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.519
They haven't been successful
against Gustavo so far.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.059
<i>Sí.</i>

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.259
It's very hard to beat Gustavo's
army and his microphone.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.790
But the rebels are organizing.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.459
They have a new leader...
Armando Maza.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.799
Oh, the Venezuelan guerilla...

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.860
The man who burns people alive.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.530
Don't worry. Armando doesn't
do that to his friends.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.030
Sir, what is that?

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.169
Those are our satellites
crashing to the Earth.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.370
Last we heard, the MSC
supply ship was right here,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.579
just 90 miles from us.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.840
We can get there in three hours

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.109
to restock our fuel and weapons.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.849
Right now, we are low on both.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.649
Got to figure we could run into
trouble on our way there.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.980
Those Pucaras that hit Mayport

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.649
have a max range of 217 miles.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.119
They either came from land
or they got a ride.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.789
Brazil had a carrier,
but even before the plague,

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.529
it was never able to run
for more than a few months.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.129
Well, they could have got it running
long enough to launch the attack.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.660
And we can't rule out that
Gustavo could have put together

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.469
a fleet of warships
from across South America.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.539
So we're just gonna have to rely
on our single-ship skills.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.869
Yes, sir.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.009
On that, Captain,
what's our sitrep?

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.679
Sir, the computer virus
knocked out satellites offline,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.609
leaving us with
no GPS capabilities.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.079
Some E-Loran beacons are still up,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.149
but once we get 30 miles
off the coast, they're useless.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.089
CIC reports radar, targeting,
and weapon systems

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.959
were all shut down once
the 400-hertz power grid fried.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.889
So we can't see or shoot?

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.429
- Correct.
- We were able to hot-wire passive sonar,

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.029
so at least we can hear.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.800
And the five-inch can shoot,
it just can't move.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.239
We also have CIWS
and crew-served weapons.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.969
- What about comms?
- We had to zero out our crypto,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.439
so we can't call fleet command

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.909
without giving away our location
or plan of action.

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.640
We're really all alone.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.319
Well, my old SWO Commander
used to tell me,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.849
"Looking for sympathy?

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.919
Look in the dictionary
between 'syphilis' and 'shit.'"

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.389
Gustavo doesn't know
we're alive.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.859
That's to our advantage.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.990
We get to the MSC ship,
we resupply,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.930
and we take the fight to him.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.964
What's this?

00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:27.764
All the color-coded plans
and war contingencies

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:30.104
the U.S. Military
and Intelligence communities

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:32.635
have dreamt up
in the past 50 years.

00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:34.244
Oh, good.

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:36.105
We have a plan to invade Iceland.

00:09:36.115 --> 00:09:37.974
It's better to have a plan
and not need it

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:39.775
than the opposite, I suppose.

00:09:39.785 --> 00:09:42.384
Not so long ago,
I remember looking at

00:09:42.385 --> 00:09:44.515
a similar plan
for a viral outbreak.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:47.254
That's before we even knew
what the red flu was.

00:09:47.255 --> 00:09:49.185
How'd that work out for you?

00:09:51.195 --> 00:09:52.924
Fortunately,
we were able to improvise.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.464
There has to be
some useful intel in here.

00:09:55.465 --> 00:09:58.395
<i>This was an attack
not just on the United States,</i>

00:09:58.405 --> 00:09:59.864
<i>but on the world.</i>

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.934
<i>And as always,
we will rise to the occasion.</i>

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.274
<i>I have, therefore...</i>

00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:05.604
Admiral Chandler?

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:07.204
Mr. Swain,
before the planes came,

00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:10.075
the U.S. was the victim
of a cyberattack.

00:10:11.745 --> 00:10:14.684
It killed our satellites,
shut down our anti-access

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:16.345
and area denial systems,

00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:19.284
and destroyed weapons control
on all our networked assets...

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:23.624
Ships, tanks, planes,
helos, Aegis, and missile silos.

00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:25.024
Whoa.

00:10:25.025 --> 00:10:26.895
Your theory was correct.

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:31.095
Grab your things and come with
me. You're gonna be here awhile.

00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:34.304
Do you need to call anyone?

00:10:34.305 --> 00:10:35.765
I forgot to ask.

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:38.034
Are you married?
Do you live with your folks?

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:39.304
No, sir.
I'm not married,

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:42.244
and, uh, my parents
died in the plague.

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:44.975
Right.

00:10:46.315 --> 00:10:48.445
Oh, my God.

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:50.584
You wrote that
U.S. military installations

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.984
were extremely vulnerable
to cyberattacks.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:54.454
That was my conclusion, sir.

00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:56.324
It had to do with the number
of nodes and the redundancies...

00:10:56.325 --> 00:10:58.194
I need you to find the virus,
where it came from,

00:10:58.195 --> 00:10:59.524
and how to get rid of it.

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:02.064
You'll be working
with Commander Granderson.

00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:04.064
Good luck, Mr. Swain.

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:06.334
Oh.
Raise your right hand.

00:11:06.335 --> 00:11:08.204
POTUS usually does this,
but he's not here, so...

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:11.075
Do you solemnly swear to support
and defend the Constitution...

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.074
So help you God?

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:20.275
I do.

00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:22.014
Congratulations, Ensign Swain.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.684
You are now a member
of the United States Navy.

00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:26.085
Get to work.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:34.695
You can put your arm down,
Ensign.

00:11:46.305 --> 00:11:48.575
We're close.

00:11:49.645 --> 00:11:51.575
It's only a few more kilometers.

00:11:58.055 --> 00:11:59.784
Easy, easy.

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:02.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:15.275 --> 00:12:17.405
They look like gringos.

00:12:28.615 --> 00:12:29.814
He knows who we are.

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:32.824
And I don't think
he wants to be our friend.

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:34.284
Hey, hey!
Hey!

00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:37.094
Drop...
your weapons.

00:12:37.095 --> 00:12:38.555
I don't think so, <i>amigo.</i>

00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:44.364
Oh, crap.

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:46.964
Danny Green.

00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:49.104
Is that you?

00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:50.374
Pablo?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.305
Can't believe it.
Get over here.

00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:57.645
No freakin' way!

00:12:58.915 --> 00:13:00.885
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:06.654
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:07.885
<i>Sí.</i>

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:14.864
Pablo, this is Wolf.

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:16.325
Hey.
Hey.

00:13:16.335 --> 00:13:18.864
This is Marco, Sasha, Kandie.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:20.464
"Pablo"?

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:23.604
Yeah, well, "Paul Shemanski" doesn't quite
have the same street cred down here.

00:13:23.605 --> 00:13:24.935
Pablo's D.I.A.

00:13:24.945 --> 00:13:26.335
He's been in the jungle so long,

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:27.874
he's practically gone native.

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:30.544
We worked joint ops
in Brazil and Colombia

00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:32.144
back in the day.
Yeah.

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.745
Well, thank God for D.I.A.
Thank God.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.485
Man, I heard about Mayport.

00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:43.624
Your buddies on <i>Nathan James?</i>

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.355
No news yet.

00:13:45.365 --> 00:13:47.364
My wife's the CO.

00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:49.825
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.

00:13:50.495 --> 00:13:53.834
Now I'm seeing your ugly-ass mug
all over the local news.

00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:55.165
Not a coincidence.

00:13:55.175 --> 00:13:56.434
I figured.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.034
Things are definitely heating up.

00:13:58.035 --> 00:13:59.635
All right, come on.

00:13:59.645 --> 00:14:01.505
I'll catch you up on the way.

00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:04.175
Danny frickin' Green.

00:14:07.445 --> 00:14:08.714
Ma'am,
according to our last sight,

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:10.654
we're here on our L.O.P.

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.184
That's approximately 10 miles
southeast of the supply ship.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.924
Very well.

00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:17.794
O.O.D., continue along charted course.
Aye, ma'am.

00:14:17.795 --> 00:14:19.994
O.O.D., I've got
multiple objects in the water,

00:14:19.995 --> 00:14:22.125
starboard side,
bearing 0-1-2 relative,

00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:23.935
approximately 3,000 yards.

00:14:39.485 --> 00:14:41.214
Someone hit a container ship

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:42.745
with a large-caliber weapon.

00:14:42.755 --> 00:14:44.484
Jesus.

00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:46.824
It looks like the goods
were bound for Mexico.

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.224
Incoming!

00:14:49.225 --> 00:14:51.695
General quarters.
Start evasive maneuvers!

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.764
Bridge reports bulldog inbound,
bearing 1-4-1.

00:14:55.765 --> 00:14:57.034
I have it.

00:14:57.035 --> 00:14:59.164
Impact estimated in 30 seconds.

00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.764
Missile's almost in range.

00:15:00.765 --> 00:15:03.435
Deploy countermeasures!

00:15:07.505 --> 00:15:09.774
Missile's path unchanged.

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:12.984
Engaging in 3, 2, 1.

00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:14.245
Fire CIWS.

00:15:18.055 --> 00:15:20.454
Target splashed.

00:15:20.455 --> 00:15:21.925
Nice shot, Valdez.

00:15:23.525 --> 00:15:25.455
Where the hell
did that come from?

00:15:25.465 --> 00:15:27.264
Wherever it was,
we're outgunned...

00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:29.725
Too blind to find, fix, or kill.

00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:31.195
Then we have to outrun it.

00:15:31.205 --> 00:15:33.004
Helmsman, all ahead,
flank three!

00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:35.135
Aye, ma'am.
All ahead, flank three.

00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:41.005
Masthead lookout reports
a corvette class warship hull

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:42.205
down on the horizon.

00:15:42.215 --> 00:15:44.944
They can see us,
but we can't see them.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.214
All right.

00:15:46.215 --> 00:15:48.685
The fight starts here.

00:15:58.305 --> 00:16:01.514
Gustavo's taking out
merchant ships to disrupt trade.

00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:02.844
It's a classic wartime maneuver.

00:16:02.845 --> 00:16:04.244
German U-boats
did the same thing.

00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:07.714
He's letting everyone know
Gran Colombia owns these waters.

00:16:07.715 --> 00:16:09.515
Relative bearing 2-2-0.

00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:13.724
Heading south again...
Definitely a search pattern.

00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:14.994
Probably wasn't expecting
to find us.

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:17.594
Now he has. At this range, sir,

00:16:17.595 --> 00:16:18.994
that ship
may not have I.D.'d us.

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.864
No, but they smell blood
in the water.

00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:22.664
Not activating
fire-control radar,

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.265
shooting down
their missile with CIWS...

00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.534
we tipped our hand.

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:28.335
This island
won't mask us forever.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:31.744
I'm starting by

00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:33.614
looking through
vulnerabilities in the system.

00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:35.275
You know Metcalfe's Law, sir?

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:37.684
It basically means the more
redundancies a system has,

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:38.945
the safer it is,

00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:40.614
but this hack
proved the opposite.

00:16:40.615 --> 00:16:42.084
Instead of being an asset,

00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:43.554
the redundancies
are actually what sank us...

00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:46.624
So Metcalfe's Law only
in reverse.

00:16:46.625 --> 00:16:48.424
The system
that was designed to protect us

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:49.824
is what destroyed us.
Yes, sir.

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:51.294
Sort of an
all-your-eggs-in-one-basket

00:16:51.295 --> 00:16:52.564
scenario, sir.

00:16:52.565 --> 00:16:54.294
Once the virus
got into the system,

00:16:54.295 --> 00:16:56.834
it used our redundancies and
spread across our entire network.

00:16:56.835 --> 00:16:59.165
So how'd it get into the system
in the first place?

00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:02.104
That I don't know...
yet.

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:04.174
Not till I can read the code
of the virus.

00:17:04.175 --> 00:17:06.644
Look, all I know is that
the worm was powerful...

00:17:06.645 --> 00:17:09.775
More powerful than anything
I've seen before.

00:17:12.915 --> 00:17:15.654
Gustavo's amassed
a huge South American army...

00:17:15.655 --> 00:17:17.454
40,000 troops at least.

00:17:17.455 --> 00:17:20.654
He's moving them north out of
Colombia across the Darien Gap.

00:17:20.655 --> 00:17:22.594
I thought it was impossible,

00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:24.464
nothing but swampland
and forest.

00:17:24.465 --> 00:17:26.125
It was until now.

00:17:26.135 --> 00:17:28.795
And Gustavo built the bridge.

00:17:28.805 --> 00:17:31.404
Once he gets his troops
across the Darien Gap,

00:17:31.405 --> 00:17:33.674
he'll be able to move them
all the way up to Mexico.

00:17:33.675 --> 00:17:35.404
How do you plan to stop them?

00:17:35.405 --> 00:17:37.144
- You're gonna blow up the bridge.
- That's right.

00:17:37.145 --> 00:17:39.405
Gustavo's troops arrive
at the Panama side tomorrow.

00:17:39.415 --> 00:17:40.545
That's when we strike.

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:44.344
Sounds like
just the kind of trouble

00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:46.145
we were looking for.

00:18:01.235 --> 00:18:03.764
Where do
all of these men come from?

00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:05.704
FARC, military defectors,

00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:07.705
even your average Joe citizen.

00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:13.645
And some are the same narcos
we used to take down.

00:18:14.985 --> 00:18:17.444
They're all the same side now.

00:18:17.445 --> 00:18:19.784
The only thing they hate
more than each other...

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:21.454
is Gustavo.

00:18:21.455 --> 00:18:24.324
I thought Tavo was supposed to
be a man of the people.

00:18:24.325 --> 00:18:25.654
Ah, he's like Escobar...

00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:27.654
Does just enough good
to maintain the myth.

00:18:27.655 --> 00:18:29.394
That's what keeps him in power.

00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:30.664
His ruthlessness, he hides.

00:18:30.665 --> 00:18:32.025
Come on.

00:18:34.595 --> 00:18:35.934
Sasha...

00:18:35.935 --> 00:18:38.004
this is as far as I go.

00:18:38.005 --> 00:18:39.534
What?
Where are you going?

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:40.874
I have a family, a son.

00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:42.735
I can't leave Panama like this.

00:18:42.745 --> 00:18:44.144
But I promised
to get you out safe.

00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:46.674
And you did.
Thank you for everything.

00:18:46.675 --> 00:18:48.014
No, no.

00:18:48.015 --> 00:18:51.015
On me.
Anything for CIA.

00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:55.015
Hey, be safe.

00:18:55.025 --> 00:18:57.955
You, too.

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:16.304
They're getting closer to us
and the supply ship.

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:18.644
We're faster.
We can make a run for it.

00:19:18.645 --> 00:19:21.244
Then we lose the chance
to refuel and resupply.

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:25.245
Last they saw, the U.S. fleet
was burning in Mayport.

00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:29.654
Seeing a warship out here
has got to have them wondering.

00:19:29.655 --> 00:19:31.225
"How many
did I miss?"

00:19:32.195 --> 00:19:33.794
"Who else
is out here?"

00:19:33.795 --> 00:19:35.395
We can use that
to our advantage.

00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:39.994
What do you have in mind?
They're looking for one ship.

00:19:39.995 --> 00:19:43.664
Let's show them
we got a whole fleet.

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:46.404
Eddie?
Why does our EMATT have a name?

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:48.874
Named after our C.O.'s
first boyfriend.

00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:50.404
She said
he always tried to pretend

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:51.605
to be bigger than he was.

00:19:51.615 --> 00:19:52.805
Oh, that's cold.

00:19:52.815 --> 00:19:54.274
So little Eddie is gonna pretend

00:19:54.275 --> 00:19:56.014
to be a big, bad submarine.

00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:58.014
When he shows up
on the bad guy's sonar,

00:19:58.015 --> 00:20:00.014
they're gonna crap their pants.

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:01.815
Ah, classic Eddie.

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.825
This is us.

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:06.824
The corvette is here.
Based on their search pattern,

00:20:06.825 --> 00:20:08.154
we can predict
where they're going next.

00:20:08.155 --> 00:20:10.294
We let them cross here.

00:20:10.295 --> 00:20:13.695
They'll run right into Eddie.

00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:22.774
Our one ship becomes two.

00:20:22.775 --> 00:20:24.304
If all goes right,

00:20:24.305 --> 00:20:28.445
Eddie will drive the corvette
this way towards the SLQ-49.

00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:39.725
Right here!

00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:47.264
Ready?

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:48.865
Yeah.
Heave!

00:20:59.275 --> 00:21:00.944
That is amazing.

00:21:00.945 --> 00:21:02.875
Rubber Duck's in position.

00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:10.624
Corvette's radar
hits the SLQ-49,

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:13.494
they'll think they're looking at
the broadside of a cruiser.

00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:15.155
Two ships become three.

00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:18.764
Our fleet
chases the lonely corvette here,

00:21:18.765 --> 00:21:21.765
where our frozen five-inch gun
is waiting.

00:21:24.565 --> 00:21:26.705
Eddie is in position, ma'am.

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:34.044
Seaman Bell, how long
have you been in the Navy?

00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:36.244
Three months tomorrow, sir.

00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:38.044
You've got your sea legs?

00:21:38.045 --> 00:21:39.584
Yes, sir.
Good.

00:21:39.585 --> 00:21:41.515
We're about to take on
a corvette class warship

00:21:41.525 --> 00:21:43.984
using only our five-inch.
Which can't move.

00:21:43.985 --> 00:21:46.724
The only way to aim it
is by steering the ship.

00:21:46.725 --> 00:21:49.395
We're using the ship
as a rifle, sir?

00:21:50.595 --> 00:21:52.864
I grew up in Texas.
Been hunting my whole life.

00:21:52.865 --> 00:21:54.864
Never thought about it
like that,

00:21:54.865 --> 00:21:56.534
but, yeah, that's about right.
All right.

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:58.004
The ship's our rifle.

00:21:58.005 --> 00:22:00.874
This is our gun sight.
We're your spotters.

00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:03.544
Commander Burk and I will call
out course corrections to you.

00:22:03.545 --> 00:22:07.214
As soon as that corvette comes
in our crosshairs, we fire.

00:22:07.215 --> 00:22:08.814
Any questions, Bell?

00:22:08.815 --> 00:22:10.814
No, sir.
I'm ready.

00:22:10.815 --> 00:22:12.345
Good.

00:22:12.355 --> 00:22:14.985
Let's go hunting.

00:22:18.455 --> 00:22:23.095
<i>Mexico stands firm
against atrocity and tyranny.</i>

00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:26.125
<i>Gustavo Barros does not speak
for all Latin Americans.</i>

00:22:26.135 --> 00:22:28.134
<i>After the horrors
of the past few years,</i>

00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:30.334
<i>we should be
counting our blessings</i>

00:22:30.335 --> 00:22:33.534
<i>and coming together as one,
regardless of our latitude.</i>

00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:35.404
<i>War is not the answer,</i>

00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:39.344
<i>and Gran Colombia's aggression
in the Gulf must be stopped.</i>

00:22:39.345 --> 00:22:41.014
Mexico is the key.

00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:43.344
Gustavo can't win the continent
without it.

00:22:43.345 --> 00:22:45.884
That's got to be
Gran Colombia's next move.

00:22:45.885 --> 00:22:48.484
He's just gonna leapfrog
over Central America?

00:22:48.485 --> 00:22:51.024
Mexico falls,
the rest will follow.

00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:53.554
Centers of gravity.

00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:55.894
Centers of gravity.

00:22:55.895 --> 00:22:57.494
Here.

00:22:57.495 --> 00:22:59.895
Costa Hirviendo.

00:23:02.035 --> 00:23:03.764
Mexico's largest oil terminal.

00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:06.504
It supplies fuel to airports
and military bases

00:23:06.505 --> 00:23:07.704
all over North America.

00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:08.904
If Gustavo took that,

00:23:08.905 --> 00:23:10.304
he wouldn't just cripple Mexico.

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.044
He'd have enough fuel
to move his army

00:23:12.045 --> 00:23:14.775
and his entire fleet north
right into our backyard.

00:23:14.785 --> 00:23:16.314
We need to defend that terminal.

00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:17.584
With what?

00:23:17.585 --> 00:23:20.254
These plans assume
a 300-ship Navy,

00:23:20.255 --> 00:23:23.054
a standing Army,
and a working Air Force,

00:23:23.055 --> 00:23:24.785
not to mention a fighting force

00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:26.324
of a million soldiers
and sailors.

00:23:26.325 --> 00:23:28.394
Admiral Chandler, I have
nothing but respect for you,

00:23:28.395 --> 00:23:30.464
but my objection still stands.

00:23:30.465 --> 00:23:32.794
We need all our people
protecting our own border.

00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:34.864
Our borders are weak and porous.

00:23:34.865 --> 00:23:36.404
You said it yourself, General.

00:23:36.405 --> 00:23:38.534
Your own troops are spread thin.

00:23:38.535 --> 00:23:40.404
If we don't stop them
down south,

00:23:40.405 --> 00:23:43.004
they will cut us in half
at the Texas border.

00:23:43.005 --> 00:23:44.744
And what about our allies?

00:23:44.745 --> 00:23:47.344
We can't just abandon them.

00:23:47.345 --> 00:23:51.484
If we were to try
and defend the terminal...

00:23:51.485 --> 00:23:54.414
Anita, are you
seriously considering this?

00:23:54.415 --> 00:23:56.084
You lost hundreds of Marines
in Mayport.

00:23:56.085 --> 00:23:57.954
It's because of
the Marines I lost

00:23:57.955 --> 00:23:59.885
I'm considering this, Don.

00:23:59.895 --> 00:24:02.094
Admiral, Don's right.

00:24:02.095 --> 00:24:04.625
We don't have
the logistical infrastructure

00:24:04.635 --> 00:24:07.094
to support
a huge operation down there,

00:24:07.095 --> 00:24:10.965
but if we were,
what do you have in mind?

00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:16.235
We send <i>Nathan James</i>
to the Gulf...

00:24:16.245 --> 00:24:19.505
then supplement with troops
from the other branches.

00:24:19.515 --> 00:24:22.044
Admiral, no one is questioning
the contribution

00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:24.444
your ship has made
to this country, but...

00:24:24.445 --> 00:24:25.514
they're one ship.

00:24:25.515 --> 00:24:27.784
You haven't even
heard from them.

00:24:27.785 --> 00:24:29.855
They'll call.

00:24:30.925 --> 00:24:35.394
So, you're asking us to throw
the football down the field

00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:36.924
and just hope
there's a receiver there.

00:24:36.925 --> 00:24:38.124
Yes.

00:24:38.125 --> 00:24:39.525
Because I know them.

00:24:39.535 --> 00:24:42.134
They're always there
to catch the ball.

00:24:42.135 --> 00:24:43.665
Anita?

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.674
I'm sorry, Tom.

00:24:48.675 --> 00:24:51.874
Maybe if...
When we hear from <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:24:51.875 --> 00:24:54.274
Until we do, I can't,
in good conscience,

00:24:54.275 --> 00:24:55.875
take my troops from the border.

00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:57.084
The Navy runs
this joint command,

00:24:57.085 --> 00:24:58.484
so it's your call.

00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:01.414
But if this is the plan
you're recommending to CNC,

00:25:01.415 --> 00:25:03.615
I'm afraid it will be
without my signature.

00:25:15.505 --> 00:25:17.364
Corvette is approaching
Eddie's position, ma'am.

00:25:17.365 --> 00:25:20.704
Activate Eddie!
EMATT is active.

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:22.104
Sonar?
Confirmed, ma'am.

00:25:22.105 --> 00:25:23.705
EMATT is emitting and on course.

00:25:26.515 --> 00:25:29.444
Corvette is adjusting course,
ma'am.

00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:31.784
They're running away from the EMATT.
It's working.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:33.584
Corvette knows it's no match
for a sub.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:36.054
We need to keep selling it.
Shut Eddie down.

00:25:36.055 --> 00:25:37.524
Make them think it's gone dark.

00:25:37.525 --> 00:25:39.924
Yes, ma'am.

00:25:39.925 --> 00:25:41.594
Corvette took the bait.

00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:44.664
How long till they see
the SLQ-49?

00:25:44.665 --> 00:25:47.134
Should be on their radar
seven minutes, sir.

00:25:47.135 --> 00:25:48.864
And if they fall for our trick,

00:25:48.865 --> 00:25:51.735
they should be within firing
range five minutes after that.

00:26:18.495 --> 00:26:22.095
I can't believe
you're still in the fight.

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:23.364
I figured you would have retired

00:26:23.365 --> 00:26:24.834
after what you did on the <i>James,</i>

00:26:24.835 --> 00:26:27.834
but here you are
in the middle of the jungle...

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:29.104
Still a warrior.

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:30.774
Why is that so hard
to understand, huh?

00:26:30.775 --> 00:26:32.574
You, of all people, can relate.

00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:35.444
Me, I got nothing else
to live for but to fight,

00:26:35.445 --> 00:26:37.384
but you...
You got a wife, a kid.

00:26:37.385 --> 00:26:38.714
If I had your life,

00:26:38.715 --> 00:26:40.514
I sure as shit
wouldn't be doing this anymore.

00:26:40.515 --> 00:26:43.384
Anyway, I'm getting out soon...

00:26:43.385 --> 00:26:45.185
Back to the states.

00:26:45.195 --> 00:26:47.124
The narcos have a plane.

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:49.524
It makes runs
to northern Mexico.

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:51.194
The narcos are your exfil?

00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:53.325
Their planes are
a hell of a lot more reliable

00:26:53.335 --> 00:26:54.534
than most airlines today.

00:26:54.535 --> 00:26:56.064
Theirs leaves
from a mountain clearing

00:26:56.065 --> 00:26:57.534
two days from now.

00:26:57.535 --> 00:26:59.204
We hit Tavo's men hard,
take out the bridge,

00:26:59.205 --> 00:27:00.734
and I get on the plane
with my intel.

00:27:00.735 --> 00:27:03.404
You and your team...
You're welcome to hitch a ride.

00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:06.274
Yeah.
We might just do that.

00:27:06.275 --> 00:27:08.615
All right.

00:27:14.755 --> 00:27:17.755
Ma'am, the corvette
is approaching the SLQ-49.

00:27:21.025 --> 00:27:22.224
It's working.

00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:24.895
Corvette is turning towards us.

00:27:25.835 --> 00:27:29.695
The corvette will be in range
in three minutes, sir.

00:27:29.705 --> 00:27:30.964
Very well.

00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:32.235
According to plan.

00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:36.844
Relax, Bell.

00:27:36.845 --> 00:27:38.845
You know you can't hunt
when you're tight.

00:27:43.915 --> 00:27:45.784
Ma'am, the corvette
is adjusting course.

00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:47.655
It's moving away
from the SLQ-49.

00:27:49.055 --> 00:27:51.654
Where's it heading?
Prop noise indicates

00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:53.585
it's now approaching the island
from the west.

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.594
Yes, ma'am.

00:27:56.595 --> 00:27:58.865
They know we're here.

00:28:01.865 --> 00:28:04.004
Now what?
We improvise.

00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:06.265
No plan survives contact
with the enemy.

00:28:06.275 --> 00:28:08.735
Sir, we still have
one more card to play.

00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:10.004
Speed.

00:28:10.005 --> 00:28:11.744
We chase them down
and take them on in open water.

00:28:11.745 --> 00:28:13.874
This is the only island cover
for 30 miles, sir.

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:16.275
We'll have one shot
to catch them by surprise.

00:28:16.285 --> 00:28:19.084
One shot's all we'll need. Your job
just got a hell of a lot harder.

00:28:19.085 --> 00:28:21.284
It's one thing to fire
from a fixed position,

00:28:21.285 --> 00:28:22.554
another thing to do it
on the move.

00:28:22.555 --> 00:28:24.154
You up for it? Bell:
Absolutely, sir.

00:28:24.155 --> 00:28:26.354
Hunting's no fun
if the game comes to you.

00:28:26.355 --> 00:28:29.355
Good.
Take us into open water.

00:28:42.575 --> 00:28:45.105
Hey, Pablo's got
a ride out of here.

00:28:45.115 --> 00:28:46.574
This all goes to plan,

00:28:46.575 --> 00:28:49.115
we can blow the bridge up and...

00:29:08.865 --> 00:29:11.664
Kandie! She's alive! Let's move!

00:29:11.665 --> 00:29:13.004
I need to find Pablo!

00:29:13.005 --> 00:29:16.944
Danny! I'll be right behind you.

00:29:16.945 --> 00:29:18.874
Pablo!

00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:20.814
Pablo!

00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:22.414
Pablo!

00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:24.014
Danny!
Hey!

00:29:24.015 --> 00:29:26.084
Danny.

00:29:26.085 --> 00:29:28.754
I'm gonna get you out of here. Just
hang on. No. Danny, you got to go.

00:29:28.755 --> 00:29:31.024
I'm not leaving you!

00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:35.094
Aah!

00:29:35.095 --> 00:29:36.964
Come on.

00:29:36.965 --> 00:29:38.765
Come on.

00:30:06.255 --> 00:30:07.455
Azima. Azima.

00:30:09.595 --> 00:30:12.194
I'm good. I'm good. Okay, okay.

00:30:12.195 --> 00:30:13.864
How did they find us?

00:30:13.865 --> 00:30:15.595
Where the hell is Green?

00:30:27.415 --> 00:30:29.445
Going somewhere, gringo?

00:30:59.915 --> 00:31:01.245
Huh?

00:31:10.525 --> 00:31:12.785
<i>Muy bien.</i>

00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:36.414
We have a visual.

00:31:36.415 --> 00:31:39.014
Bell, two degrees left.

00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:40.755
Got it.

00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:43.755
- Now.
- Fire.

00:31:50.895 --> 00:31:52.094
Hey, gringo.

00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:54.935
Are you okay letting
your Latin friends die for you?

00:32:04.575 --> 00:32:07.374
One last chance.

00:32:07.375 --> 00:32:10.185
Where is Armando?

00:32:11.585 --> 00:32:17.454
<i>Yo no hablo ingles...</i>

00:32:17.455 --> 00:32:20.455
asshole.

00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:26.725
No!

00:32:26.735 --> 00:32:27.864
You son of a bitch!

00:32:27.865 --> 00:32:31.065
Son of a bitch!

00:32:32.535 --> 00:32:34.004
We clipped her stern.

00:32:34.005 --> 00:32:35.935
One degree left.

00:32:38.215 --> 00:32:39.475
- Now!
- Fire!

00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:45.014
Shots landing short.

00:32:45.015 --> 00:32:47.485
We have to fire on the rise.
Wait for it.

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:52.954
I have hydrophone effects.
Torpedo inbound.

00:32:52.955 --> 00:32:54.954
Ma'am, what do we do?
Our MK 116 is down.

00:32:54.955 --> 00:32:56.824
The corvette thought
Eddie was a sub.

00:32:56.825 --> 00:32:58.764
Let's make the torpedo
believe the same thing.

00:32:58.765 --> 00:33:01.295
Reactivate EMATT.
Aye, ma'am.

00:33:14.975 --> 00:33:17.984
We have detonation.
Torpedo destroyed.

00:33:17.985 --> 00:33:19.855
EMATT signal has disappeared.

00:33:20.785 --> 00:33:22.784
Pour one out for Eddie.

00:33:22.785 --> 00:33:24.125
At least he's good
for <i>something.</i>

00:33:29.265 --> 00:33:31.794
Ah.

00:33:31.795 --> 00:33:34.064
I know who you are.

00:33:34.065 --> 00:33:37.705
<i>Sí. Sí.</i>

00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:46.144
Oh, man.

00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:49.544
Gustavo's got a big bounty
on your head.

00:33:49.545 --> 00:33:50.884
You know that?

00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:55.484
They said dead or alive.

00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:58.025
If it's all the same to you...

00:33:59.555 --> 00:34:01.425
I'm thinking dead.

00:34:29.855 --> 00:34:31.654
Four degrees right, Bell.

00:34:31.655 --> 00:34:34.254
I'm there.

00:34:34.255 --> 00:34:36.724
Wait for it.

00:34:36.725 --> 00:34:39.265
Now.
Fire!

00:34:41.805 --> 00:34:44.405
Brace!
Incoming!

00:34:49.745 --> 00:34:52.205
Battle damage assessment.

00:34:54.675 --> 00:34:56.944
We gotta lead him.

00:34:56.945 --> 00:34:59.345
Bell, what do you do
when you're hunting bird?

00:34:59.355 --> 00:35:00.614
Aim in front of them, sir.

00:35:00.615 --> 00:35:03.484
Left rudder, four degrees.
Aim for my thumb.

00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:05.084
Yes, sir!

00:35:05.085 --> 00:35:06.555
I'm there.

00:35:07.625 --> 00:35:08.755
Now!
Fire!

00:35:08.765 --> 00:35:12.095
Two rounds.

00:35:21.975 --> 00:35:23.774
We have detonation.

00:35:23.775 --> 00:35:25.174
The ship is breaking apart.

00:35:25.175 --> 00:35:29.115
Target destroyed, ma'am.

00:35:47.595 --> 00:35:49.395
Hell of a job, Bell.

00:35:49.405 --> 00:35:50.934
Thank you, sir.

00:35:50.935 --> 00:35:53.135
Same to you,
if you don't mind me saying.

00:35:56.475 --> 00:35:58.545
Damage report!

00:37:35.345 --> 00:37:37.145
<i>IViva Tavo!</i>

00:38:47.945 --> 00:38:50.545
You all right?

00:38:51.045 --> 00:38:52.784
Aah!

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:55.054
22 dead, our camp destroyed,

00:38:55.055 --> 00:38:58.324
and we lost most of our weapons
and explosives.

00:38:58.325 --> 00:39:00.124
Do you have reinforcements?

00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:02.455
They're scattered
across the jungle, days away.

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:04.994
So we find another moment
and make a play...

00:39:04.995 --> 00:39:07.064
No.
There's too many of them.

00:39:07.065 --> 00:39:08.795
I don't think we can manage...

00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:10.404
I'm not turning back.

00:39:10.405 --> 00:39:13.674
Not now.

00:39:13.675 --> 00:39:15.074
Danny, we can't just keep...

00:39:15.075 --> 00:39:17.674
If Gustavo gets his troops
across that bridge,

00:39:17.675 --> 00:39:18.875
it's game over, right?

00:39:23.015 --> 00:39:25.685
That's right.

00:39:28.155 --> 00:39:30.485
I'm not ready
to concede the game.

00:39:32.225 --> 00:39:34.154
None of you have to stay.

00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:36.625
But Pablo gave his life
for this mission.

00:39:38.035 --> 00:39:40.565
I plan to finish it.

00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:46.904
Right.

00:39:46.905 --> 00:39:49.575
Then let's blow up that bridge.

00:40:03.385 --> 00:40:08.455
Ma'am, O.O.D. wishes to report
we have hull integrity.

00:40:08.465 --> 00:40:10.124
They're patching and repairing
damage from the enemy ship.

00:40:10.125 --> 00:40:12.064
In addition, the replenishment
is now complete.

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.664
Requesting permission to untie.

00:40:13.665 --> 00:40:14.935
Very well.

00:40:16.605 --> 00:40:18.134
They put quite a hole
in our side.

00:40:18.135 --> 00:40:20.134
Four feet to the left,
it hits our fuel lines.

00:40:20.135 --> 00:40:22.404
Now that we're loaded up,
we need to call Southcom,

00:40:22.405 --> 00:40:24.074
tell them we're ready
to join the fight.

00:40:24.075 --> 00:40:25.805
How?
We've got no crypto.

00:40:25.815 --> 00:40:27.875
It's still too risky to talk
on an open channel. No.

00:40:27.885 --> 00:40:29.945
We need a code.

00:40:41.095 --> 00:40:42.555
<i>Command Cent...</i>

00:40:42.565 --> 00:40:45.294
<i>Command, come in.
Do you read?</i>

00:40:45.295 --> 00:40:46.625
<i>Command.</i>

00:40:47.835 --> 00:40:50.234
<i>Command Center, come in.</i>

00:40:50.235 --> 00:40:51.634
Admiral Chandler?

00:40:51.635 --> 00:40:54.974
There's a call coming in
over HF radio.

00:40:54.975 --> 00:40:56.635
It's Admiral Slattery.

00:41:01.715 --> 00:41:03.514
This isn't
a secure channel, Mike.

00:41:03.515 --> 00:41:04.984
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

00:41:04.985 --> 00:41:08.254
<i>I finally got around
to reading your favorite book.</i>

00:41:08.255 --> 00:41:09.715
You got your copy handy?

00:41:09.725 --> 00:41:11.124
Hold on.

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:13.454
Ensign Swain, do you have
your copy of "Moby-Dick"?

00:41:13.455 --> 00:41:14.654
Yes, sir.

00:41:14.655 --> 00:41:15.855
We've got it.

00:41:15.865 --> 00:41:19.464
Turn to page 366,
5 paragraphs down.

00:41:19.465 --> 00:41:20.994
Last 4 words.

00:41:20.995 --> 00:41:22.664
<i>Working on it.</i>

00:41:22.665 --> 00:41:24.064
<i>This is how we're gonna
have to communicate</i>

00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:25.334
<i>for the time being.</i>

00:41:25.335 --> 00:41:27.935
Understood.
Smart play, Mike.

00:41:27.945 --> 00:41:30.605
Well?
What's the message?

00:41:32.675 --> 00:41:33.874
"Fit for a fight."

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:37.014
<i>Tom, is the message clear?</i>

00:41:37.015 --> 00:41:38.214
Yes, it is.

00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:41.615
We read you loud and clear.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:44.425
We'll be in touch.
