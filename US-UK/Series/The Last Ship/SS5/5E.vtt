WEBVTT

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.330
Previously on "The Last Ship"...

00:00:01.388 --> 00:00:03.514
Where the hell are you, Gustavo?

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:05.599
Bearing 0-9-0 at 30 miles!

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:07.098
It's a battleship.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.978
Take Gustavo's war plans back to
the States and let us win this.

00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:15.764
So much for the safe route.

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:20.022
- We have to turn back.
- We can't let them get away.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.584
I cannot allow us to reenter
the fight in our condition.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.351
Captain's right.
It's suicide, Tom.

00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:29.450
The ship is no longer a threat.
We are winning, Tavo.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.782
Clear.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.783
Clear!

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:51.851
Clear!

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.318
Vulture, this is Cobra.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.987
Vulture, this is Cobra, over!

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:58.256
Vulture, nothing heard!
I send in the blind.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.858
Cellar's secure.
Just the one door.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.237
It will make
for a decent hideout.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.795
Vulture, this is Cobra,
do you copy?

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:04.129
Verify position, over!

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:05.597
Damn it!

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.799
Where the hell are they?!

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:07.800
They must have run in to trouble

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:08.801
exfiling the HVT.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.535
No one saw this coming.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.250
The Jamaicans won't be able
to hold out much longer

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.518
if we don't get off this island
soon!

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.222
How the hell did Gustavo know
we were here?

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.343
Maybe he didn't.

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.412
If Gustavo didn't come here
for us,

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:21.613
he came to invade.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:24.016
Which means he brought an army.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.953
No, I do not think
we're losing this war.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.689
We're at a stalemate.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.825
The line is holding here

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.227
at the Tropic of Cancer.
And in my...

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.762
Last Thursday,
two U.S. Navy patrol ships,

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.632
the<i> USS Cyclone</i>
and the<i> USS Firebolt,</i>

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.235
defended Nassau
from a covert landing attempt

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.636
by Grand Colombian troops.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.571
Joint operation
did occur yesterday

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.440
between the Marines
and the Army.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109
That is a testament
to our training,

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:53.512
our tactical superiority,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.715
and, frankly, the resolve
of our armed forces

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.050
and those of our allies.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.918
We encourage everyone
to stay vigilant.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.520
And, please,
obey all blackout rules.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.656
The answer to your question
is yes.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.591
I am back full-time.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.261
But let me be clear,
I'm not running the war.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.640
I'm a team player,
and I'm here to serve

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.931
at the pleasure
of the Commander in Chief.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.511
This group here is
the best and brightest,

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.135
and I'm proud
to stand with them.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:20.072
Now, I can't promise
the fight won't be hard,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.074
and I can't say
it will end any time soon.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.343
But I can say
with absolute certainty...

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:26.945
we will prevail.

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:56.308
You did a hell of a job getting

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.176
our weapons systems
back online, Ensign.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.311
Thank you, sir.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.779
Any update on the virus?

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.380
I traced the second part
of the virus,

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.583
the one that did all the damage,
to an Internet cafe

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.651
in Medellin, Colombia.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:06.919
No surprises there.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:09.254
Not really. I've been able
to create an algorithm

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:11.056
to monitor all traffic
out of the region

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.458
to any cell tower
or Internet portal

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:14.993
in our region.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:16.595
It's all thanks to Alisha.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.398
Commander Granderson...

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:22.734
Son, you couldn't have prevented
what happened to Alisha.

00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:24.002
I was almost there, sir.

00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:25.448
If I was able to test
her card earlier,

00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:27.071
I could have just...
Could have what,

00:03:27.073 --> 00:03:28.807
figured out
that her live-in girlfriend

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.409
was a mole for Gustavo?

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:33.678
No, that woman
had everyone fooled.

00:03:33.747 --> 00:03:35.948
But we're onto her now,
thanks to you and Alisha.

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:37.950
She can't make a move
without us finding her.

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.551
That's right, sir.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.220
Losing friends
is what makes war war.

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:43.822
We honor them
by continuing to fight

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.001
so we don't lose anyone else.

00:03:45.025 --> 00:03:46.291
Yes, sir.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.026
You're doing your part.

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.762
Thank you, Admiral.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.229
Yes, I know it's not working.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:52.497
I'm heading there now.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.166
- Hey.
- It's looking good, Mike.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.769
Getting there. Amazing
what a good nose job will do.

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:58.036
And the Michener?

00:03:58.105 --> 00:03:59.437
She'll be carrying
as many Marines

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:00.883
as we can muster
in a few weeks' time.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:02.841
The U.S. Navy may be down,
but we're not out.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.843
Damn right. Besides,

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.022
it's not the ships that count,

00:04:06.046 --> 00:04:07.445
it's the warriors they carry.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.984
Yeah, say again,
I can't hear ya.

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:13.185
Vulture, this is Cobra.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.787
Come in, Vulture!

00:04:14.855 --> 00:04:15.988
It's not letting up.

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.590
Well, we got two hammers
and a machete...

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.058
and a shitload of rum.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.794
Vulture, this is Cobra.
Over!

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:23.862
We should E&E out of here
and find our boys.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.665
No way! Gustavo's got
too many men out there.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.293
Better to go straight
for extract Alpha,

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.534
hope Vulture's already there.

00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:32.871
- And if they're not?
- Cross that bridge.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.272
<i>Cobra, Vulture.</i>

00:04:34.341 --> 00:04:35.740
<i>They're coming.</i>

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.075
Yeah, we copy!

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.811
What's your Goddamn whiskey?

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.078
<i>We ran into trouble.</i>

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.347
<i>The Jamaicans' line...
Crumbling.</i>

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.483
Yeah, we know.
We ducked into a hideout,

00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.219
a rum cellar six mikes
east of the compound.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.620
Can you make it?

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:49.954
<i>Affirmative.</i>

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.156
<i>We're on our way.</i>

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.691
And the high-value target?

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:58.963
Vulture, do you copy?

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:00.432
The high-value target?!

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:02.767
Dr. Manuel Montano...

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:05.838
Gustavo's chief war strategist,
author of Plan Azul.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.040
My team just received intel
from the rebels

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.241
that Montano's in Jamaica.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.442
All right, why Jamaica?

00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:11.976
They've been
aggressively neutral

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.245
since the war started.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:16.048
Gustavo must have sent Montano
to show them his plans,

00:05:16.116 --> 00:05:17.516
try to get them
to join his side.

00:05:17.584 --> 00:05:19.518
Maybe they're already
considering flipping.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:22.254
I met Montano once
at a conference pre-plague.

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.322
He's a brilliant
tactical theorist.

00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:25.724
If you hadn't stolen Plan Azul,

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.126
we'd most likely be
in full retreat by now.

00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:29.594
Word is he's working
on a sequel.

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:31.463
Mr. President, Montano
could be the key

00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.931
to breaking the stalemate.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.066
Now, assemble a team,

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.068
extract Montano from Jamaica,

00:05:36.136 --> 00:05:37.402
find out what he knows.

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.304
I'll lead the team myself.

00:05:41.676 --> 00:05:43.808
I know the man, I can get him
to talk to me.

00:05:43.878 --> 00:05:46.078
You can talk to him
once he's on U.S. soil.

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:47.345
If we do it in Jamaica, sir,

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.814
Gustavo won't have to know
we have his man.

00:05:49.816 --> 00:05:50.949
That will buy us time.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.885
We could break the stalemate
with Gran Colombia

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:56.188
before they have a chance
to change their war plans.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.692
Give us the room.

00:06:14.575 --> 00:06:16.374
I keep expecting Alisha
to walk in here

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:19.778
with that big smile of hers
and...

00:06:19.846 --> 00:06:20.779
Three months,

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:22.492
and they're not closer
to catching her killer.

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:24.616
You mean her fiancée.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.322
Meylan has NCIS scouring
the country for her.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.124
She won't get away with this.

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:34.159
Sometimes bad people do.

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:39.732
There is a full-on war
happening out there...

00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:44.536
and I'm not a part of it.

00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:50.943
I went back on active duty to
fight this thing until the end.

00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.611
Three months... three months,

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:54.479
and I'm still pushing papers.

00:06:54.548 --> 00:06:56.615
I mean, we gotta make a move.

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.683
You need to come see Frankie.

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:02.755
Use the time
while you're still home.

00:07:02.823 --> 00:07:04.356
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.

00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.291
You've only seen him twice.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.893
He knows you're around.
I know.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:11.296
How am I supposed to explain
that to a five-year-old?

00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:16.501
You're his father, Danny.

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:18.570
Please, don't turn me
into the bad guy here.

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.816
But we keep having
this conversation...

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.273
You're not the bad guy,
I know that.

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:27.045
I'll come see him.

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:28.647
I promise.

00:07:38.325 --> 00:07:39.391
What was that about?

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.126
POTUS doesn't want me
going after Montano.

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:45.197
I'm a symbol
of the war effort now.

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:48.000
He thinks it's too dangerous.

00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:49.868
And what did you say to that?

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:51.336
I said he was right.

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:53.005
Give me a hand.

00:07:53.073 --> 00:07:54.073
I got it, I got it.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.075
You guys okay?
We're fine.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.143
What's wrong with him?

00:07:58.212 --> 00:07:59.344
He took a bullet.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.813
Put him down over here.

00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:06.218
Gustavo's men
are taking the island.

00:08:06.286 --> 00:08:07.686
Salem beach is blown.

00:08:07.754 --> 00:08:09.954
That was our extract.

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:11.289
Not anymore.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.812
You've done this 35 times?

00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:35.146
Give or take.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.150
You nervous, little brother?

00:08:39.152 --> 00:08:40.586
Hell, no.

00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.889
They're here!

00:08:43.957 --> 00:08:45.957
Everyone, they're here!

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:48.293
Come on in, come on in.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.829
Well, aren't you boys a sight!

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:53.031
Afternoon, ma'am.
Miss Abbott.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.433
Charlene.

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.301
You gentlemen
are far more handsome

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.437
than your photos,
if that's even possible.

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.707
Right this way, let's not keep
your fans waiting.

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:03.975
The Southern Women's Society
has been working hard

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.977
to set up this function
for y'all.

00:09:05.979 --> 00:09:07.979
There are some
deep pockets here,

00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.181
and everyone just wants
to do their part

00:09:10.183 --> 00:09:11.183
for the war effort.

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:12.317
We are grateful, ma'am,

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:13.919
and we're honored to be here.

00:09:13.987 --> 00:09:16.655
Oh, we're just thrilled
to have you.

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:18.723
All right, y'all, gather round.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:21.526
Le's show these fine fellows
from the<i> Nathan James</i>

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:24.596
some good Southern hospitality.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:29.668
Where the hell are we?

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.803
Forget where are we.
When are we?

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:34.005
Just smile and be
who they want you to be.

00:09:34.007 --> 00:09:36.407
Every dollar raised
is another sailor fed,

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.077
another shell in the five-inch.

00:09:38.145 --> 00:09:41.546
It's such an honor to meet
a true American hero, Commander.

00:09:41.615 --> 00:09:43.014
Well, thank you, ma'am.

00:09:43.016 --> 00:09:44.816
And thank you
for all you do for the cause.

00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.351
Of course!

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:52.691
I am amazed.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.027
You all have saved the world
three times now.

00:09:56.097 --> 00:09:58.097
How on earth do you do it?

00:09:58.165 --> 00:10:00.632
Nothing special
about any of us, sir.

00:10:00.634 --> 00:10:01.744
Just following the training
provided

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.302
by your United States Navy.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.610
Just happened to be in the
right place at the right time.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.506
Well, I've missed
the last few wars.

00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:09.308
Would have signed up
for this one.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.575
Bad knees.

00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:12.511
God, I really want to be in it.

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.114
Edmund, go make a donation.

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:16.315
Don't mind Edmund.

00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:17.426
He's got chickens in the yard,

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:18.583
if you know what I mean.

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:25.857
Do you miss being
out at sea, son?

00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:27.726
Oh, I'm just happy
to do my part, ma'am,

00:10:27.795 --> 00:10:29.661
wherever that may be.
Oh, I bet you're happy

00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:32.798
to be at home for a spell,
sleeping in your own bed...

00:10:32.866 --> 00:10:34.599
Wearing a set
of clean underwear.

00:10:34.668 --> 00:10:36.535
Yes, ma'am, I sure am.

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:38.403
Tell me, to whom do I write
the check?

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.339
Oh, the U.S. War Bonds
Department.

00:10:40.407 --> 00:10:42.541
Thank you, ma'am.

00:10:42.609 --> 00:10:44.543
Now, where is that checkbook?

00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.346
Let me help you
with that, Grandma.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.415
Thank you.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.018
Hi.

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:55.620
Hello.

00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.157
Courtney Anne,
you didn't offer our guest

00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.491
any of our sweet tea.

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:01.360
Mother.

00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:02.995
Thank you, ma'am.

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:09.701
Pegasus 2-8-8, Vulture,

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.102
extract Alpha has been blown.

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:12.172
Must divert to Bravo.

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.772
Do you copy?
Over.

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:17.776
So we got peaches,
tomatoes, beans...

00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:21.312
and enough rum to throw
one hell of a victory party.

00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:23.048
Oh, snap!
Is that rhubarb?

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.187
Hey, there.

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.857
Hey, buddy.

00:11:31.925 --> 00:11:33.292
Hey.

00:11:33.994 --> 00:11:35.660
Come in, Pegasus 2-8-8.

00:11:35.729 --> 00:11:37.262
This is Vulture, over.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:38.663
<i>Reading you now, Vulture.</i>

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.465
<i>Adjusting course.
New coordinates,</i>

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:42.133
<i>extract Bravo, over.</i>

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.869
We got 40 minutes
to get him moving...

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.205
Less if the Jamaicans
can't hold the line.

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:48.339
But we still don't have
a clear path out.

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.141
I'm not going anywhere.

00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:51.877
And I'm not saying anything.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.479
Looks infected.

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:55.614
He might not live, sir.

00:11:55.682 --> 00:11:57.082
He'll live.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.084
We've got things to talk about.

00:12:00.287 --> 00:12:01.352
Hey!
Harder!

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:02.422
Hey!
Harder!

00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:05.091
Keep it going!

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:07.092
Harder, harder!
Come on, let's go.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.427
I said harder!

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:09.761
Harder!

00:12:09.763 --> 00:12:10.962
Much more than this!

00:12:19.172 --> 00:12:20.239
How do you feel?

00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.506
I'm good.

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.707
It's pretty good.

00:12:22.776 --> 00:12:24.175
You're more than good.

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:25.711
You are a weapon, baby.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:28.047
Nothing can stop you.

00:12:28.115 --> 00:12:30.315
Not with you around anyway.

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:44.796
Daddy, do you see me?!

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.466
Yeah, I see you, bud.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.540
I thought Clay
already swept Alisha's laptop.

00:12:55.609 --> 00:12:57.142
Six times.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.877
The woman can't just disappear.

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.080
What about her sister, huh?
Anyone talk to her?

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:03.214
She hasn't heard from Kelsi
in years,

00:13:03.284 --> 00:13:06.952
which, I guess, makes sense.

00:13:11.358 --> 00:13:14.693
God. Danny, I let that girl
babysit for me.

00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:15.939
Yeah, well, it just goes
to show,

00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:17.963
you never really know people.

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:22.567
Frankie!

00:13:24.105 --> 00:13:25.036
Give me that.

00:13:25.038 --> 00:13:27.506
- Mama!
- It's okay, sweetie.

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:29.108
Okay.

00:13:56.804 --> 00:13:58.469
We'll find Montano here...

00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:01.072
An old resort two clicks
south of Runaway Bay.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:03.474
Our intel suggests
he's traveling without security

00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:04.743
under an assumed name.

00:14:04.812 --> 00:14:07.012
The Jamaican Defense force
has agreed to help infil you

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.747
to the target,
then get you out again.

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:10.281
They're our allies on this.

00:14:10.283 --> 00:14:11.350
Okay.

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:12.684
We drop the team here,

00:14:12.753 --> 00:14:13.885
short swim from the beach.

00:14:13.954 --> 00:14:15.198
If the Jamaicans
keep that clear,

00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:16.755
we'll set extract Alpha here.

00:14:16.824 --> 00:14:19.024
Good.
We'll put Bravo here.

00:14:19.092 --> 00:14:20.425
But let's hope we don't need it.

00:14:20.494 --> 00:14:21.760
Worst comes to worst, we have

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:24.095
a forward operating Marine base
in Haiti

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:25.564
with three Super-Stallions
packed up

00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:28.267
and ready to move.
Helos, good.

00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.370
Ash?

00:14:31.438 --> 00:14:34.373
Ash, wait.

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:35.640
Where are you going?

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:36.886
If you didn't have time
to see me,

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.070
you should have just told me.

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:39.422
I've been here
for an hour and a half.

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:43.114
I know, I'm sorry.
Won't be much longer.

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.450
You hungry? I can have someone
run down to the commissary.

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:48.053
Dad, it's fine.

00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:49.855
Okay.

00:14:49.923 --> 00:14:51.590
I'll be done here soon.

00:14:51.658 --> 00:14:53.458
I'll see you at home.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.539
We gotta move now.

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:08.673
How's Montano?

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.341
We're gonna have
to carry him out.

00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:13.144
Fever's down, but he's out cold.

00:15:13.146 --> 00:15:14.479
Last report from the Jamaicans

00:15:14.548 --> 00:15:17.015
had an enemy QRF coming in
from the west.

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:19.284
I recommend this route to Bravo.

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:20.685
<i>Vulture, this is Pegasus,</i>

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:22.421
<i>requesting a sit-rep, over.</i>

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:23.622
Roger that, Pegasus.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.024
We're 10 minutes out, over.

00:15:26.093 --> 00:15:27.626
Pegasus, do you copy?

00:15:27.694 --> 00:15:28.894
<i>Stand by, Vulture, stand by.</i>

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:30.139
<i>We're picking up three contacts</i>

00:15:30.163 --> 00:15:31.496
approaching our PIM.

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:34.165
Pegasus, report, over!

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:35.834
<i>Vulture, incoming torpedoes!</i>

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:38.837
<i>We took a hit!</i>

00:15:38.906 --> 00:15:40.505
Marine FOB Haiti,

00:15:40.574 --> 00:15:42.641
this is Vulture
requesting emergency extract

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.243
from our location.

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:46.311
Send the Helo.

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:55.254
Ahh!

00:15:55.322 --> 00:15:57.055
Burk!

00:15:57.124 --> 00:15:57.923
Shit!

00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:59.258
Burk's hit!
Hang on, buddy.

00:15:59.326 --> 00:16:00.725
I got you, I got you, it's okay.

00:16:00.794 --> 00:16:02.728
Okay, hold on.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.403
Ugh, is it bad?

00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:12.805
No, man. It ain't bad,

00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:14.851
it ain't bad at all.
All right, you're gonna be fine.

00:16:14.875 --> 00:16:16.809
I can feel something,
I think it's metal.

00:16:16.877 --> 00:16:18.677
It's the slug,
you gotta dig it out.

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:22.014
Green.

00:16:23.083 --> 00:16:24.282
This isn't gonna feel good.

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:25.417
You're gonna be fine.

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:26.819
But it's time to cowboy up.

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:28.953
Now, Miller.
Use your finger.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:31.890
I'm sorry, man.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.828
Got two slugs here,
then again in the stomach.

00:16:35.896 --> 00:16:37.629
Fourth one, stuck in my thigh.

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.365
Yeah, I've, uh...

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:43.035
I've had a few close calls.

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:46.505
I took one in the Kevlar,
knock wood.

00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:47.906
It's nothing too serious.

00:16:47.974 --> 00:16:50.175
This bastard came over
to read me last rites,

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:52.511
and he got one in the spine.

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:55.047
I guess you didn't want me
going to heaven alone.

00:16:55.115 --> 00:16:57.516
I was afraid you might get lost.

00:16:57.584 --> 00:16:59.385
Might have.

00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:23.876
Go ahead, touch it.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.288
Can you feel that?

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:37.556
Yeah.

00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:40.492
Of course I can.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.828
Come here, let me tell you
a little secret.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.767
I'm a superhero.

00:17:48.835 --> 00:17:50.102
Whoa.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.904
Shh.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:08.253
War has a flavor the protected
will never taste.

00:18:08.322 --> 00:18:09.454
Hmm.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.256
They look at the Purple Hearts,

00:18:11.258 --> 00:18:13.191
and they talk about valor.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.261
They don't want to hear
about the guilt, the nightmares,

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:19.331
or the 30 years of headaches
that come with it.

00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.734
Yeah, my dad fought in Vietnam,
did three tours.

00:18:22.803 --> 00:18:24.002
6th Marines...

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.071
Con Thien, Mekong, Cambodia.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.606
Man, I used to...

00:18:27.674 --> 00:18:29.674
hear him up
at all hours of the night,

00:18:29.743 --> 00:18:33.612
just pacing the house,
pacing the house.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.148
Whenever I asked him about it,
you know, he'd...

00:18:36.216 --> 00:18:37.816
never say nothing.

00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:39.417
Now you know why.

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:42.487
Your old man kept his mouth shut
because he knew.

00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.823
You weren't there
and you couldn't understand.

00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:52.965
Amen to that.

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:50.622
She's pretty.

00:19:53.093 --> 00:19:55.293
Yeah, she was.

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.073
It must have been hard for you
out there, all alone,

00:19:57.097 --> 00:20:00.432
not knowing what was going on
back here.

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:04.903
I can't imagine it was
any tougher than it was for you.

00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:07.039
It was quick for some.

00:20:07.107 --> 00:20:09.307
My dad survived the longest.

00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:11.176
After my brothers died,
he just hung on,

00:20:11.178 --> 00:20:14.913
sleeping in the guest house.

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.314
Hardest part wasn't losing him,

00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:17.982
it was watching him
get sicker and sicker

00:20:17.984 --> 00:20:21.119
and not being able to go to him.

00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:22.921
We used, uh

00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:25.057
Signs made
from old cardboard boxes

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:27.259
to talk to each other.

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:33.198
One morning, I...

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.200
went outside,
and there he was on the porch,

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:37.069
just standing there.

00:20:39.005 --> 00:20:42.074
Virus took his mind and...

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:43.608
he was suffering so much,

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:47.212
so my mom...

00:20:47.214 --> 00:20:49.548
took out the shotgun and...

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:57.556
And then you got sick.

00:21:03.564 --> 00:21:06.465
But then you came back
with the cure, just in time.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.903
Anyway, I didn't...

00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:12.170
mean to take up all your day

00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:15.107
with my Gothic stories
of the plague.

00:21:15.175 --> 00:21:18.376
But you should know,

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.446
I understand your pain.

00:21:21.515 --> 00:21:25.317
And even if you're thinking
you're all alone...

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.052
you're not.

00:21:34.395 --> 00:21:35.728
It's probably time for dessert.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:39.932
Okay.

00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:51.077
See that?

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:54.146
Told you you'd make it.

00:21:54.214 --> 00:21:56.548
I'm gonna call him Rhubarb.

00:21:56.617 --> 00:21:59.884
Miller,
keep that rodent away from me.

00:21:59.886 --> 00:22:01.620
Gunfire's getting closer.

00:22:01.688 --> 00:22:04.689
They must have broken through
the line in Grand Bahia.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:07.425
Gustavo's army will be
all over us in no time.

00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:09.561
Helos left Haiti at 0330.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.296
We should be
hearing from them soon.

00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:15.834
I was gonna wait
till we were on the flight home,

00:22:15.902 --> 00:22:17.480
but it looks like
we got a couple minutes,

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:19.437
so let's take some time.

00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:22.374
You're the architect
of Gustavo's war machine.

00:22:22.442 --> 00:22:25.043
What's the sequel to Plan Azul?

00:22:25.111 --> 00:22:27.712
Haiti, Puerto Rico, Bahamas?

00:22:27.714 --> 00:22:30.315
I fight
for the Latin American people.

00:22:30.384 --> 00:22:32.384
So that we will no longer
be dependent

00:22:32.453 --> 00:22:33.718
on the whims of the north.

00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:35.520
Now you sound like your boss.

00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:37.389
You're a man of war, Admiral.

00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:39.391
And a professor,
as I understand.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.193
You tell me...

00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.928
how many invasions,
bombings, coups,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.798
CIA black opps,
and other interventions

00:22:45.866 --> 00:22:48.333
does it take
before people push back?

00:22:48.402 --> 00:22:49.601
America's not your enemy.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.869
America is a continent,

00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:52.604
not a country, Admiral.

00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:54.539
Learn that...

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.009
maybe you'll understand
La Revolución.

00:22:57.077 --> 00:22:59.478
Gustavo's not a revolutionary.

00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:02.414
He's not fighting
to right old wrongs.

00:23:02.483 --> 00:23:04.416
He's a strong man
and an opportunist,

00:23:04.485 --> 00:23:06.551
and he's killed more
of your people than ours.

00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.953
I did not say I support Gustavo.

00:23:17.498 --> 00:23:22.367
You're not in Jamaica
guarding Gustavo's secrets.

00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:23.902
You're running away.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.838
Yes, Admiral.

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:30.442
In another of
the great post-plague ironies,

00:23:30.511 --> 00:23:32.577
one of the great
strategists of war

00:23:32.579 --> 00:23:35.313
has become a pacifist.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.323
The first time I heard him speak

00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:47.326
was in his home town.

00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:50.595
A little place called Rubi.

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:53.332
He was a man
of humble beginnings,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.535
speaking of hope, belonging...

00:23:56.603 --> 00:23:59.671
Listening to Tavo
was a revelation.

00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:02.141
He put words to the pain
and the shame

00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:04.609
of the South American
experience...

00:24:04.678 --> 00:24:07.612
All we'd been feeling
for so long.

00:24:07.681 --> 00:24:12.017
The plans we made together
were going to do great good.

00:24:12.085 --> 00:24:14.486
So what changed?

00:24:14.555 --> 00:24:16.688
Tavo changed.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.825
Or he stopped hiding
his true intentions.

00:24:19.893 --> 00:24:21.560
And it wasn't just rebels
being killed,

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:22.694
it was whole villages...

00:24:22.763 --> 00:24:25.731
Anyone who fed
into Tavo's paranoia.

00:24:28.301 --> 00:24:30.969
You can only see a child
be burned alive so many times

00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:35.240
before you question
your part in it all.

00:24:35.308 --> 00:24:37.576
You know his next moves.

00:24:37.644 --> 00:24:40.579
Help me stop him,
help me end this.

00:24:40.647 --> 00:24:42.113
If I help you,

00:24:42.183 --> 00:24:44.115
will that save my nation?

00:24:44.117 --> 00:24:45.316
If you don't,

00:24:45.386 --> 00:24:49.254
will your nation
still be worth saving?

00:24:49.322 --> 00:24:51.322
If I join you...

00:24:51.392 --> 00:24:53.258
I'm still an instrument
of death.

00:24:53.326 --> 00:24:56.528
The only difference
is the person delivering it.

00:24:57.598 --> 00:25:00.131
<i>Vulture,
this is Scorpion 1-3, over.</i>

00:25:00.133 --> 00:25:03.268
The Marines are here!

00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:04.469
Scorpion, this is Vulture.

00:25:04.538 --> 00:25:07.272
Are you in position to extract?
Over.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.008
<i>Negative, Vulture.
Scorpion 1-2 has gone down</i>

00:25:10.077 --> 00:25:11.476
<i>over enemy territory.</i>

00:25:11.545 --> 00:25:13.545
<i>We just lost contact with 1-6.</i>

00:25:13.547 --> 00:25:15.414
<i>It's too hot.
We're returning to base.</i>

00:25:15.482 --> 00:25:17.549
Expect return at 0930.

00:25:17.618 --> 00:25:20.219
<i>Water extract three clicks
south of Alpha. Over.</i>

00:25:20.287 --> 00:25:23.022
Scorpion 1-3,
we have a high-value package

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.090
that requires immediate evac.

00:25:25.158 --> 00:25:26.558
Please advise, over.

00:25:26.627 --> 00:25:28.760
<i>Copy, Vulture.
We're dropping CRRC</i>

00:25:28.762 --> 00:25:30.762
<i>nine clicks west
of your Whiskey. Over.</i>

00:25:34.501 --> 00:25:36.635
No, Scorpion 1-3, drop location

00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:38.970
is deep behind enemy lines.
Over.

00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:41.040
<i>Roger, Vulture,
it's the best we can do.</i>

00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:42.908
<i>Scorpion 1-3 out.</i>

00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:44.375
By the sound of it,

00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:47.178
whatever I say
will not matter much anyway.

00:25:59.393 --> 00:26:01.393
We need that CRRC.

00:26:01.462 --> 00:26:03.729
Well, it's the opposite
direction of the open beach,

00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:05.464
and it's too dangerous
for us all to go,

00:26:05.532 --> 00:26:07.599
especially carrying him.

00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:09.801
I'll go. I'll get the CRRC
to the beach

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:11.670
and then come back here,
we all go together.

00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:12.739
I'll go with...

00:26:12.806 --> 00:26:15.474
No, mate.
Frankie needs his dad.

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:17.587
Come on, we're looking at an
army of heavily-armed assholes

00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:18.610
out there, and your leg...

00:26:18.612 --> 00:26:20.211
Is a little stiff is all.

00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:22.948
It just needs some working in.

00:26:23.016 --> 00:26:24.149
Good luck.

00:26:24.217 --> 00:26:25.550
Sir.

00:26:29.356 --> 00:26:31.422
Come on.

00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:32.824
Let's go.

00:26:41.034 --> 00:26:42.767
I got it.

00:26:57.985 --> 00:26:59.985
Ow!

00:27:00.053 --> 00:27:01.452
Ash, you okay?
I'm fine.

00:27:01.454 --> 00:27:03.188
It's not that bad.
Come back to the table,

00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:05.769
let's at least keep talking about this.
There's nothing left to say.

00:27:05.793 --> 00:27:08.327
Come on, guys. You can't end
this conversation like this.

00:27:08.395 --> 00:27:10.329
There's no conversation to have.

00:27:10.397 --> 00:27:11.863
Why do you have to be
such a bitch?

00:27:11.865 --> 00:27:12.597
Sam.
What!

00:27:12.666 --> 00:27:14.199
We're only home for a few...

00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:15.645
Yeah, well, at least I'm honest.
Yeah, since when?

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:16.980
I'm not the one
who told my new school

00:27:17.004 --> 00:27:18.447
my last name was Jerome!
What the hell, Ash?!

00:27:18.471 --> 00:27:20.005
Shut up!

00:27:20.073 --> 00:27:21.440
You did that, buddy?

00:27:22.743 --> 00:27:25.944
It's a lot of pressure
being Tom Chandler's kid.

00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:27.212
You knew about this?

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.391
It wasn't my place
to say anything.

00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:29.881
How am I suddenly a stranger

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:30.816
in my own home?

00:27:30.884 --> 00:27:32.551
When haven't you been
a stranger?

00:27:32.619 --> 00:27:35.420
The two of you, you're like
these war machines.

00:27:35.489 --> 00:27:38.623
Everything
is this mission for you.

00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:41.092
So you are mad about what
happened in Southcom today.

00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:42.627
You are unbelievable.

00:27:42.696 --> 00:27:43.962
I'm gonna eat in the kitchen.

00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:46.398
Sit down.

00:27:48.435 --> 00:27:51.170
I came home from work
to see you.

00:27:51.238 --> 00:27:53.839
I just want one peaceful dinner.

00:27:56.377 --> 00:27:58.177
I'm trying to be here for you.

00:27:58.245 --> 00:28:00.179
And it shows.

00:28:00.247 --> 00:28:02.181
You shouldn't have to try, Dad.

00:28:02.249 --> 00:28:03.292
When you're here,
you're miserable,

00:28:03.316 --> 00:28:04.783
and everyone knows it.

00:28:09.256 --> 00:28:10.589
I need a bandage.

00:28:10.657 --> 00:28:13.324
Here, let me.
I got it.

00:28:25.338 --> 00:28:27.338
How's the neck?

00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:28.740
Eh...

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:30.520
Looks like you earned yourself
another medal.

00:28:30.544 --> 00:28:33.412
Yeah.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.947
For valor.

00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:39.284
Miller and Wolf
should be back by now.

00:28:39.352 --> 00:28:40.752
We're running out of time.

00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:42.821
If the sun comes up,
game's over.

00:28:46.093 --> 00:28:47.559
Asco.

00:28:47.628 --> 00:28:49.961
Mm. Never liked rum.

00:28:52.365 --> 00:28:53.364
We're gonna have to move soon.

00:28:53.366 --> 00:28:54.766
How do you feel?

00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:56.301
Sick.

00:28:56.369 --> 00:28:57.903
Sick of war.

00:28:57.971 --> 00:29:00.239
Sometimes war is the only way
to keep the peace.

00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:03.242
You heard my lecture?

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.044
We used to share that theory.

00:29:05.112 --> 00:29:07.713
I'm not so sure of it anymore.

00:29:07.781 --> 00:29:10.849
Sometimes I think peace

00:29:10.918 --> 00:29:14.453
is the awkward pause
between wars.

00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:17.122
Maybe peace is the time

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.191
for the world
to reload its weapons.

00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:22.527
And you...

00:29:22.596 --> 00:29:25.196
you look different
than the first time we met.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.667
Older.

00:29:28.735 --> 00:29:29.601
No.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.137
That is not it.

00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:34.940
You are haunted.

00:29:35.008 --> 00:29:36.741
Or maybe hunted.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:40.045
This is what war
has done to you.

00:29:46.287 --> 00:29:49.488
Doctor, this isn't about me.

00:29:49.556 --> 00:29:52.491
My country's not perfect,
I am not perfect.

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:55.760
I can't promise you
there'll be no more killing.

00:29:55.829 --> 00:29:57.829
But if you'll agree to help me,

00:29:57.898 --> 00:29:59.865
maybe we can find a real peace.

00:30:02.169 --> 00:30:05.504
Now I understand why Gustavo
hates you so much.

00:30:07.174 --> 00:30:09.441
Promise me...

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:13.512
soldier to soldier...

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.714
end this quickly.

00:30:18.385 --> 00:30:21.386
Whatever is hunting you...

00:30:21.455 --> 00:30:23.454
I pray it never finds you.

00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:26.659
Coming in!

00:30:30.931 --> 00:30:32.597
Good news!
We have an extract.

00:30:32.666 --> 00:30:34.333
And the bad?

00:30:34.401 --> 00:30:36.067
Expect company.

00:30:45.079 --> 00:30:46.623
CRRC's on the beach
about a mile from here.

00:30:46.647 --> 00:30:48.113
That's a long way
to carry him, sir.

00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:49.514
We gotta try.

00:30:50.917 --> 00:30:52.250
Too late!
They're here.

00:30:52.319 --> 00:30:53.251
Wolf, Green, on the door.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.053
Miller, with Burk.

00:30:59.726 --> 00:31:01.460
Come here, buddy.
It's okay.

00:31:03.597 --> 00:31:05.330
There you go.

00:31:15.942 --> 00:31:18.343
I'm gone, she's mad.
I'm here, she's mad.

00:31:18.345 --> 00:31:20.012
I don't know
how to make her happy.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.481
You just need to be
a little more patient with her.

00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:23.816
She just wants a normal life.

00:31:23.884 --> 00:31:25.150
Who doesn't?

00:31:25.219 --> 00:31:27.752
I just feel like all I do
is make things worse.

00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:29.688
Ash.

00:31:29.756 --> 00:31:31.890
Ashley, come back here.

00:31:50.377 --> 00:31:51.576
Rhubarb!

00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:56.849
Jesus, Ash, what is you want?!

00:31:56.917 --> 00:31:59.317
I'm doing the b...
Turn around and talk to me!

00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:02.121
Move it!

00:32:10.397 --> 00:32:11.664
You're not listening to me!

00:32:11.732 --> 00:32:12.665
What are you doing?

00:32:12.733 --> 00:32:14.132
You are not listening!

00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:15.934
Not listening!
Was that necessary?

00:32:16.002 --> 00:32:17.802
No, you're not, Dad.

00:32:17.872 --> 00:32:20.138
What are you telling me?

00:32:36.557 --> 00:32:38.397
I just don't know what it is
you're telling me.

00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:39.558
What are you telling me?

00:33:40.287 --> 00:33:41.686
Get back here,
I'm talking to you!

00:33:49.363 --> 00:33:51.229
Come back here,
I'm talking to you.

00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:58.503
Grenade!

00:34:26.266 --> 00:34:27.599
Mom knew it, too!

00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:30.068
She knew you hated being home.

00:34:30.136 --> 00:34:32.671
You were never happy unless
you were on your damn ship!

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:35.340
I'm sorry I'm the one
you got stuck with.

00:34:35.342 --> 00:34:37.275
I'm sorry your mom died!

00:34:37.344 --> 00:34:39.411
And you weren't here.

00:34:48.689 --> 00:34:51.089
Montano's dead.
We gotta move.

00:34:51.158 --> 00:34:52.491
On me.

00:35:17.584 --> 00:35:19.218
Ashley.

00:35:21.188 --> 00:35:22.521
Ashley.

00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:31.396
You don't belong here.

00:35:34.935 --> 00:35:37.069
You belong out there.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.749
Five years of plague,
famine, and war

00:35:50.817 --> 00:35:52.484
have brought
this country together

00:35:52.553 --> 00:35:56.288
in a way not seen
since the second World War.

00:35:56.356 --> 00:35:58.823
In a population laid low,

00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:02.627
tens of thousands
have volunteered their time,

00:36:02.629 --> 00:36:04.897
their passion, their lives...

00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:28.587
Looks like Cuba's not
as hopeless as we thought.

00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:30.989
According to Dr. Montano,
there's a rebellion forming

00:36:31.057 --> 00:36:32.791
under a man
who goes by El Gallo.

00:36:32.859 --> 00:36:34.593
That name mean
anything to anyone?

00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:37.529
We had heard rumors
about an anti-Gustavo movement

00:36:37.598 --> 00:36:39.531
in Cuba, but nothing confirmed.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.065
Probably intentional.

00:36:41.067 --> 00:36:43.268
El Gallo wouldn't want Gustavo
to see him coming.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.337
But Montano knew about him.

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:47.072
You think he kept that
from his boss?

00:36:47.141 --> 00:36:48.406
I do.

00:36:48.475 --> 00:36:51.944
Montano preferred
stalemate over slaughter.

00:36:52.012 --> 00:36:54.346
Well, even if this intel
is correct,

00:36:54.414 --> 00:36:56.348
El Gallo and his men
are still vastly outnumbered

00:36:56.417 --> 00:36:58.283
by Gustavo's forces in Cuba.

00:36:58.285 --> 00:36:59.884
Not if they have backup.

00:36:59.954 --> 00:37:01.932
If we work with the rebels,
take control of the island,

00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:03.888
we can us it
as a staging ground.

00:37:03.958 --> 00:37:05.824
Install troops, planes, ships.

00:37:05.892 --> 00:37:08.893
From there, Panama and Colombia
are within striking distance.

00:37:08.963 --> 00:37:12.230
We take Cuba...

00:37:12.299 --> 00:37:14.433
we can win this war.

00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:17.636
Dr. Montano just gave us
the key.

00:37:26.246 --> 00:37:29.448
This is Daddy's tool.

00:37:29.516 --> 00:37:30.983
Very sharp.

00:37:31.051 --> 00:37:34.987
But it can be used
to make really cool stuff.

00:37:35.055 --> 00:37:37.055
Like this.

00:37:37.123 --> 00:37:39.458
See?

00:37:39.526 --> 00:37:41.593
When you get older...

00:37:41.662 --> 00:37:43.796
you can have a knife, too.

00:37:43.864 --> 00:37:44.797
Okay?

00:37:44.865 --> 00:37:46.365
Wow.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.937
Pew! Pew! Pew!

00:37:53.007 --> 00:37:57.141
I'm getting the bad guys, Daddy.

00:37:57.143 --> 00:37:58.877
You sure are, pal.

00:38:14.495 --> 00:38:16.961
Hi, there.

00:38:17.031 --> 00:38:19.832
Hi, yourself.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.301
Got any more of that sweet tea?

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:25.303
I think I might.

00:38:31.712 --> 00:38:33.578
So we'll come visit
for the fourth.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.447
That'd be cool. There's
a huge fireworks show

00:38:35.516 --> 00:38:36.448
up in Forest Park.

00:38:36.517 --> 00:38:38.851
Oh, that's awesome.

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:40.252
Packed your summer clothes?

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.986
Yeah.
Rain gear?

00:38:42.056 --> 00:38:44.589
Spring in St. Louis
is always wet.

00:38:44.658 --> 00:38:45.924
Got that, too, Dad.

00:38:45.992 --> 00:38:47.192
All right.

00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:48.793
Call me if you need anything.

00:38:56.136 --> 00:38:57.602
I love you, Dad.

00:38:57.604 --> 00:38:59.938
I love you, too, baby.

00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:18.423
Ash?

00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:20.059
Stay safe.

00:39:22.429 --> 00:39:24.563
I want you to stay safe, too,
Dad.

00:39:26.767 --> 00:39:30.302
But more than that...

00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:32.971
I want you to find peace.

00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:00.398
Wait, wait, wait.
This freakin' mouse!

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:01.333
A mouse?!

00:40:01.402 --> 00:40:02.667
I never saw anything like it.

00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:05.069
Miller was in love!

00:40:07.474 --> 00:40:08.851
You didn't see
this little guy, sir.

00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:11.209
Okay, he... he was so perfect
and innocent.

00:40:11.278 --> 00:40:13.278
Uh-huh.

00:40:13.347 --> 00:40:15.258
- Was he your little buddy?
- Beauty and the beast.

00:40:15.282 --> 00:40:16.148
Oh, come on!

00:40:16.216 --> 00:40:17.616
I think I'm gonna cry.

00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:21.820
Hey, there he is!

00:40:21.888 --> 00:40:23.488
Hail the conquering hero.

00:40:23.557 --> 00:40:25.089
Don't let me interrupt.
Grab a cold one,

00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:26.759
we got, what, grape soda and...

00:40:26.827 --> 00:40:28.160
What is that, cherry cola?

00:40:28.228 --> 00:40:30.095
- Cherry.
- Cherry cola.

00:40:30.164 --> 00:40:31.964
Don't mind if I do.

00:40:32.032 --> 00:40:33.876
So, finish the story,
what happened to the mouse?

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.435
Okay, so Rhubarb escapes
out of the cage

00:40:36.503 --> 00:40:38.503
right when we get
under fire, okay?

00:40:38.505 --> 00:40:40.572
Bullets are flying around me,
and there he goes.

00:40:40.641 --> 00:40:43.108
Rhubarb?
Rhubarb?

00:40:43.177 --> 00:40:45.221
That's what I'm telling you.
What, hey, that's his name.

00:40:45.245 --> 00:40:48.313
Stupid. I'm telling you,
that little varmint,

00:40:48.315 --> 00:40:49.982
he made it out of there.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.183
He's a survivor.

00:40:51.251 --> 00:40:51.984
To Rhubarb.

00:40:52.052 --> 00:40:53.185
To Rhubarb. To Rhubarb.

00:40:53.253 --> 00:40:55.053
To Rhubarb.
