WEBVTT

00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:01.736
<i>Previously on The Last Ship.</i>

00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:03.936
The U.S. was the victim
of a cyberattack.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:05.559
I need you to find the virus,
where it came from,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.857
and how to get rid of it.

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.760
<i>I have asked the Congress
to declare a State of War</i>

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:10.997
The President may have declared war,

00:00:10.998 --> 00:00:12.936
but right now we don't have
a military to fight it.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.630
Not true.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.770
We have <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.160
- Brace!
- Incoming!

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.082
If Gustavo gets his troops
across that bridge,

00:00:19.107 --> 00:00:20.522
it's game over.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.956
Then let's blow up that bridge.

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:23.838
Gustavo doesn't know we're alive.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.920
We resupply,
and we take the fight to him.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.821
We read you loud and clear.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:28.825
Let's go hunting.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.080
And when were you
going to tell me about

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.419
the rebel attack in Panama?

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.750
It was nothing.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.220
We took care of it.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.690
Do you know what makes the
Americans different from us?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.560
Hope.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.839
The Americans think
they're special, blessed.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.569
Doesn't matter
what tragedy hits them,

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.639
they always believe things
will get better.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.240
That hope makes them
hard to beat.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.849
We can't let them have hope.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.180
And we can't let
our people have doubt.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.809
Not much more we can
do about Gustavo's movement

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.409
in Central America.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.949
Our best use of time
and resources is Mexico...

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.279
Make a stand there,
send a message

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.949
to the rest of the region,
make them think twice

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.219
about whose side they're on.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.489
Gustavo's got to know about the
oil complex at Costa Hirviendo.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.620
General, what kind of assets
could you move into that area?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.699
I have a brigade of 800 soldiers
in Corpus Christi, Texas.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.560
But it'll take a few days to organize
and supply them to cross the border.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.899
Meantime, we'll need
a convincing show of sea power.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.699
Oil complex is on the coast.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.909
Place<i> Nathan James</i> there,
hold the line

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.770
until the cavalry arrives.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.319
Two viruses.
Huh.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.589
Due respect to you both,
the Yucatán Strait

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.589
can't be held by one ship...
Even<i> Nathan James.</i>

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.990
We're gonna need a reliable
partner in the Mexicans.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.199
More than just the Mexicans.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.129
We need help from both sides
of the strait.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.399
You're talking about Cuba.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.730
Mexico and Cuba are at war.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.199
Have been since the famine.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
Both sides accuse
the other of invasions

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.539
and murdering civilians.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.139
So much bad blood between them.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.609
You just need
to make them understand

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.140
one simple fact.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.079
Alone, neither country
will last a week

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.079
when Gustavo comes at them.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.219
There's no secure channel

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.749
to the Mexican
or Cuban governments.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.950
But we can talk to Slattery,
and he can reach out

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.350
locally over HF.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.359
Have them come to a parley
aboard the<i> James.</i>

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.089
I think very highly of Slattery,
but do you think he can...

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.490
I'm gonna do it myself.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.629
Admiral, do you have any idea
what kind of morale disaster

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.160
it would be if you got
hurt down there?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.769
How much of a morale disaster
would it be

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.699
if we got invaded
in a few weeks?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.970
You got to find a way to get me
back on<i> Nathan James.</i>

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.030

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.110
Any word from the U.S.?
There's still no satellite link.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.279
How much Semtex?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.009
Oh, looks like about 12 kilos...

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.479
Barely enough to take down a bridge.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.749
Let's hope they built it
quick and sloppy.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.949
I don't know how much longer
I can depend on these men.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.550
I got to get them
a victory soon.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.020
Pablo thought we could do it.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.759
Yeah, that was before we lost
half our men and gear.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.029
The bridge is the thing...
We take that out,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.560
we stop Gustavo's march north,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.830
and we show your people
he can be beaten.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.569
It's our only option.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.969
Okay.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.210
We camp here tonight,
head out at dawn.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.189
Page 101, paragraph 4,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.120
line 2, word 14.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.129
Radar's up and running,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.599
and the five-inch now
has full range of motion.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.739
That's good.
I suspect we'll need it.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.739
Captain, we have an unidentified
low, slow flier approaching.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.310
Bearing 2-0-5, range... 6 miles.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.810
Airship approaching,
identify yourself

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.889
and prepare to alter course
on my command, over.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.489
Happy to alter course
on your command, Captain,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.819
but we're requesting permission
to land in a minute,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.960
so don't send us too far off.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.629
Permission granted.
Right on time.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.239
<i>Nathan James,</i> this is Brawler.
Much appreciated.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.039
Admiral, you mind
leaning back a little?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.170
Won't be a second.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.979
Forward bearing's
a little wonky.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.640
We're good.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.779
Do you need to throttle down?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.319
Nah.
She'll be fine.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.519
These old Hueys,
you can't kill 'em.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.119
Hell, Slider and I
have run her on everything

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.850
from bonded bourbon
to salad oil.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.789
She still spins like a top.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.329
Can you believe this thing
sat out in a field

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.190
in Pensacola for 15 years?

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.560
You don't say.
Hang on.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.889
Mike.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:54.419
How was your flight?
You have no idea.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.820
Maddie Rawlings.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.359
Lieutenant, Junior Grade.
Call sign Brawler.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.029
This is my co-pilot, Slider,
and that's Stinger.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.229
Pleased to meet you, sir.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.769
Well, welcome aboard.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.630
Your analog Huey's
about the only thing in the Navy

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.439
that didn't get hit
by the virus,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.239
so she's a fighter.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.639
You're hungry,
they're still serving dinner

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.709
on the mess decks.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.710
Thank you, sir.
Chow time!

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.649
Sir. Still trying to find a
place to store everything, sir.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.420
Uh-huh.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.059
Reps from Mexico and Cuba
are boarding.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.529
Excellent.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.590
I hear they absolutely
hate each other.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.599
Any ideas?
One or two.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.469
Think they'll work?
I think they have to.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.869
Both arrived on patrol craft.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.600
Two ships armed to the teeth
from two countries at war.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.409
With us in between.
What could go wrong?

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.870
Thank you.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.939
Sirs.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.340
What a pleasure it is
to meet you both.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.879
I've heard so much abo...

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.949
You invited Cuba?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.149
Mexico.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.819
What is this?

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.959
It's called "diplomacy,"
and it starts now.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.390
This way.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.170
Okay.
There we go.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.010
Hey.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.949
Hey, I brought fresh clothes,
khakis, toothbrush...

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.749
Whatever I could find.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.689
How you doing?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.289
This place...

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.089
They took your computer,
wouldn't let me in.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.089
Yeah, it's a security thing.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.159
I'm sorry.
I can't let you back there.

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.629
Have you heard from anybody?
Kara?

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.899
Your friends from<i> Nathan James?</i>
It's been so chaotic.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.239
I think everyone's
just trying to catch their breath.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.769
But thank you so much
for doing this.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.439
How long before
you can come back home?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.440
It's too soon to tell.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.779
I got to get back to work.
But I just got here.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.310
I know. Why don't you
call your sister?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.979
No.
You shouldn't be home alone.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.220
No!

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.189
I'm sorry.
Jesus.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.589
Look at me,
the damsel in distress.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.129
I don't want to make things
harder for you.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.999
Look at me.
Hey.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.069
We got hit hard, but we have
a plan and a way to win.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.599
Yeah?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.739
We've still got some tricks
up our sleeve.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.870
You're safe at home,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.740
and if anything changes,
I will call you first.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.340
You better.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.410
I'll have security
walk you to your car.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.169
The bridge is built, and
they are already moving forward.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.969
Looks like they're
setting up camp.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.500
We don't have much time.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.439
This is just the advance team.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.239
Soon, there'll be tens
of thousands...

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.839
Jeeps, tanks, soldiers.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.449
If they get across to the Panama
side of the bridge,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.480
we won't be able to stop them.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.049
When you're invaded,
you defend yourself!

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.719
"Invaded"?
You coward.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.519
There was no Cuban government,
so how could there be an army?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.789
These were hungry,
terrified families

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.129
arriving on your shores
in broken-down rafts and boats!

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.460
And what do they do then?
They murdered Cuban refugees.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.330
And then they turned around
and invaded us.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.669
Gentlemen.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.209
The plague is over.
So is the famine.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.139
We're here to talk about how to
defend you both from Gustavo's army.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.609
He's coming north, sinking your
shipping as we speak.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.349
U.S. is offering an alliance,
boots on the ground.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.619
An occupying force...
A<i> protecting</i> force.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.489
Gustavo's movement
races up from Panama.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.759
Soon, it'll be at your borders.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.490
A real invasion. Sounds
like Mexico's problem.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.299
I cannot work with this...
This war criminal!

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.699
Look.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.099
At this point,
neither of you has much choice.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.639
Señor Aguilar,
your hold on Southern Mexico

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.969
is already faltering.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.970
They want independence.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.040
Gustavo's promised them that.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.979
And Señor Fuentes,
how much oil and natural gas

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.319
does Cuba have in reserve
to fight a wider war?

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.950
I can answer that.
None.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.720
You two have your differences.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.320
Once victory is achieved,
we'll let

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.399
our civilian leadership figure
out the right thing to do.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.929
But for now,
we have a single agenda...

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.869
Unite and fight
or let Gustavo march north.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.200
It's that simple.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.209
Excuse me, sir.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.240
You need to see this.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.620
Costa Rica has fallen.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.449
Things have changed.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.780
I need to think.
I need to talk to my people.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:43.999
We have a problem.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.140
Look at the size of
the bridge supports.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680
Damn.

00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:56.809
We don't have enough Semtex.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.009
Not even close.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.479
But it's enough to blow
a hole in the bridge's deck,

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.480
make it unusable.
With what we've got,

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.350
any hole we make, they could
repair it in a few hours.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.020
We need a new plan.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.630
Danny.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.730
Perez.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.639
He's the target now.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.970
We're gonna use him
to draw away those guards...

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.049
gives you two a chance
to take that fuel truck.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.310
Attach your Semtex to it.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.519
Drive it onto the bridge.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.590
And turn the whole thing
into a fuel-oil bomb.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.130
<i>Bueno.</i>

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.939
Armando, we need two
of your best men.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.009
We'll meet up with the rest
when the time is right.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.409
You have us. You two get
as close as you can.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.749
Do not make your move until
you see that it's clear.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.450
<i>Vamonos.
Sí, comandante.</i>

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.820
Let's do this.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.770
- Hey!
- Come here!

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.239
Hey, chill out!
Hey!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.440
Come here!

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:37.249
Master at Arms?
Send me three...

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.350
- Hey, hey!
- Come here!

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.650
Make that six men.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.389
- Stay back!
- Hey!

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.590
Sit down!

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.190
Disgrace to the uniform!

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.199
Check that.
We got it covered.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.660
Hey, you, come here.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.630
Outside! Move!

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.200
Now, you listen to me.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.209
You and your men are gonna
cut this shit out,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.539
you're gonna bury the hatchet.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.409
You're gonna make a deal,
or I promise you,

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.809
you will be swimming home.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.680
Escort them to the wardroom.
Move!

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.819
Ma'am.
I've got something.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.749
Uh, the body of code that hit us
here in the command center,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.950
I think I've cracked it.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.419
I've isolated the first part...

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.829
It's a set of servo motor
instructions...

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.760
to a machine of some kind.
A machine in our building?

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.300
United States on deck!

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.640
I know dictators,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.649
and I've dealt with my share.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.049
There's one thing
they all have in common...

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.519
Whatever they have,
it's never enough.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.850
Gustavo won't stop
at Costa Rica.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.589
I just need you both to help me,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.459
and each other, for a few days

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.529
to close the strait
to whoever's coming north.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.060
I need mines, and I need ships
to lay them.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.999
We use them to force the enemy
to a location of our choosing.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.300
<i>Nathan James</i>
will handle the rest.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.670
Maybe someday,
we'll see the end of war.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.479
But for now, once again,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.749
we have to fight together.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.280
I'm gonna leave the room.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.349
You two are gonna settle
your differences.

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.419
But do it fast.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.959
If there's a fleet
headed this way,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.289
I intend to stop it.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.730
Don't go.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.770
I understand.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.109
If you're willing, honestly,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.040
to stand by this man...

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.649
I will do the same.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.589
And we can work out our dispute
after the fight is over.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.520
What do you say?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.059
Tom Chandler...
The man is Washington,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:12.599
FDR, Eisenhower, with a touch
of Lincoln rolled into one,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.539
and you have sent him
onto the front lines,

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.670
into a battle space
we cannot see,

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.940
without my authorization.

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.880
Toy ships and paper maps.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.689
It's like we're back
fighting World War II.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.159
Is it true that you're using
a 19th-century novel

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.229
as some kind of codebook?

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.800
Yes sir, "Moby-Dick."

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.829
I hated that book.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.630
It is a bit of a slog, sir.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.239
What is it, Master Chief?

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.709
Sir, excuse me. We just heard
from<i> Nathan James.</i>

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.709
Admiral Chandler's managed
to bring Mexico and Cuba

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.840
together to blockade
the Yucatán Strait.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.040
Terrific.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.710
And I imagine
we'll coordinate the mission

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.620
through a careful reading
of "War and Peace."

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.789
Sir, it's...

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:11.129
It's possible
that my personal feelings

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.729
at the loss of our fleet
have clouded my judgment.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.729
If you don't have
full confidence in me,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.330
I'm prepared to tender
my resignation

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.869
right here and right now.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.939
The attack happened on my watch.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.009
Sir, the responsibility
should not lie solely

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.879
on the admiral's shoulders.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.079
We all supported his decision.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.149
I bear as much responsibility
as he does.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.419
As I do, sir. No, none of you
are gonna get off that easy.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.689
Sit!

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.959
Make no mistake, I don't mind
replacing every damn one of you.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.889
But I want you to finish
what you started

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.899
and prove to me that I have
the right team in place.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.760
Move your army into Mexico,

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.630
and proceed
with the naval blockade.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.039
Now, let's save
that goddamned oil complex

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.309
and stop Gustavo in his tracks.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.580
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.980
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.790
Remember me?

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.999
From here to here,
and here to here.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.939
Cuba, you're gonna handle
in the east.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.139
Mexico, the west.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.209
We only have another patrol boat
in the region.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.079
I can have him here in 12 hours.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.679
Whatever Mexico has,
it's also at your disposal.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.419
With your permission,
I need to use your radio room.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.019
This way I can authorize my men
to begin laying mines.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.819
Of course.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.960
This way.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.830
Watch him.
Oh, I will.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.440
Hey, hey.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.309
You won't get far.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.309
We'll have checkpoints
every few miles.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.379
They won't bother us
with the Colonel up front.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.049
And we'll only need
to move a few miles.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.849
Put the shirt on.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:59.319
Your companion
still looks angry.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.989
That surprises you?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.389
You killed my friend.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.459
Your friend...

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.860
Pablo!

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.270
I've killed a thousand Pablos.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.870
What's another?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.079
Call your second in command.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.279
Tell him to stop the convoy
crossing the bridge.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.149
Everyone stays
on the south side.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.280
Move your sentries
north of the bridge.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.750
I will do no such thing.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.489
Even if I did, such an order
would be ridiculous.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.689
No one would obey it.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:37.829
Tell them you've located
a rebel encampment

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.959
10 kilometers north.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.899
Tell them to move now.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.370
I don't feel like doing that.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.769
Aah!

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.040
Feel like it now?

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.980
Start talking, Lefty.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.500
<i>Sí, Colonel.</i>

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.670
Your march Al Norte ends today,
Colonel.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.479
Tell me, Admiral,
what am I doing today?

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.219
Am I making an ally,
a new partner in peace?

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.089
Or am I choosing one tyrant
over another?

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:45.429
In many ways,
Cuba is a brand-new nation,

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.229
a new democratic government,
a new life for our people.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.769
We thought we were saved.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:57.839
And this is the welcome we get
into the brotherhood of nations.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.379
War.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.839
Theft.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.379
Murder.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:07.379
When this is over,

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:12.690
I'll be there for you
and for Cuba if you need me.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.020
Armed.
Armed.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.230
Hola.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.660
Okay.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.539
Danny!

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.480
I see him.

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.129
Ma'am, by my calculations,
in 24 hours,

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.090
we'll have sufficient closure
east and west of us.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.290
Sir?
Everything okay?

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.569
XO, I'm getting traffic
from Mexican coast watchers

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.639
just southwest of us.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.370
They're picking up
enemy aircraft.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.709
Heading north?
Yes, sir.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.179
It's coming right at us.
Set General Quarters!

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.449
All ahead flank! Aye, Ma'am.
All ahead flank.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.180
Set General
Quarters and man battle stations!

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.049
All crew served weapons,
engage on my order.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.259
TAO, ready the five-inch
and standby to fire.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.789
Forward on the starboard side.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.120
Down and aft on the port side.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:17.529
I give you my word.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:21.059
Mexico did not betray
your position.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.129
Let our men fight.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.870
Let our men fight beside you.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.140
Bring all contacts to my screen!
Fire control radar, activate!

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:37.279
Sonar, go quiet now.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.419
Aye.
Securing all active sonar.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.020
Now on passive.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.039
Three planes turning back
for another run.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.170
One peeling off.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.240
Hard right rudder!

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.120
They just hit our gun boat.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.799
Come on.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.130
Come on, come on.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.399
There's got to be a kill switch
here somewhere.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.069
We're gonna have to hot-wire it.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.610
Brace!
Shift your rudder!

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.219
It's no good.
They're staying in our cut outs.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.890
Five inch won't bear.
Get the helo in the air.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.159
We got this!
Go get Perez!

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.030
Go! Go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.989
Come on.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.789
Hurrying would be good now.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:30.060
They are heading this way.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.040
All right.
Let's go.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.439
Come on, baby.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.370
Let's get behind the ship.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.509
Arm missiles.
Arming now.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.310
Stinger, they're coming back.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.980
We got one.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.460
Fire missiles!

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:42.260
Whoo!

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.040
Got 'em.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.279
7-10 split.
Nice shooting, ladies.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.050
Thanks, boss.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.219
Damn it!
Brawler, you alright?

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:02.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.560
Jump when I say, "Jump"!

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:17.670
I'll jump when you jump!

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.800
Jump!

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.410
Now!

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.820
It's encrypted.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.220
I'm taking it.

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.289
Maybe someone up north
could use it.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.290
Give me long-range HF radio.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.899
I've got a message for Gustavo.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.130
I want the world to hear it.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.440
You're live, sir.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.579
This is<i> Nathan James,</i>
calling Gustavo Barros.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.979
We just took out your airwing,

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.849
and you didn't
lay a glove on us.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:48.849
<i>And you can mark that up
along with your Corvette.</i>

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.119
<i>Payback for Mayport.</i>

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.319
<i>You may have hit us hard,
but you didn't finish us.</i>

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.859
<i>You know why?</i>

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.790
Because you can't.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.660
And now Mexico and Cuba
have joined the fight.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:06.669
So this message goes out to all
of Central and South America.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.870
<i>There is a choice now.
Join us.</i>

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.270
<i>Send Gustavo back into</i>

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.079
<i>the dirt hole he crawled out of.</i>

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.410
<i>We fight for peace.</i>

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.349
<i>But make no mistake...
We will fight.</i>

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:25.089
<i>And this ship and this crew?</i>

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.089
<i>They're damn good at it.</i>

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:31.159
<i>So, Gustavo...</i>

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:32.959
<i>come at us again.</i>

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:38.299
I dare you.
This is<i> Nathan James.</i> Out.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.639
Now, they know who we are,
where we are.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.970
Let's be ready for what
they throw at us.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:47.810
Aye, sir.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.249
Nobody's talking about
going home now.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.150
It's a good day.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.000
Oh, thank you.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.809
Good Evening,
Mr. President.

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.270
Master Chief.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.940
Today was a good day.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:23.810
Or a lucky one.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.380
Have a seat.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.089
I get it.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.890
The world needs Tom Chandler.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.229
And nobody respects him
more than I do.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:48.969
But rumor is he's tired,
burned out.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.639
He's been out of the fight
for what, three years?

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.440
They even tried
to run him for President.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.310
Turned it down.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.719
And now he's down there,
back in it,

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.789
and I'm allowing it.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.719
Putting him in this position,

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.730
I could be setting
him up to fail.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.929
And if he does...

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.330
I don't think
the country could bear that.
