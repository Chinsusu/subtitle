WEBVTT

00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.420
Previously on "The Last Ship".

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.853
The Americans think
they're special.

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.002
We can't let them have hope.

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.470
You got to find a way to get me
back on <i>Nathan James.</i>

00:00:08.471 --> 00:00:10.218
Admiral Chandler's managed to bring
Mexico and Cuba together...

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.943
to blockade the Yucatán Strait.

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:13.973
We have a single agenda...

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.570
unite and fight.

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.627
Set General Quarters and
man battle stations!

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:20.295
Let's do this.

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.873
This is <i>Nathan James,</i>
calling Gustavo.

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:26.129
We just took out your airwing,
and you didn't lay a glove on us.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.627
<i>Come at us again.</i>

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.901
<i>I dare you.</i>

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.618
No!

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.679
Gustavo...

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.614
Brother.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.083
You have to trust me.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.153
Our armies may be stopped
at the Darien Gap,

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:05.423
but we have friends
in Central America.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.225
They have guns and men.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:08.793
Let me gather their armies
and...

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.262
Mm.

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.338
Captain Aguilar's ship
will cover an area

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.340
15 miles
off the coast of Mexico.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.278
Mr. Fuentes
does the same off Cuba.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.546
Land batteries
and mines on either side

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.416
will fill the gaps
and provide early warning.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.550
Should be enough
to protect the oil complex

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.086
'til the US-Mexican
calvary arrives.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.354
If Gustavo's forces try
to make it through the mines,

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.623
they sink.

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.069
They hug beach,
we blast 'em from land.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.137
And if they come straight up
the middle towards us...

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.596
We'll be ready.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.698
I only wish Cuba
could provide more support.

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:22.566
Señor Fuentes,

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.837
on behalf
of the people of Mexico,

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:29.641
we are grateful
for the risks you have taken,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.576
not just for the battle to come,

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:34.712
but for the future
of our two countries.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.498

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:13.751
The airfield
is in that direction.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.420
Pablo said the Narcos
leave for Northern Mexico

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.956
every Wednesday at 1600.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.423
If they're still up and running.

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:21.425
That leaves us eight hours
to get to the airfield

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:22.827
and convince them
to give us a lift.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.896
You will get that lift.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:28.099
Everybody loved Pablo.

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:31.369
Vasquez will guide you
from here.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.904
Sí, Jefe.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.509
You've bought the rebel movement
some time and more.

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:39.311
You gave us confidence.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.980
Take Gustavo's war plans
back to the States.

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.247
Crack his code.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:45.049
And let us win this.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.661
Gracias, amigo.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.062
We will meet again.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.263
I'm sure.

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:05.136
Morning, babe.

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.138
What are you doing up?

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:09.341
You got home three hours ago.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.542
I got to get back.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.210
I was making breakfast.

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:14.346
Can't.
We're so close.

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.280
Close to what?

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.883
Close to figuring out how we got
attacked in the first place.

00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:21.353
Sounds like you've been playing
a lot of catch up.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.421
Everyone's doing their part.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.023
Including you.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.224
Oh, yeah?

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.759
How so?

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:29.894
Just being there for me.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:33.297
Having my back
through all of this.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:35.967
It means more than you know.

00:05:36.036 --> 00:05:37.435
Yeah.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.304
That's me, making a difference.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:14.138
Fuentes and Aguilar
are aboard their ships, sir.

00:06:22.816 --> 00:06:25.549
Where the hell are you, Gustavo?

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.419
CIC, bridge.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.887
Admiral Slattery,

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.624
I can hear you pacing
from the bridge.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:35.627
I'm beginning to think
we should shift to offense, Tom.

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:37.762
We know Gustavo's fleet's
headed toward this strait.

00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:39.163
Let's charge him head-on.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:40.632
Flush him out.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.500
I'm itching, too, Mike,
but it's a solid plan.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:44.836
Just need to give it
a little more time.

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.044
T.A.O.,
we have a ping.

00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:54.312
I have 1, 2...

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.913
Admiral,
I have three signals pinging

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.381
southwest of the strait

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.250
consistent with those
of three large vessels.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.253
Son of a bitch,
took you long enough.

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:06.458
Captain Aguilar, Señor Fuentes,
this is Nathan James.

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.526
We have sonobuoy signals

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.263
at groups Kilo,
Sierra, and Echo.

00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:12.797
Captain Aguilar,

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:14.906
we have three unidentified
contacts heading our way.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:17.068
I say again,
we have three contacts.

00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:18.670
Copy that, Admiral.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.604
Mexico is prepared to engage.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:23.207
May God be with us all.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.458
Third group of sonobuoys
is pinging south southwest,

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:43.728
bearing 2-5-0. OOD,
come to course 2-7-0.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.397
OOD, aye.
Helm, come to course 2-7-0.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.133
Helm, aye,
coming to course 2-7-0.

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.867
All teams, Gustavo's fleet

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:52.003
has adjusted course
five degrees.

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.940
Aguilar,
if they maintain course...

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:58.009
all three ships
are set to split our line.

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:01.012
Copy that, Nathan James.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.880
Can you ID any of those vessels?

00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:06.083
Sir, I'm unable to identify them
off the sonobuoy markers.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:09.286
And they're still too far away for me
to analyze their signatures on radar.

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.355
Holler as soon as you do.

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.490
I want to know
what we're up against.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:13.959
Yes, sir.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:16.293
And what if this doesn't work?

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.895
Mexico could fall

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.698
and I just sent 900 troops into
potential hostile territory.

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.501
My men could be marching
alongside the very troops

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.170
ordered to shoot them
in the back.

00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:28.239
Latest Intel does indicate a
growing rift within the country,

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.575
but for now, Northern Mexico
is standing strong

00:08:30.644 --> 00:08:32.109
against Gran Colombia.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:33.489
"For now" being
the operative phrase here.

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.580
To answer your question,
General Dufine,

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:38.783
if this doesn't work,
I plan to retreat out of Mexico

00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.318
and back to the Rio Grande.

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.319
After which, I suppose,
I'll be popping by

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:44.455
the President's office
to fall on the sword.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.457
Master Chief...

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:48.726
how long
have you been in the Navy?

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:51.329
Just north of 30 years, ma'am,
27 at sea.

00:08:51.398 --> 00:08:53.198
So maybe you can tell us.

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.067
What are the odds a smallboy
and two allied gunboats

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:57.869
can defeat an enemy fleet?

00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:01.539
Well, I stood
on the bridge of that smallboy

00:09:01.608 --> 00:09:03.208
while she took out
a Chinese fleet,

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:05.142
a Greek fleet,
an Astute-class submarine,

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.544
and a Russian
nuclear battleship,

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:09.214
each time without
an allied gunboat in sight.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.350
So when we talk about
Nathan James, ma'am,

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.686
there's no such thing as odds.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.555
Sir, the first, smaller virus...

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.024
The servo-motor instructions.

00:09:19.092 --> 00:09:20.336
Right,
the servo-motor instructions

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.893
manipulated one of
the satellite dishes

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.121
on the roof of this building,

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.563
shifting it
.125 degrees to the west.

00:09:25.632 --> 00:09:28.499
Now, a movement like that
is small but significant.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.167
Enough to redirect the dish

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.503
toward another satellite
within close orbit to our own.

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:35.506
- And we wouldn't even notice.
- Once the enemy satellite connected,

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:38.175
it sent the second virus
into our system.

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.311
In that moment,
we became a Botnet, sir,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.713
unwittingly relaying the virus

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.314
across the entire
military network.

00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:44.782
And for a good three minutes,

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.984
the enemy had total access
to our computer systems,

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.120
so they knew exactly
where our fleet was.

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:51.656
And they timed it perfectly
to shut us down

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.168
just as their attack planes
would've shown up

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.592
on our early-warning radar.

00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:56.994
Yes, sir. How did they
get the primary virus

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:58.307
into our building
in the first place?

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:00.265
I'm still not able to tell you

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.134
how our firewalls
were breached, sir,

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:05.002
but I'm confident I will.

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:09.340
Don't want to create
an outbreak of panic.

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:11.076
Find out
how we were compromised.

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:13.144
Do it quickly and quietly.

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:14.879
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.950
First ship has cleared
the sonobuoys.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.418
They're in column formation.

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:23.354
Safe to assume they have us
on radar by now.

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:25.823
We head west and they follow.

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:29.827
Gustavo's lead ship will
hit the minefield straight on.

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:33.431
OOD, come to course 2-6-5,
all ahead full.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:34.500
ODI.

00:10:34.568 --> 00:10:36.248
Helm, come to course 2-6-5,
all ahead full.

00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:38.369
Helm, aye,
all engines ahead full,

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:39.904
coming to course 2-6-5.

00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.042
Admiral,
they've adjusted course.

00:10:45.112 --> 00:10:46.644
Now heading north northwest.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:52.984
Detonation detected.

00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:55.653
Their lead ship was just hit
by a Mexican mine.

00:10:55.722 --> 00:10:56.722
Nice job, Aguilar.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.523
That should light a fire
under their asses.

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:01.258
Fire control, stay frosty.
Aye, sir.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.595
Nathan James,
this is Captain Aguilar,

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:06.464
confirming Alpha contact
is dead in the water

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:07.799
and sinking fast.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.001
Ships Bravo and Charlie
have adjusted course

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:12.137
away from the minefield
now heading southwest.

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.672
Captain Aguilar, have your
land battery at the ready.

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:17.342
They've headed for the shallows
near Cozumel for cover.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.810
Copy, Admiral Chandler.

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:20.345
Mexico's land battery
is standing by.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.879
CIC, Captain.

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:24.415
Keep an eye on those buoys
in case they double back.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:26.751
If the markers on either flank
start to give us a return,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.086
they've split their force
east and west.

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:30.956
T.A.O., aye.

00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.263
Tavo...

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.680
Fine.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.451
We'll do it your way.

00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:49.500
Sure that map is up to date,
Vasquez?

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:51.414
Looks like we're the first ones
to come through here

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:52.771
in a long time.

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:54.417
This is the safest way
around the villages,

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:55.840
away from people.

00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:58.176
Probably a good idea given
the bounty on our heads.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.177
Sí.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:00.579
The locals don't take sides,

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:03.248
but they take bribes.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.917
So much for the safe route.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.928
This way!

00:13:36.617 --> 00:13:39.350
Wolf!

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.619
I got him!
Cover me!

00:13:40.687 --> 00:13:42.821
Go! Go! Go!

00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.159
No! No!
No, Green!

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:51.562
This whole place
is wired to blow!

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:56.434
I got you!

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.569
Cover your face!

00:14:25.798 --> 00:14:28.333
You crazy bastard.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.804
Mine to the left!
I see it!

00:14:36.743 --> 00:14:39.010
We got them all.

00:14:39.012 --> 00:14:40.411
There'll be more.

00:14:49.155 --> 00:14:50.621
His tourniquet is gone.

00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:52.023
Take mine.

00:14:52.092 --> 00:14:54.625
Here.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.164
Wolf, don't look.

00:15:02.435 --> 00:15:05.103
Hey, we've only got 4 1/2 hours
to make it to that plane.

00:15:05.171 --> 00:15:07.238
I'm not gonna make it. We're
gonna be fine, buddy.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.639
We don't make it, dude.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.708
Leave me.

00:15:09.776 --> 00:15:11.376
No, we're gonna be fine,
all right?

00:15:11.444 --> 00:15:12.977
Stop.
No!

00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:15.380
It's all good!
Come on, man!

00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:21.786
We make it out, okay?

00:15:21.854 --> 00:15:23.988
Ready?

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:26.725
I got you.
I got you. Up!

00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:29.728
Get the gun.

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:36.667
Nathan James, this is Davila.

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:40.939
Confirming detonation on Bravo
contact's port side, midships.

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:42.941
Bravo's been hit
by the land battery.

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:45.410
Status? She's still afloat, sir.

00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:47.946
Mexico's positioning their ship
to finish them off right now.

00:15:56.356 --> 00:15:59.290
That's another, Nathan James.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.493
One more
Gran Colombian ship to go.

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:05.764
Bravo Zulu, Captain Aguilar.

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:19.144
They got Bravo.

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.513
That's two sunk.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:27.251
Radar contact.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.454
The third ship
has turned away from Mexico.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:31.300
Now heading directly for us.
Slattery; Bridge, CIC.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:33.458
Gran Colombia Charlie
is now in radar range.

00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:35.860
Sir, contact classified
as a Duke Class.

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.862
Weapons capacity,
stingray torpedoes,

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.131
quad Harpoon launchers,
4.5-inch gun.

00:16:40.133 --> 00:16:41.466
Nathan James, this is Davila.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:44.402
We are heading 0-4-0,
all ahead full,

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:46.337
in order to provide support.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.207
They're skirting the minefield.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:50.675
They must have kingfisher.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.544
I have detonations.

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:55.814
Mexican ship has been hit.

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.016
Aguilar.

00:16:58.084 --> 00:16:59.550
Davila, this is Nathan James.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.751
Do you copy?

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.223
I say again, Mexico,
this is Nathan James.

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.558
Do you copy?
We have been hit.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.295
Bravo got off a volley
while she was sinking.

00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:13.231
I have weapons remaining,
but no way to get to you.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.700
I am afraid it's up to you
and Cuba now.

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:18.703
Fuentes, Charlie contact
still bearing right for us.

00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:20.171
Do you copy?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.706
Cuba copies, Admiral Chandler.

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:24.309
We're ready to provide support
to the East.

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.577
T.A.O., surface radar
detects four bulldogs inbound.

00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:29.848
Calculate fire-control solutions
and let them close.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:32.050
Calculating.
Solutions acquired.

00:17:32.118 --> 00:17:33.429
General Quarters,
General Quarters, all...

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:35.654
Gator, count it down.
Six nautical miles.

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.834
Prepare countermeasures. Up
and forward on the starboard side,

00:17:37.858 --> 00:17:39.257
down and aft on the port side.

00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:42.260
Set the position...
Five nautical miles.

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.728
Launch chaff.

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:49.934
Two are still inbound.

00:17:50.003 --> 00:17:51.602
Engage with CIWS.

00:17:51.604 --> 00:17:53.872
CIWS, aye.

00:17:59.746 --> 00:18:02.113
Damn it. We're hit at
the starboard break.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.284
Away the flying squad forward
of frame 84.

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:08.619
Report damage,
decks 3, 4, and 5.

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:10.821
Torpedos are ready. Batteries
release port side.

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:20.498
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.567
Here we go!

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:31.242
Direct hit, sir.
They're turning away.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.843
Operating under their own power.

00:18:32.913 --> 00:18:34.312
Well catch 'em.

00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:40.118
Chief, fuel pressure at 10 PSI
and dropping.

00:18:40.186 --> 00:18:41.920
E-stopping, 1-Alpha, 1-Bravo.

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:43.654
Unable to cross-connect fuel.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.058
Bridge, Central.

00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.193
We've lost fuel pressure
starboard side.

00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:51.329
1-Alpha, 1-Bravo down
until we can restore.

00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:53.864
I need those engines, Chief.
ETR?

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.600
Sorry, ma'am, can't say yet.

00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:58.869
Cuba, you've got a Type 23
Duke Class heading your way.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:01.406
We slowed her down, but we've lost
propulsion and cannot pursue.

00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.074
Copy that, Admiral.

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:06.477
Adjusting course
south southeast.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.479
Cuba is prepared to engage.

00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.821
What the hell you guys doing?

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.222
We don't have time for this.

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:20.091
Save your energy, buddy.

00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:21.559
Anything?

00:19:21.628 --> 00:19:22.561
It looks dark inside.

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:24.429
But I could see some equipment.

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:25.630
So we bust in.

00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:28.032
There's got to be supplies,
medicine.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.913
You are not Gran Colombians.

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:43.248
Are you with the rebels?

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:46.851
Just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:53.858
Quickly, before anyone sees you.

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.417
Team leader, wha...

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:23.622
What's the status?! All
personnel accounted for.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.090
Four-inch cracks in firemain,
flooding secure.

00:20:26.159 --> 00:20:29.294
Investigating adjacent spaces
for watertight integrity.

00:20:29.362 --> 00:20:30.561
Good work, team.

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:33.097
Let's keep moving.

00:20:35.902 --> 00:20:37.480
We can't regain pressure without
that cross-connect valve.

00:20:37.504 --> 00:20:38.637
Alrighy, then.

00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:40.171
Time to think outside the box.

00:20:40.173 --> 00:20:42.740
How do we reroute pressure
starboard side?

00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:45.576
Air flask to the purifier?

00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:49.447
We could reroute fuel
directly to the intake valve.

00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:52.250
That might get us back
to 30 PSI we need.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.652
Nice work.
Tell DCA.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.386
Get a fire team on standby.

00:20:55.388 --> 00:20:56.787
Yes, sir.

00:20:58.124 --> 00:21:00.191
Fuentes, this is Nathan James.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.663
Charlie contact should be
coming up on your radar now.

00:21:04.731 --> 00:21:06.865
Cuba, this is Nathan James

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.667
confirming you have
radar contact

00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:12.003
with enemy ship
on your approach?

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.806
Cuba, do you copy?

00:21:15.876 --> 00:21:17.808
Anything?

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.745
No sign that Cuba
has engaged Charlie contact.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:22.280
Why aren't they fighting?

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:25.216
Why aren't they answering?

00:21:28.154 --> 00:21:29.420
Charge it, Diaz.

00:21:30.823 --> 00:21:33.024
Pressurized.
Ruiz.

00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:37.762
Energizing.

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.702
Ah! Cover it!
Cover that fuel.

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:49.708
Hose can't handle that PSI.

00:21:49.776 --> 00:21:51.842
Chief, you got to find me
something stronger.

00:21:51.844 --> 00:21:53.712
Get me some fire hose!

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.447
They can handle up to 150, sir.

00:21:56.516 --> 00:21:57.848
Let's give it a shot.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.252
Charlie contact has slowed
to three knots.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.856
And now they're out
of our radar range.

00:22:05.926 --> 00:22:09.327
Cuba, this is Nathan James
requesting your status.

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:10.861
Fuentes?

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:20.405
He's on his own now.

00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:37.600
Captain Green has damage
and fire-control teams

00:22:37.624 --> 00:22:38.935
doing everything they can
to reestablish

00:22:38.959 --> 00:22:40.959
our maneuvering capabilities.
In the meantime,

00:22:41.027 --> 00:22:43.561
the Cubans are running the lead
heading off the third ship.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.030
I will alert
the Commander-in-Chief.

00:22:46.099 --> 00:22:48.366
Commander?

00:22:48.435 --> 00:22:49.900
What's wrong, Ensign?

00:22:49.902 --> 00:22:51.570
Ma'am, our keycards.

00:22:51.638 --> 00:22:53.572
That's how they sneaked
the original virus

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.973
into the building.

00:22:55.041 --> 00:22:57.175
Each chip contains 400k of RAM.

00:22:57.244 --> 00:23:01.579
Only half of that's
actually used to open the doors.

00:23:01.648 --> 00:23:04.649
But there's still 200k
of unused junk.

00:23:04.717 --> 00:23:06.985
All someone had to do
was replace the junk RAM

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.053
with machine code.

00:23:08.121 --> 00:23:09.588
And when the card
came in contact

00:23:09.656 --> 00:23:11.055
with the security system,

00:23:11.124 --> 00:23:13.524
it delivered the code
that turned our satellite dish.

00:23:13.526 --> 00:23:15.059
It wormed its way
into the system

00:23:15.128 --> 00:23:17.061
and into
the servo-motor controls.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.664
These cards
are the only electronic element

00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.532
that doesn't go
into a Faraday cage.

00:23:21.602 --> 00:23:24.002
I do know it happened
at 2:16 p.m.,

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.137
two days before the attack.

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:29.940
That much is embedded
into the code, here.

00:23:29.942 --> 00:23:31.342
But that doesn't explain

00:23:31.344 --> 00:23:33.122
how the virus got into the card
in the first place.

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:35.614
Well, the ID badges
are low-wattage bluetooth.

00:23:35.682 --> 00:23:37.081
To hack in, all it takes

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.195
is for the card to be within
18 inches of the wrong computer,

00:23:39.219 --> 00:23:42.020
networked machine,
or even a cellphone,

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:44.555
and boom, now you have it.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:48.359
Now you have it.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.034
It's crazy, right?

00:23:57.904 --> 00:24:00.905
It's gonna take me days to
sort through all the real code

00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:02.641
and junk code
in everyone's cards

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:05.043
and then compare it
to the time log.

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:09.314
And I somehow have to do this
without raising alarm bells.

00:24:09.382 --> 00:24:11.049
Commander?

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:13.184
Commander?

00:24:13.253 --> 00:24:15.520
We'd better gets ours
out of the way.

00:24:18.391 --> 00:24:19.724
Thanks.

00:24:19.792 --> 00:24:21.459
Excuse me.

00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:23.261
Yeah.

00:24:52.893 --> 00:24:55.159
I got to go.

00:24:55.228 --> 00:24:57.962
No, I'm going through security.
I'll... I'll see you tonight.

00:24:58.031 --> 00:25:00.031
Wait, wait, wait.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.967
I'm sending you something
super important, hang on.

00:25:05.772 --> 00:25:08.306
Did you get it?

00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:10.375
I got it.

00:25:10.443 --> 00:25:13.311
I know it happened
at 2:16 p.m.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.114
Now you have it.

00:25:19.052 --> 00:25:20.985
Now you have it.

00:25:21.054 --> 00:25:22.787
Kelsi...

00:25:22.855 --> 00:25:25.790
what have you done?

00:25:31.732 --> 00:25:34.399
There's still risk of infection.

00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:36.401
The leg can be saved
if you can get him

00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:37.980
to a larger facility
as soon as possible.

00:25:38.004 --> 00:25:39.337
We can't thank you enough,
Doctor,

00:25:39.406 --> 00:25:42.673
and I know how risky it is,
your helping us.

00:28:12.559 --> 00:28:15.826
You need to take
these antibiotics every hour,

00:28:15.828 --> 00:28:17.028
on the hour.

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.429
I will, Doc.
Thanks.

00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:21.432
We have only 40 minutes
to get to the airfield.

00:28:21.501 --> 00:28:24.102
Out the back... now.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.037
Go.
Come on.

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.906
Gracias, Doctor.

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:37.448
Snipes say they still need time

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.917
to get us back up
to battle speed.

00:28:38.985 --> 00:28:41.920
Sonar, what do you got?
Still nothing, sir.

00:28:43.456 --> 00:28:45.167
If Cuba engaged, we would've
heard something by now,

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:46.791
even if it's just detonations.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.798
Sir, I'm getting something.

00:28:56.803 --> 00:29:00.071
Radar contact,
bearing 0-9-0 at 30 miles!

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.406
ID?

00:29:01.474 --> 00:29:03.141
It's too far away to ID, ma'am.

00:29:03.209 --> 00:29:05.076
I can't determine whether it's
Cuba's frigate or the enemy ship.

00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:06.544
Cuba, this is Nathan James.

00:29:06.613 --> 00:29:07.678
Do you copy?

00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:10.081
Fuentes, this is Nathan James.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:11.482
What's your loca...

00:29:15.422 --> 00:29:17.555
We're hit, forward o-country!

00:29:17.624 --> 00:29:19.424
I have the conn. Aye,
Captain has the conn.

00:29:19.492 --> 00:29:21.070
Engine room, bridge,
we need all engines.

00:29:21.094 --> 00:29:22.226
Connecting now, sir.

00:29:23.897 --> 00:29:25.029
Hit it, Ruiz!

00:29:28.902 --> 00:29:31.302
Pressurizing.

00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:33.838
Energizing.

00:29:41.714 --> 00:29:45.049
Engines 1-Alpha, 1-Bravo online.

00:29:45.118 --> 00:29:46.985
We have full power. All engines up!
Go! Go! Go!

00:29:47.053 --> 00:29:48.186
Gun it.

00:29:48.254 --> 00:29:49.387
All ahead, flank three.

00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:51.122
Helm, aye,
all ahead flank three.

00:29:55.128 --> 00:29:57.662
How did we not see
that missile coming?

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.330
Because it wasn't a missile.

00:29:59.399 --> 00:30:01.266
It was a shell.
Admiral?

00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:03.001
Sir, the ship that hit us...

00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:05.003
It's definitely not a frigate.

00:30:05.071 --> 00:30:06.671
What is it?

00:30:08.074 --> 00:30:11.009
It's a battleship.

00:30:11.077 --> 00:30:13.411
Bridge, CIC, EW confirms

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.880
contact is a battleship,
Iowa Class.

00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:21.019
Gator, charter course to evade.
Aye, ma'am.

00:30:21.087 --> 00:30:23.754
OOD, you have the conn.
Aye, OOD has the conn.

00:30:23.756 --> 00:30:26.757
Recommend course 0-1-0
for 1,000 yards.

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:32.430
Helm, set course 0-1-0,
all engines ahead for 19 knots.

00:30:32.499 --> 00:30:34.010
CIWS and five-inch
ready to engage, sir.

00:30:34.034 --> 00:30:35.634
Bounce right off a battleship.

00:30:35.702 --> 00:30:38.169
Getting in range is risky.
We don't have harpoons or TASM.

00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:39.304
Torpedos.

00:30:39.372 --> 00:30:40.617
How many we got?
Six all day, sir.

00:30:40.641 --> 00:30:44.309
Adjust torpedo ceiling
to zero depth.

00:30:44.377 --> 00:30:46.377
Ready starboard tubes.
Set.

00:30:46.446 --> 00:30:48.379
Batteries release
starboard side.

00:30:55.522 --> 00:30:56.855
They're turning.

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:04.329
Direct hit, sir.

00:31:04.397 --> 00:31:06.998
How many detonations?
One, sir.

00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:09.000
One ain't enough.

00:31:09.002 --> 00:31:10.669
Ready second salvo.

00:31:10.737 --> 00:31:12.937
That will zero out our
non-crew served weapons.

00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:13.938
Copy and confirmed.

00:31:14.007 --> 00:31:16.007
Valdez, prepare second salvo.

00:31:16.009 --> 00:31:19.077
Set. Batteries release,
port side, do it.

00:32:01.388 --> 00:32:04.923
Thanks.

00:32:34.154 --> 00:32:35.820
They're retreating.

00:32:35.888 --> 00:32:37.088
Toward Cuba.

00:32:40.093 --> 00:32:42.827
Captain, seal all
watertight compartments.

00:32:42.896 --> 00:32:44.695
Make way for that ship.
Negative.

00:32:44.765 --> 00:32:46.965
- Admiral, we'll never make it.
- They're hit.

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:48.877
We've got them on the run. We can
finish them now. We're taking on water.

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:50.835
I can't fight the ship
in this condition.

00:32:50.903 --> 00:32:52.437
Even if we catch them,

00:32:52.505 --> 00:32:54.065
we don't have the fuel
or the munitions.

00:32:54.107 --> 00:32:55.907
We'll barely get to Florida
as it is.

00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:58.109
We have to turn back, sir.
There's still time.

00:32:58.178 --> 00:33:00.378
We've lost half our bow! We
can't let them get away.

00:33:00.447 --> 00:33:03.448
Admiral.

00:33:03.516 --> 00:33:06.317
I am in charge
of the integrity of this vessel

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:07.918
and the safety of her crew.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.989
I cannot allow us to reenter
the fight in our condition.

00:33:11.057 --> 00:33:13.391
We have to return to home port.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.526
Captain's right.

00:33:15.596 --> 00:33:17.528
It's suicide, Tom.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:32.543
We're 60 nautical miles
from Key West.

00:33:32.612 --> 00:33:34.612
Southcom secured a dry dock
with our name on it,

00:33:34.614 --> 00:33:39.084
and there's ordered crew
standing by to service.

00:33:39.152 --> 00:33:41.218
Fuentes.

00:33:41.288 --> 00:33:43.821
I had him.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.690
Cuba was on our side.

00:33:45.759 --> 00:33:47.892
Gustavo must've gotten to him

00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:49.494
and gave him a better offer.

00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:51.229
Captain Aguilar says

00:33:51.298 --> 00:33:52.938
that Guatemala
just jointed Gran Colombia.

00:33:52.966 --> 00:33:55.633
They invaded Campeche.

00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:58.503
Mexico can't hold
the oil complex.

00:33:58.572 --> 00:33:59.704
So now what?

00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:01.372
They're gonna blow it up.

00:34:01.441 --> 00:34:02.974
They already did.

00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:05.176
God damn brave.

00:34:05.245 --> 00:34:08.646
Give up your own supply,
keep it from the enemy.

00:34:10.183 --> 00:34:11.983
They saved us
from certain invasion.

00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:14.319
Least for now. With any
luck, Kinkaid's army

00:34:14.387 --> 00:34:16.654
can help the Mexicans
hold the line

00:34:16.656 --> 00:34:18.255
at the Tropic of Cancer.

00:34:18.257 --> 00:34:19.857
Cuba.

00:34:19.859 --> 00:34:22.393
Friggin' Cuba.

00:34:22.462 --> 00:34:23.995
That battleship...

00:34:24.063 --> 00:34:26.998
I think we hit her
pretty hard, though.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.073
Turning back
was the right call, Captain.

00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:41.212
But you fought the ship well.

00:34:41.281 --> 00:34:45.483
It was an honor
to be there at your side.

00:34:45.485 --> 00:34:48.686
Thank you, Admiral.

00:35:15.048 --> 00:35:17.915
I'm sorry, Chief.

00:35:17.917 --> 00:35:21.252
It's time.

00:36:33.793 --> 00:36:39.731
Last radar contact had her
heading toward Florida.

00:36:39.799 --> 00:36:42.800
But the ship
is no longer a threat.

00:36:42.869 --> 00:36:45.536
The Gulf is ours.

00:36:45.605 --> 00:36:48.373
We are winning, Tavo.

00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:10.355
Baby, what are you doing home?

00:38:10.423 --> 00:38:12.290
Kelsi, I have terrible news.

00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:14.291
We need to get down to
the command center right away.

00:38:14.293 --> 00:38:15.627
I think our phones were hacked.

00:38:15.695 --> 00:38:17.028
What?

00:38:17.096 --> 00:38:18.407
Somehow the two of us
are at the center of all this,

00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:20.031
and I don't know
how it happened,

00:38:20.099 --> 00:38:21.877
but we need to get down there and
figure it out. Give me your phone.

00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:23.034
Wait, Alisha.
This is crazy.

00:38:23.102 --> 00:38:24.480
They're gonna separate us
and question us,

00:38:24.504 --> 00:38:25.971
but you need to be prepared,

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:27.705
but just answer
all their questions

00:38:27.707 --> 00:38:29.418
and they'll believe you. It'll all be fine.
Alisha, honey?

00:38:29.442 --> 00:38:31.576
Just calm down a minute, okay?
It's me.

00:38:31.645 --> 00:38:32.978
They have my keycard.

00:38:33.046 --> 00:38:35.046
They're tracking this to us
as we speak.

00:38:35.114 --> 00:38:37.582
We need to go now.

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.790
You're not coming, are you?

00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:53.865
I didn't want to believe it.

00:38:53.933 --> 00:38:55.132
All those questions.

00:38:55.202 --> 00:38:56.868
"Is Nathan James okay?"

00:38:56.936 --> 00:38:58.803
"Is Tom Chandler alive?"

00:38:58.872 --> 00:39:02.007
"Tell me,
tell, me, tell me."

00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:08.079
You used me as a weapon.

00:39:11.484 --> 00:39:13.951
How long?

00:39:15.955 --> 00:39:17.822
Since before we met.

00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:19.957
Why?

00:39:19.959 --> 00:39:21.693
How?!

00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:23.228
It was my duty.

00:39:23.296 --> 00:39:26.163
Surely, you can understand that.

00:39:28.835 --> 00:39:32.770
You're insane.

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:36.708
I'm insane?

00:39:36.776 --> 00:39:38.843
No.

00:39:38.912 --> 00:39:41.312
Insane is believing in lies

00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:43.514
and closing your eyes
to the truth.

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:46.051
Insane is having blind faith

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:48.854
in a corrupt power structure.

00:39:48.922 --> 00:39:50.388
No, we need...

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.125
What the people yearn for
is an awakening.

00:39:54.193 --> 00:39:56.928
Have you heard Tavo speak?

00:39:56.996 --> 00:39:59.464
Have you heard his message?

00:39:59.533 --> 00:40:02.734
"The first step towards tyranny

00:40:02.802 --> 00:40:04.201
is to believe

00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:07.873
the government will take care
of everything."

00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.077
Kelsi,
did I mean nothing to you?

00:40:12.145 --> 00:40:15.413
Oh, I did care about you,
Alisha.

00:40:15.482 --> 00:40:17.014
You should know that.

00:40:17.084 --> 00:40:21.152
And for awhile there,
I thought I loved you, but...

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.354
you and me, what we are...

00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:25.557
That doesn't even matter.

00:40:25.625 --> 00:40:27.892
Not now.

00:40:49.916 --> 00:40:51.983
That's Clay.

00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:53.384
He's figured it out.

00:40:53.453 --> 00:40:55.921
He knows it was my card
that was hacked.

00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:57.855
He'll track it back to you,
Kelsi.

00:40:57.924 --> 00:40:59.457
It's over.

00:41:09.937 --> 00:41:13.070
Shit.

00:41:42.235 --> 00:41:43.501
Come on, pick up, Alisha.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.837
Pick up, Alisha.
Pick up.

00:41:48.107 --> 00:41:50.041
Hi. You've reached
Alisha Granderson.

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:51.709
If you leave your name
and number,

00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:53.645
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.
