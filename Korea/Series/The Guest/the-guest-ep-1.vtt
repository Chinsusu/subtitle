00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.980
That thing...

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.160
comes from the East Sea.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.810
Come for some sushi.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.710
- Excuse me, come for some sushi. - What?

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.600
That thing possesses people.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.730
It penetrates into one's
dark side and weakness...

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.900
and possesses them.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.360
What is she doing?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.330
A person who is possessed by that
thing is no longer a human being.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.979
It enjoys the death of people,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.900
deceives them,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630
and laughs at them.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.840
Sohn comes from...

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.110
the East Sea.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.320
I hope this year is better.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.220
Let's do better this time.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.660
He has grown up so much.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.670
Hwa Pyung, come over here
and help the elders.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.270
Hwa Pyung, stop being rude.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.480
Turn down that TV!

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.150
That woman...

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.420
is staring at me so frighteningly.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.090
What woman?

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.800
That woman hiding behind you.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.570
That woman who has no hair.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.910
Are you going to do it again?

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.559
I told you not to say such
things in front of others.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.299
About 20 years ago,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.680
an elder's first daughter
died of lung cancer.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.939
She screamed in pain...

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.820
and caused quite a fuss.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.830
That's what he saw.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.139
A psychic has been born from
a hereditary shaman family.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.160
We need to accept it.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.800
That's the fate of a psychic.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.479
Answer me!

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.079
Didn't you hear what Mother just said?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.710
There's nothing Hwa Pyung can do about it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.740
Mom.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.240
Is there...

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.589
something wrong with me?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.310
No.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.550
But if you see something from now on,

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.769
just pretend you don't see
it, and just tell me.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.220
Okay?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.760
Okay.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.700
I don't like that mint-flavored candy.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.670
Why? This is my favorite candy.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.909
Why do we worship the wind and rain?

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.979
We pray that we will catch many fishes

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.730
and that ships will avoid accidents.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.530
- There is another reason too.
- What is it?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.479
Haven't you heard about the
ghost named Park Il Do?

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.170
Park Il Do?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.410
I heard this when I was a kid.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.040
A strange man suddenly came to our village.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.489
He seemed mentally ill.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.920
After that man came, some people
from the village disappeared.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.269
Rumors spread that they
were killed by that man.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.820
But it turned out that he
was possessed by a ghost.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.109
That ghost said that his name was...

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.469
Park Il Do?

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.560
Yes, Park Il Do.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.639
The villagers performed an exorcism,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.249
but failed. They tried to chase him away,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.019
and that man went wild.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.019
He stabbed his own eye with a knife...

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.810
and ran into the East Sea.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.819
He didn't die for days and
floated in the water...

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.580
staring at the villagers.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.729
Scary, isn't it?

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.999
Since then, people have been
saying, "Park Il Do is coming."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.420
"Sohn is coming."

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.269
- "Sohn?" - Yes.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.450
- You know, Sohn means guest... - Hey.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.290
What are you saying to a kid? I
wondered what you were saying.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.450
The mountain and the wind

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.219
- Yes! - Yes!

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.719
Go to the south of the river

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.029
But things go south

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.629
We humans are the rivers

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.799
We humans are the mountains

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.039
- Yes! - Yes!

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.239
The rivers make its bend

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.500
The mountains are too high

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.469
Now we are all gathered here
to pray for our wellbeing.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.579
Please provide this village
with water and light.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.609
We wish for a good harvest this year.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.479
Please fill our boats
up with loads of fish.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.549
Please bring peace to our
family and children...

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.579
and let us lead a healthy and happy life.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.489
We pray you will grant
each of our families...

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.559
all our wishes.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.829
We pray to you.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.729
Let us plant blue and red
flags on our boats...

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.099
and fill our boats with loads of fish.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.890
We pray to you.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.770
Look at him. He slipped.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.770
Come on, let's go now.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.340
Let's go.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.789
What are you doing?

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.410
Let's go.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.799
What happened?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.290
Where did he go?

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.309
What happened to him?

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.539
Where is he?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.960
What's happening?

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.279
Woong jin!

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.300
- Where did he go? - We should help him.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.709
Someone help him.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.540
- Someone help him! - What's happening?

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.170
Help him!

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.850
Sohn is coming.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.790
He's coming!

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.990
He's coming!

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.389
Woong Jin, how are you feeling?

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.810
Can't you still see through that eye?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.100
Go inside and rest, Father.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.570
Are you insane?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.409
Stop him!

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.749
Stop!

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.530
You!

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.210
Drop that knife!

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.970
This instant!

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.690
What on earth...

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.500
Please...

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.810
- What happened? - Hwa Pyung!

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.410
Hwa Pyung!

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.180
The doctor said...

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.490
that there's nothing wrong with him.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.990
Hwa Pyung.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.020
You still can't see through your right eye?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.300
No.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.910
What?

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.350
Do you see something?

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.950
You can tell me. Mom is here.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.420
It's telling me not to say anything.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.520
If I do,

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.760
it's saying it will kill everyone.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.760
Hwa Pyung.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.200
Hwa Pyung!

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.430
Hwa Pyung!

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.670
Hwa Pyung!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.040
Hwa Pyung!

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.820
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.690
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.530
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.800
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.300
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.870
Hwa Pyung!

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.859
- Oh my gosh! No! - Oh no.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.860
No!

00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:35.290
- Stop him. - Honey!

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:37.669
This can't be!

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.320
No, this can't be.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.560
Come on out. We have to begin.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.820
Please come visit us

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:44.069
My ancestral spirit Please come visit us

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:52.070
We're gathered here to pray

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.530
Please come visit us

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:03.140
We pray to my ancestral spirit

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.910
Please listen to our prayer

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.010
Get lost, evil spirit!

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.240
Take this!

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.129
Get lost, evil spirit!

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.920
Poor boy possessed by an evil spirit.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.729
He's possessed by an evil spirit
that committed suicide. Get lost.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.469
If you don't get lost,
I'll tell the master,

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.869
separate your flesh and bones,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.479
and cook you in a cauldron.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.070
You evil spirit, get lost!

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.380
You evil spirit, get lost!

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.130
- Honey. - Oh, my!

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.830
Oh, no!

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.419
Ma'am!

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.319
Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am!

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.280
Ma'am.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.589
He should be killed.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.110
What?

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.680
He...

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.050
Evil spirits possess humans and kill them.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.760
He is one of them.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.260
He controls small ghosts...

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.330
and lets them possess weak people.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:21.170
He's possessed by a powerful ghost.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.010
He should be killed.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.780
- Ma'am. - Ma'am.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.350
Hwa Pyung.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.320
Hwa Pyung.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.649
Father, how is my child?

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.470
He's not possessed.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.140
He doesn't react to the
bible nor the cross.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.610
There's no proof.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.680
If he's not possessed
by a ghost, what is it?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.850
My family died because of him.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.029
You said you were an exorcist priest!

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.260
Cut it out.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.760
You'd better watch your
mouth in front of priests.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.130
By the way,

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.339
what are all these scars?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.479
He did it to himself.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.870
He did it to himself with his own force.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.340
Is there anyone who would have
abused him behind your back?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.919
What did you say?

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.119
Are you saying I did it?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.750
I told you to stay quiet!

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.060
You'd better take him to a doctor.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.309
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.109
Father, you can't just leave like this.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.640
Tell him to leave.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.370
Cult freaks.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.040
Exorcist priest, my foot!

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.869
If there's anything you want to talk about,

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.490
come to the cathedral or my place.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.730
It's close from here.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.500
See you.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.810
I'd like to tell you something.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.450
Sohn...

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.900
Are you sick?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.389
No, I'm just worried about the kid.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.210
That happens a lot.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.380
Most of the cases turn out
to be domestic violence.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.580
Very little of them are actually
possessed by an evil spirit.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.450
By the way,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.190
you...

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.320
seem to be too weak for this job.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.860
You could end up letting it have...

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.460
control over you.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.160
No.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.700
Today, I've become assured of...

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.770
my belief.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.110
Belief?

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.040
All of a sudden?

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.610
I think I should go home.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.520
I miss my family so much.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.900
What brings you here?

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.940
There's good news.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.110
What news?

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.280
You'll know soon.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.250
Where is he?

00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.180
Yoon?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.450
He went to the private lesson.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.620
He didn't ditch school, did she?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.520
No.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.230
For the first time,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.370
I'm sure about my faith.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.040
What?

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.710
Why is the dog barking so much?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:32.280
Let me go have a look.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.160
Dad.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.990
I can...

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.700
see things now.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.889
He should be killed.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.010
Evil spirits possess humans and kill them.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.650
He is one of them.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.309
- Dad. - You evil spirit.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.900
Please stop.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.070
You are not my son.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.149
Die!

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.770
No!

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.640
No! Let go of him.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.559
- What are you doing? - Let go of me!

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.410
Leave him alone!

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:43.110
You told me when I was young...

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.320
that I didn't have enough belief.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.560
But why did you make me become a priest?

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:58.309
I told you I hated it! I
didn't want to be a priest!

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.830
I told you!

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.469
Hello?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.969
Is this Yoon's home?

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.630
Yoon didn't come to the
academy again today.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.500
Hey. What are you doing over there?

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.740
What is he doing?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.620
Hey.

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.920
Are you okay?

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.330
Over there.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.930
Over there. Inside there...

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.810
Wait here.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.220
Stay in the car. I'll be back.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.090
Aren't you going to talk to me?

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.780
I told you not to skip private lessons.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.490
May I help you?

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.990
There's a kid in front of your house.
Does he live here?

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.230
My little brother is at home.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.940
I see.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.170
It's so hot outside. Can
I have a glass of water?

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.710
I'm from the police.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.250
Come in.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.650
Thank you.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.520
There's no one home.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.890
I'll leave as soon as I drink this.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.030
I need to use the bathroom.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.099
I'm at a detached house near
Yoonmyeon intersection.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.380
Bring all the backup you can.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.230
Kid.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:59.840
Come here.

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:02.610
It's all right.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.920
Run!

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:23.390
Why did you hide him?

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.740
Hey, where's my mom?

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.159
Where is my mom?

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.750
I don't know!

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.099
You shouldn't go.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.590
You'll die if you go inside.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.710
Wait! Mom!

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.389
Mom!

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.829
- Stay away. - Mom.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:54.750
Mom! Wake up!

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.190
Mom! Mom!

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.220
Mom!

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.190
Wake up!

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.239
Mom! Mom!

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.760
Mom!

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.230
Mom! Mom!

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.940
Mom!

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.299
One meal set, please.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.439
All right.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.369
It's been three days since Lee Ha Bo...

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:10.869
went missing.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.930
Hey, newbie. Did you fill the quota?

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.449
Not yet.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.209
I'm not a newbie. I'm transferred.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.719
He's right. You've been driving a taxi...

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.389
in different cities, right?

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:24.749
Yes, I was looking for someone.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.580
That's unusual for a young man.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.759
Are you chased by a loan
shark or something?

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.180
Come on.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.850
Maybe he's looking for his
lover who ran away from him.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.950
I'll let you know when I find
your wife who ran away from you.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.720
Damn. What a funny dude.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.309
A 40-year-old man surnamed Jeong...

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.639
stabbed and killed staff
of a convenience store...

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.130
with a knife after an argument.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.800
After committing the crime, he...

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.280
Take us to any motel. Hurry up.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.560
Darn it.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.250
Why? What is it?

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.050
She's not your girlfriend, is she?

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.090
It's none of your business.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.920
You'd better be careful, if you
don't want to be arrested.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:50.809
- What? - Her brother...

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:52.839
is a police officer.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.460
You didn't know that?

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.189
How do you know that?

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.989
I have psychic ability.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.559
I'm supposed to have become a shaman,

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.010
but it's a long story.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:13.150
You seem to even have a girlfriend...

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.180
who has a temper.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:20.569
Let me see. She's got a phone
call from her brother.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.260
What are you going to do?

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.690
Damn it.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.449
Yes, I'm a taxi driver.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.470
Wake up and get out of the car.
You're home.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.880
Is this your place?

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:42.459
Who do you think you are?

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.659
- Pardon? - Gosh.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.899
I wanted to date him and
now you messed it up.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.520
Hey, I'm not paying for the drive.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.369
You have to pay.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.260
Hey, you have to give me money.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.290
My goodness.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.430
What a day.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.919
Hey, sorry I have kept you waiting.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.580
- It's okay. - Are you sure?

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.389
We have some time. Would you
like to go eat something?

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:20.299
- How about fried chicken? - Sounds good.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.920
- Let's go eat fried chicken.
- I can't wait.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.390
I've always wanted to watch this movie.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.610
Sorry, I've mistaken you.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.850
I used to have faith.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.890
Please give me a dollar
so I can buy alcohol.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:53.419
You're one tall man whose eyes are...

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.529
full of sexual energy.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.329
You'll waste your entire
life as a libertine...

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.099
with alcohol, women, and gambling.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:03.150
And when you're old, you'll get
soaked with poop on the street.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.790
What are you doing?

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:12.090
Hey, what are you doing at
my workplace at this time?

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.440
Did you hear any news?

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.510
About possessed people?

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:26.959
Don't talk about scary things at night.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.710
There's no news.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.299
Are you here to ask me
that question or to eat?

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.850
Both.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.629
Haven't you heard anything
from other shamans yet?

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.320
Including churches and Buddhist temples.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.190
There aren't many people who are
possessed by powerful ghosts.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.309
Maybe they think that
you're not good anymore.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.709
That must be why you don't hear anything.

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.130
Hey, you rude brat.

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.300
I'm Yukgwang.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:58.070
Six rays of light.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.519
If you're so frustrated,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.089
you become a shaman yourself.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.950
You're possessed too.

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.680
That was a long time ago. I'm not anymore.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.850
Do you ever call your grandpa?

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.090
Well,

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.060
sometimes.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:20.239
What is he called, Priest Choi?
Anyway, stop following him around.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.179
We can't deal with him.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.979
Do you even look in the mirror?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.100
Look what a mess you are.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.370
How can a young man like you
live like there's no tomorrow?

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.080
Are you here?

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.690
I hated it as a kid,

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:26.530
but now I wish I could still see spirits.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.900
Then I could see you, Mom.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.330
I'll catch him.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:59.160
I'll catch him...

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.960
by all means.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.540
Hey!

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.410
What are you doing there?

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.259
Please call the police.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.710
What?

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.850
Did you find something there?

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.120
My goodness.

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.439
I was supposed to be on
vacation from tomorrow.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.679
I promised my daughter I'd
take her to a water park.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.630
Water park? Forget about it.

00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:53.000
We already had so much to do,
and now we have a murder case?

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.070
Look who's here.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.710
What is she doing here?

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.740
Kang Gil Young!

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:05.780
My goodness.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.560
Is that how you bow to us? Is
your neck stiff or something?

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.560
There's an investigation going on...

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.679
to take disciplinary action against you.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.939
You should have stayed at the station.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.970
The result is not out yet.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.070
Who told her? You?

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.480
How can you eat at the scene?

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.840
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.450
- My goodness.
- You need to think before you act.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.029
The guy you beat up wants to
file a civil suit against you.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.129
What are you, a gangster?

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.539
He isn't a suspect. He's a criminal.

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.439
Also, he's been convicted of
sexual assault three times.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.890
- He deserves to be beaten to death.
- Cut it out.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.370
Send her back. Do as I say.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:05.510
Do you have some more?

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.410
Has he been identified?

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.280
The CEO of Shiil Service.

00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:17.420
His ID card, cell phone,
and wallet were all here.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.486
It seems like he died from excessive
bleeding after being stabbed, right?

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.390
He must have been stabbed
at least 15 times.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.949
He must have been transferred
here after death, right?

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:31.979
Yes.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.540
He must have been killed in a car
before being transferred here.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.089
The car is nearby.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.640
It is?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.889
That's strange.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.859
Everything about this is strange.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.920
The drain is completely
dry, but the body is wet.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.580
Could the water be from the reservoir?

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:51.050
- Where's the car? - Right over there.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.760
There it is.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:11.919
What a weird punk.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.180
Who? The killer?

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.910
Why would he leave his car here
and the body in the drain?

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.920
He could have hidden both the car
and the body if he wanted to.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:25.190
It looks as if he had a reason
to leave the body in the drain.

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.739
How would we know what
the killer was thinking?

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.790
We're normal people.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.379
Did you talk to the janitor?

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.030
Yes. But he said he wasn't the
first one to find the body.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:38.949
A young man found it first.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.479
A sly-looking taxi driver,
according to the janitor.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.789
A taxi driver?

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.670
Hey, stop it!

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.610
What is the taxi driver now?

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.690
Why do you want to know about our CEO?

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.890
He is involved in a criminal case.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:06.239
Do you clean drains too?

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.240
We do.

00:51:07.241 --> 00:51:10.349
Have you ever cleaned the
drains of Nakmak Reservoir?

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:15.440
Well... It was a couple of months ago.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.810
Something happened, right?

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.919
One of our employees got hurt.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.340
Hurt?

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.780
Cleaning drains is a pretty dangerous job.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:29.920
Our client was...

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.790
pushing us,

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.720
so our employee got seriously injured.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.960
Did that make him fall out with the CEO?

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.760
He was just a temporary worker.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:44.430
If our client keeps pushing us,

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.200
what can we do?

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:50.840
Many people seem to want to
know about that incident today.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.119
Was someone else here?

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.889
A taxi driver came...

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:56.959
and asked for Kim Young Soo's phone number.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:59.080
Did he look sly by any chance?

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.280
Thank you.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:05.399
By the way, where are you from again?

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.560
Well...

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.709
Our organization was founded recently.

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.209
We're looking into cases...

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:15.430
where workers were treated unfairly.

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.670
He had a choking accident in the drain,

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.249
which resulted in brain damage.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:27.410
He can't walk or speak properly anymore.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.120
It was raining so hard,

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:38.520
and they forced him to clean the drain.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.620
The CEO refuses to take responsibility.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.069
They say a temporary worker is not
entitled to any compensation.

00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.030
The big company that gave them
the work is just sitting back.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.470
They put all the blame on my husband.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.940
That's terrible.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.510
If I may,

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.380
I'd like to talk to your
husband for a moment.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:07.080
Sure.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.120
Hello, sir.

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.609
I have some questions for you.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.590
Do you understand what I say?

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.500
Well...

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.640
Have you ever...

00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.910
seen this man by any chance?

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.140
Who is he?

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:39.050
Has he ever been here?

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.190
Honey.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:51.460
What's wrong?

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:54.100
Honey.

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:00.370
Please go back now.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:05.219
If your husband starts to act strangely,

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.880
please contact me, okay?

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.289
Here's my number.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.580
Sorry? What do you mean?

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.569
He might start to act
like a different person.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.629
Then you need to call
me as soon as possible.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.399
I don't care if you call me at night.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.060
Do you understand?

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.160
Okay.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.030
Bye.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.300
Who are you?

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.189
Well, I just talked to your parents.

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:41.640
I'm from a social organization.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.020
Aren't you going in?

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.669
I have to eat and go to a private class,

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.590
but I don't want to go in.

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.860
Why not?

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.230
Are you scared of your dad or something?

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.049
How did you know?

00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.530
I know these things well.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:09.900
Don't worry too much. He'll get better.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:13.780
But his brain is damaged.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:18.510
He's not likely to recover.
I know that much.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.450
- You may be right. - But...

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.060
regardless of his injury, he's
been a little weird lately.

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:31.990
What do you mean?

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:36.000
He's like a different person.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.030
Did you see anything?

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.300
I have to go to a lesson.

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.819
Oh, I'm sorry. You said you need to eat.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:49.410
Here. Get something on your way.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.280
I can't take it.

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.820
I'll get in trouble.

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:14.240
Gosh. What is it?

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:17.149
I can't give you a ride.
I'm taking a break.

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:19.919
I'm from the police. Please step out.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:21.380
Why?

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.610
Am I not supposed to park here?

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:28.599
On TV, the police always
show their ID cards.

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.150
Are you really from the police?

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.230
You were at Nakmak Reservoir
this morning, weren't you?

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:39.590
Was I?

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.400
Well, a taxi goes everywhere.

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:46.300
I have a reservation. Can I go now?

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.219
Your hand. You could have hurt yourself.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:51.619
You have a wrong person.

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.759
You got caught on security cameras
around Nakmak Reservoir...

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.880
and at Shiil Service.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.480
It's you.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.650
Gosh.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.860
You have no criminal record.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.760
Yun Hwa Pyung, what were
you doing there so early?

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.900
I was just passing by. I'm
a taxi driver, you know.

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.170
It's a remote place.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:22.549
I had to pee. Fine, I peed on the street.

00:57:22.550 --> 00:57:24.170
Please forgive me this once.

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.059
Were you just passing by the
victim's former office too?

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.510
Yes. What's with this guy?

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.580
His face is a mess.

00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.339
You beat him up?

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.639
Can you still do that these days?

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.279
Hey. You want me to beat you up too?

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.779
Answer my questions.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.749
You said I was just a witness.

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:53.349
Gosh, are you allowed to do this?

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:57.049
If you keep this up, I will
have you arrested as a suspect.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:59.819
- Why? - Don't you think it's suspicious?

00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.240
What you've done.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.450
- You want me to tell you the truth? - Yes.

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.180
Well...

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.120
It'll probably sound strange.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:17.130
I have this special ability.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.069
What should I say?

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:22.130
I see things.

00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:25.300
It started when I was little.

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:27.619
Last night,

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.740
I suddenly saw the killer
leave the body in the drain.

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.040
Are you kidding me?

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.210
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:41.680
Hey, the first identification
result is out. Let's go.

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:43.550
Hold on.

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.629
What about me? I have an emergency.

00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.560
- What emergency?
- You won't believe me anyway.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.460
Wait here.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.530
Gosh. I really have an emergency.

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:00.749
He's the taxi driver, right?
Wrap it up and send him back.

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.449
He's really suspicious.

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:03.819
He visited both the victim's workplace...

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.819
and the injured employee's home.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.489
Why would he? That's really strange.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.129
Did they find anything on the body?

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:12.689
Salt.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.399
The body was soaked in seawater.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.729
Isn't that weird?

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.320
Was there seawater in
the drain or something?

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.199
There are 14 stab wounds.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.809
And they're all in random places.
What a crazy jerk.

00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:26.439
Either he's crazy or it was resentment.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:30.160
I think I should go back to
the injured employee's home.

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.740
You said he couldn't
walk or speak properly.

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.889
The killer left the body
in the drain on purpose.

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:39.410
I think it has something
to do with that family.

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.019
Also, those white sneakers...

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.540
White sneakers?

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.020
I'm going to work.

00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.860
What happened to these?

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.660
Water.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.070
Water.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.410
Why are you so thirsty these days?

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:12.749
I won't be back until morning.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.180
Water.

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:18.580
- All of it. - What?

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.490
Slow down. Hold on.

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.009
You have wounds on your hands.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:33.269
What happened?

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.130
Let's all die.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.879
Let's all die.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.300
Honey.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.640
What's with you?

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.540
What happened to your hands?

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.310
Let's all die.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.030
Honey.

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:09.500
I'm going to work.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.220
What?

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.050
Are you going to call that guy?

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.440
Honey.

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:52.040
You can speak...

01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:16.369
You look comfortable as if you're at home.

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:17.990
You must have been here a lot.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.930
You can go now.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.730
We checked your dashcam and
found nothing suspicious.

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:27.670
Hey. Say bye at least.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.900
Hey. What are you doing here?

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.500
Why are you back?

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.270
What is it?

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.110
Hey!

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.170
The body is wet again.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.180
Hey. What are you doing?

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:21.529
Neither her husband nor
her daughter is here.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:22.980
Her daughter?

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.220
I get it, so leave the scene. Right now.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.209
- Get out. - Fine.

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:35.530
I get it, okay?

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.720
What's that?

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.929
I think the daughter is alive.

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:27.799
Someone's life is on the line.
We have to do something.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.859
We need to make sure if
he is possessed first.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.199
We shouldn't rush.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.499
I think it's more dangerous for you.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.199
You seem to be possessed already.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.460
- Where is he? He's in there, right?
- Hold on.

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.809
He's going to perform an exorcism?

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:41.739
He's a taxi driver.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:43.879
We're dealing with something too dangerous.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.979
Are you possessed or something?

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.719
Where is your daughter right now?

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.900
Where is she? Tell me!
