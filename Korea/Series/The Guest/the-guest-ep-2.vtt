00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.269
Hwa Pyung, come over here
and help the elders.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.069
That woman is staring so frighteningly.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.139
A psychic has been born in a
hereditary shaman family.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.549
A strange man suddenly came to our village.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.779
He said his name was...

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.079
Park Il Do?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.219
Yes, he went mad and made a fuss.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.119
He stabbed his own eye with a knife...

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.619
and ran into the East Sea.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.850
He didn't die for days and
floated in the water...

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.829
staring at the village people.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.050
Hwa Pyung!

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.690
My family died because of him!

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.529
It's a powerful demon.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.099
We must kill him!

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.499
He hasn't been possessed.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.269
If you have something to say,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.439
come to the church or to my house.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.739
It's over there.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.410
I've become certain of my
belief for the first time.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.619
Over there.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.250
I'm from the police.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.780
You'll be okay.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.520
Hey, where is my mom?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.560
No, Mom!

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.039
I heard you wandered
around, driving a taxi.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.670
Yes. I was looking for someone.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.209
He was moved to the drain
after being killed.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.479
The drain is dry, but his body is wet.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.209
Why would he leave his car here
and the body in the drain?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.049
I have a strange ability.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.079
I was sleeping last night,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.789
and I suddenly saw the killer
leave the body in the drain.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.380
Are you kidding me?

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.720
I suddenly see things.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.699
Get your butt out of here. Now!

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.799
Okay.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.270
Okay, I'm leaving.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.650
Who is that?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.680
Stop right there!

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.950
Stop!

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.920
Darn it.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.630
I thought I'd never catch you.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.140
Your daughter.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.570
What did you do to her?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.510
I don't know...

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.880
what...

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.840
She was lying down on the ground...

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.480
and I stabbed her with a knife.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.980
Did you kill her?

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.129
Your wife, too?

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.690
Yes.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.620
I killed that talkative old lady...

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.930
and that man too.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.039
That young brat had soft skin.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.470
The knife went inside her skin so easily.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.370
She cried and begged for her life,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.640
and I shut her mouth.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.880
She suffocated...

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.820
and died.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.430
Stop it.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.570
It's over. Stop it.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.570
Get up.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.380
Since you confessed, I'll
take you to the station.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.210
Get up!

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.089
What are you doing?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.890
I said, get up!

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.090
My legs...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.600
My...

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.269
- He can't walk. - What do you mean?

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.030
He can't walk right now.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.070
I'll carry him to the car.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.060
Hey. Wait!

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.740
Open this door!

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.540
You jerk! Open this door!

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.689
Hey, wait. You can't come in.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.889
I told you not to bring
home spirits like this.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.559
No, you can't. I told you to
get out right now, you jerk!

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.799
I found him. Sohn has come.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.329
He's been possessed because of Park Il Do.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.039
We have to perform exorcism.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.509
No, wait. I said that you can't.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.579
That Park Il Do or whatever.
It's a powerful demon.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.279
We won't stand a chance against it.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.549
My body already hurts.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.319
- I can't do this. - What's wrong?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.719
Never! Just go over my dead body.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.919
- Move, I have to do it.
- Listen, Hwa Pyung.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.089
I tried my best last time too.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.589
I almost lost my life trying it!

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.420
What do we do then?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.469
Only a sacred being can
perform something like this.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.699
We don't have time. This man
almost killed himself earlier.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.569
We have to perform exorcism!

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.069
He is driving me crazy.
He just doesn't listen.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.910
Hey, I knew this would happen, so
I invited some powerful people.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.260
Do we have to go to the shaman's house?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.290
Yes, we must go.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.560
If someone is possessed,
we sure have to go.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.149
Let's see how good you powerful people are.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:36.310
Don't be rude and call
these priests like that.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.459
- I apologize. - I don't care who they are.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.620
All they need to do is find Sohn.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.650
I'm in a hurry, so let's do it.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.899
What are those wounds on his face?

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.569
Did you do that?

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.660
No. A detective who goes crazy
when she sees criminals did it.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.400
He seems unconscious.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.239
Did you see his symptoms?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.579
Yes, I saw everything.
He has been possessed.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.819
You must see if he is really possessed.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.249
He killed his own family.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.349
He couldn't talk or walk properly,
but he ran away from me.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.489
I told you he has been possessed.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.450
Are you a shaman too?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.629
I'm a taxi driver. Okay?

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.190
Then wait outside. You're interfering us.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.269
I have much more experience
in things like this than you.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.499
- Understood? - Although I'm inexperienced,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.369
I know the procedure well.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.900
We must check if he's
really possessed first...

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.109
and we must not hurry.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.270
He might die if we don't hurry!

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.020
He has woken up.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.660
Are you all right?

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.140
You smell...

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.250
very filthy, don't you?

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.590
Let go of me.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.220
Stay still, you jerk.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.100
Tie him up tight!

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.049
Will you be okay?

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.479
- We didn't receive permission.
- We have no choice.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.280
- We have no time. - Let's begin.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.789
I will perform this exorcism...

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.859
according to Article 1172
of the Catholic Rule...

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.660
- based on the procedures...
- Just get on with it!

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.530
Father, give me the power...

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.369
You two need to go out.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.199
No, I have something to ask this guy.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.709
You can't. You might be possessed too.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.669
You should worry about yourself.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.409
Isn't this your first exorcism?

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.879
You sound like you've
already been possessed.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.749
What did you say? You jerk...

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.419
Hey, stop it. What's wrong with you?

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.789
It's important to perform
exorcism, so let's go out.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.580
- Come on, let's go. - Darn it!

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.789
Let's go out.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.090
Good luck, then.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.229
I told you to hold your temper!

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.890
Let's begin.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.369
Your Holy Spirit, Benedict.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.730
Give us the strength.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.240
Your Holy Spirit, Benedict
who has chased away demons.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.840
Give us the strength.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.040
Your Holy Spirit, Benedict.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.759
Your Holy Spirit, Benedict
who has chased away demons.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.620
No!

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.399
He who has abandoned idol worshiping...

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.330
He brought home his daughter.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.600
He secretly peeked at his daughter.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.310
And he felt aroused.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.489
He who has abandoned idol worshiping...

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.550
I'll take care of you tonight.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.590
But then, she was caught by her stepfather.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.890
She was beaten...

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.830
and was abused.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:50.630
When she was dying from cancer,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.040
he went to see her at the hospital.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.840
He was happy!

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.950
Wait a minute.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.890
Were you there?

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.460
Am I right?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.990
You were there.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.100
This is where you were hiding.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.730
It's you, isn't it?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.779
- I knew it was you! - Don't look at him!

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.470
Go outside.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.610
Get out.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.510
Now!

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.120
Why did you come out? Is it over already?

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.959
He will do it on his own.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.560
What?

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.960
Why is he doing something like that alone?

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.200
That startled me.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.140
My goodness.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.979
- Who is that?
- Darn it. She's already here.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.940
What? Who is it?

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.710
Who is that?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.189
- Hey. - Where is he?

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.229
Hold on. Listen to me first.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.599
A ritual is being performed right now.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.260
What?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.199
Who are all these people? Is he inside?

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.430
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.300
It may be hard to believe,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.439
but that man has been possessed,
and needs exorcism...

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.739
- Goodness. - Wait, lady.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.370
Wait!

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.810
What is that? Is she a policewoman?

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.150
Father.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.550
It's all over.

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.960
What?

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.080
Hey.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.819
I'm going to be back with a warrant.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.089
I don't care whatever you'll bring.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.429
He's definitely possessed.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.529
You should rather be thankful to me.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.590
You're crazy.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.700
You said you had to eat.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.310
Buy some food with this.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.310
No.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.310
My mom is going to scold me.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.480
No.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.020
My mom is going to scold me.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.690
Wait. Hold on.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.730
Be careful of his eyes.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.340
Why?

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.910
- I think we failed. - What?

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.519
Are you okay?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.820
Yes, I'm okay. Let's take a walk.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.690
I think I need to quit this soon.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200
What?

00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:34.969
I told you.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.699
If you exorcize for a long time,
your soul slowly gets eaten...

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.400
by them.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.869
But you made it this time.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.009
It was just a weak spirit.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.239
There's something suspicious.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.540
I think it's controlling them.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.419
It's too powerful for us to deal with.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.849
What?

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.480
That guy.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.980
That taxi driver guy.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.680
He provoked something very dangerous.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.750
Mateo.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.260
You shouldn't be involved.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.560
Father.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.700
What?

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.400
What is my step-father doing here?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.810
Father!

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.150
I think he's actually just a sick person.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.120
If not, he's such a good actor.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.290
Hey, I saw you running here
and there, and jumping.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.860
You even had a physical fight.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.760
Water.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.669
Water.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.800
Seriously, are you kidding me?

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.579
Doesn't it smell somewhat fishy here?

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.679
It's getting worse.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.410
Water.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.819
Water.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.949
Get him some water.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.550
Okay.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.269
- Hey, what are you doing? - Stop it.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.139
- Stop it. - Relax.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.869
- You could hurt yourself. Stop it.
- Stop it.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.430
Stop it.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.470
Stop.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.970
Itchy.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.440
It's been itchy since that day?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.280
Since...

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.019
the day he came.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.729
Since the day he came?

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.829
You understand him very well.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.490
- Write it down. - Okay.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.060
Who is he?

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.300
He is...

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.970
from the ocean.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.170
We...

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.540
came from the ocean.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.820
Park Il Do!

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.560
Stop him!

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.739
- Get out of the way! - What happened?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.140
What happened?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.949
- Call an ambulance! - Call an ambulance!

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.910
- Call an ambulance!
- Hey! Call an ambulance!

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.130
Yoon Hwa Pyung. Yoon Hwa Pyung!

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.209
How did you know that?

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.240
How did you know he would poke his eyes?

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.070
I told you.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:44.649
I told you he's possessed.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.780
I said I could see what
possessed people do.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.850
Are you still saying that?

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.619
You're crazy.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.329
It sounds crazy, right?

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.350
What can I do? That's what I see.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.359
You want me to believe that?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.360
Both the corpse from the
sewer and Mr. Kim's wife...

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.390
had sea water in them.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:06.599
That's...

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.800
The police find it strange too.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.679
That's what happen when you get
killed by a possessed person.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.909
Everyone who was killed and
related to Park Il Do,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.509
the powerful spirit,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.449
was soaked in sea water.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.710
And they kill themselves
by poking their eyes.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.220
Look.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.959
It suddenly started again four years ago.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.059
All of them are cold cases.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.460
It's killing more people these days.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.060
Let me meet the culprit.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.269
Are you going to do
something like exorcizing?

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.240
Yes, I need to kick it out.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.710
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.840
Ma'am!

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.350
Hey, let's talk later.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.590
His daughter is alive.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.769
A fire accident from...

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.109
December 30, 2014 that killed a family.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.339
Of course I remember that.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.039
Since it was the end of the year,
there were many accidents,

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.309
but I still remember that accident vividly.
It was so odd.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.809
Was it really a suicide?

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.279
That's how it was concluded.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.289
There was no evidence
of break-in nor murder.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.650
The corpses were greatly
damaged because of the fire.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.089
Were there any other strange things?

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.390
Strange things?

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.359
Right.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.469
The second son had a pierced
wound on his one eye.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.569
On his one eye?

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.569
It seemed like he injured himself
with something like an awl.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.060
There was a big wound on his one eye.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.739
Everything was odd about that accident.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.170
There was no reason for the
family to kill themselves.

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.540
I see. Thank you anyway.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.929
I'm sorry.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.359
Belly button? What does that mean?

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.759
I love you. Are you happy now? Okay.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.360
I'm busy. Let's hang up. Bye.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.799
You must've been nagged a lot.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.300
My life is tough both at home and at work.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.270
How is he?

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.239
Since I've become a detective,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.039
I've dealt with murderers,
rapists, and gangsters.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.670
But...

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:30.209
he's different.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.049
When his one eye stops
rolling and stares at me,

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.250
it creeps me out.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:38.250
Bong Sang.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.480
Do you trust me?

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.850
What?

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.620
What is it? What now?

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.680
Your daughter is alive, isn't she?

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.620
You tied her and locked her up.
Where is she?

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.529
He's peeping us.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.299
He reacts to us.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.500
Even dogs and pigs can
feel when they're slashed.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.430
What are you doing?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.100
Aren't you excited as well?

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.009
Am I wrong?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.870
That blood.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.410
You like that, don't you?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.650
Just tell me where your daughter is.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.820
He's still looking for his daughter.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:50.720
Later,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.760
let's drain all the blood
out of the little girl...

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:01.130
and kill her slowly.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.270
Why this family?

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.770
They're innocent.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.140
Innocent?

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.240
It's what this man wanted.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.210
He wanted them all dead.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.289
It was unfair...

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.920
and frustrating!

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.659
If the client doesn't want to get involved,

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.130
who is going to take responsibility?

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.230
What about his hospital bills?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.870
He'll be bedridden for
the rest of his life.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.270
The three of us...

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.140
will starve to death.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.779
Please help us, sir.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.480
This man was...

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.089
in despair, right?

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.350
He was. He was in despair.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:59.059
He wanted to kill his family...

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.460
and himself.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.530
That's why you killed his wife?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.730
One's...

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:15.000
dark side...

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.810
That's why...

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.080
he chose the man...

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:30.150
and we came.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.660
How did this man meet Park Il Do?

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.529
Where is Park Il Do?

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.029
See?

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.169
We should tell him.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.909
He'll die before he finds him.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.570
He is a hunter and a predator.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.470
This is his eye!

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.910
Hey.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.780
Run away like last time.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.950
Keep running.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.629
Run away.

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.250
Park Il Do is in Priest
Choi's body, isn't he?

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.890
Priest Choi's little brother.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.899
Little brother?

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.330
Yes, the priest's little brother.

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.439
He's around your age.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.870
His family died because of you.

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.570
You made him an orphan.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.310
What about him?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.489
I should have killed the little brother,

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:32.759
but that female police officer interfered.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.359
I told you not to skip private lessons.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.750
Come here. It's all right.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:39.999
Run!

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.569
I should have beaten him up...

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.460
to death.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.840
The priest is...

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.549
on his way to...

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:04.850
his little brother!

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.880
You jerk.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.409
He's not going to tell us
where his daughter is.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:05.019
You said you saw something.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.680
Do you have any idea?

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.710
It was an enclosed place.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.620
I'm not sure if it's a
storage room or a basement.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.330
If she’s confined there
too long, she might die.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.599
We have to find her soon.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.630
I'll bring exorcists.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.279
Forget it.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.540
I'll find some more information
about Kim Young Soo.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.210
Hey. But what you said...

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.450
Forget it.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.199
Hey. Have you contacted the priests?

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.800
Yes.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.270
But there's a problem.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.320
It was an accident.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.420
No, it wasn't.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.860
He was killed by Sohn. His exorcism failed.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.790
I see.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.500
It failed.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.739
I should have realized earlier.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.709
I was being hasty too.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.370
By the way,

00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.979
why are you here?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.080
- That man... - I quit.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.850
I can't do it anymore.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.920
There are no other exorcist priests.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.159
That man's daughter is still alive.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.199
She's locked up somewhere.
We have to find her.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.160
Ask the police.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.060
Do you think they'll believe me?

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:06.299
He'll think I'm a lunatic.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.460
The girl's life is on the line.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.140
Both the man and the girl might die.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.980
If you keep being so hasty,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.889
you might really die.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.189
Yes.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.159
I admit that I was hasty.
It was an emergency.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.419
But this is an emergency too.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.750
A person's life is on the line.
We have to do something.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.060
He is under complete control of the demon.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.430
There's nothing we can do.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.930
So you're just going to sit back?

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.370
You're just going to run away?

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.849
Are you really a priest?

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.780
Are you scared? Because
your mentor got killed?

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.610
Stop...

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:00.620
pretending you're saving
everyone by yourself.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.920
You don't understand demons.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.990
You've never even suffered because of them.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.060
I've never suffered?

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.469
What do you know about me?

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.139
Don't pretend you're surprised.
You're running away like a coward.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.370
Exorcist priest, my foot.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.760
Gosh.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.020
- My dear... - Gosh.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.999
Why do you look so upset?
Like you stepped on poop.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.590
How did it go?

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.090
That young priest...

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.060
isn't interested.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.560
Can't you do it yourself?

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.239
Have I ever refused to help you?

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.679
This time, there's nothing I can do.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:58.209
It's an extremely superior spirit.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.880
It'd kill me.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.319
You look so strong on the outside,

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.359
but you're just a coward.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.189
Do you know any other exorcist priests?

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.350
Couldn't you work things
out with the young priest?

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:14.799
He's more famous than you think.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.439
The late Priest Han was
sick for many years,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.399
so the young priest had
to do most of the job.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.439
He did?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.809
Yes. He's incredible.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.139
Right. I heard...

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.940
he is looking for someone
just like you are.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:37.389
Whatever. I'm not interested. I'm leaving.

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.959
Where are you going?

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.250
You said you can't do it.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.359
I'll have to talk to
other monks or priests.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.120
It's an emergency.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.130
All right. You don't have to yell at me.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.400
Darn it.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:56.510
One could really die.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.370
What's the emergency?

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.710
It seems like his daughter is alive.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.480
What makes you think so?

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.989
There's no blood stain on the knife.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:11.819
He left his wife's corpse at the scene.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.980
If he killed his daughter, her
corpse would have been there too.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.759
He must have kept her alive
and locked her up somewhere.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.059
He said himself that he killed
her during the interrogation.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.569
He said he dumped her
body into the reservoir.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.890
I think he wasn't sane when he said that.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.239
I'll check out the places that
are related to the culprit.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.270
- I need a search party... - No.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.839
I already reported we will...

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.240
look for the body at the
reservoir with the police.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.519
Didn't you hear I just said
I reported it already?

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.919
If we don't do anything about
it, she could actually die.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.119
That's what you think.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.659
Is there an evidence that she's locked up?

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.290
Is there?

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.120
- No. - See?

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.069
Go keep an eye on the culprit.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:58.860
Don't let him hurt himself again.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.769
You dishonored Violent Crimes Unit Two.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.800
The superiors are really upset.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.940
Why is she so stubborn?

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.960
No, it shouldn't have been this way.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:51.130
He should've done it.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.880
You...

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.810
You should have done it!

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.919
My goodness.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.049
It can't be helped.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.780
This is insane.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.220
- You're here. - My goodness.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.599
I have no idea what's going on.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.099
What have you been doing
until it went this far?

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.660
Enough.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.769
He doesn't even have family.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.869
Mateo, it must be a lot of work for you.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:59.439
By the way, what will
you do with his body...

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.439
after the funeral?

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.509
Aren't we burying it at the
parish natural burial?

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.949
No, we can't. It's a suicide.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.489
The police said it was a suicide.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:11.189
My goodness.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.759
How could a priest commit a suicide?

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.959
This is totally insane.

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.029
He was too into those things.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:21.620
I heard he was sick and
a little lunatic too.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.769
Exorcist priest sounds cool,

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.499
but there are no demons these days.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.869
He could have just counseled
mentally ill people.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.140
- He didn't have to... - No.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.339
He helped a lot of people.

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.379
What?

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.379
He actually helped people.
He didn't do it for nothing.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.619
What are you saying?

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.980
He's been having a lonely fight.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.819
Don't judge him because
you don't know anything.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.550
How dare you!

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.459
Mateo, you're being rude.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.599
He was a real priest unlike someone...

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.729
who collects donation and
gets food from the people.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.060
How dare you...

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.069
You're just like him.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.739
You're just as pathetic as him.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.300
Just go.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.170
Goodness.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.410
We should talk later.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.600
Where's your daughter?

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.440
She's alive, isn't she?

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.940
Where is she?

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.950
What?

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.820
It's dangerous.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.609
His daughter will die soon.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.239
You freak!

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.549
Calm down!

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.810
Get out.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.180
Now, we're going to find
where his daughter is.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.280
Come out!

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.849
Get him.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.420
Are you okay?

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.690
Yukgwang, wake up.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:12.990
Yukgwang.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.090
Take him outside.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.229
I'm going to take care of it from now on.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.430
All right. But being
alone here is dangerous.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.170
I said I'm going to take care of it.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.100
- Let's get out of here. - Let's go out.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.860
What is going on right now?

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.130
Well...

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.460
You said that you'd believe me.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.500
So tell me what this is. Are you...

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.000
Is this something bad?

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.900
I'll take full responsibility.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.510
I really have no idea what to say.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.819
And who are those two?

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.110
It was inside the water.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.550
It was really...

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:16.290
inside the water.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:19.120
Those black eyes...

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.560
Hwa Pyung.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.600
- I think I... - Okay.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.330
I know, Yukgwang.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.269
You did well. I have to go.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.179
Where are you going?

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.749
Listen to me. It's really a powerful demon.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.080
I told you that I didn't want to do it!

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.219
I told you I'm in a hurry.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.880
Where are you going?

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.180
Yukgwang.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.650
Don't let anybody in during the ritual.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.590
Bong Sang, don't let anybody in.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.120
- Hey. - Where are you going?

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.750
What are you looking for?

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.589
When Park Il Do possessed Kim Young Soo,

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.980
I'm certain he used something.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.990
And that is?

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.560
We have to look for it now.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:31.690
Look for it with your eyes.
Don't touch anything.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.820
Hey!

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:21.070
In the name of the Father and Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.380
The Angel Saint Michel.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:35.319
Protect us from the fight
between power and violence.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.850
Protect us from the rulers
of this dark world...

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.399
and from the fights...

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.860
- between sinners. - I killed her.

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.030
I hit her with a car.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.669
What did I say? I told
you I would kill her.

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.170
Please tie up the dragons and
snakes possessed by the demon...

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.139
with chains and send them...

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:57.910
What should I do with you?

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.940
Should I kill you like that man?

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.410
Should I kill you like his wife?

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.789
Please save the people from temptation.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.420
Die!

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.160
Die!

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:19.290
I said, die!

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:22.160
Like that old priest!

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:24.770
Die!

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.450
Please send Satan and demons...

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.280
and chase them away from this world.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.289
- This way. - What is going on right now?

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:46.499
Let's go have a talk.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.999
Wait a minute. What is going
on in there right now?

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.529
It's nothing at all.
Just a religious event.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:55.599
What else would a priest do? Don't mind it.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.870
Have a seat.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.460
Mr. Kim Young Soo.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.760
Can you hear me?

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:32.630
My daughter...

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.040
Soo Jin.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.570
Soo Jin...

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.240
Your daughter.

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.710
Where is your daughter right now?

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.020
My...

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.390
Soo Jin...

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.640
I told you not to touch anything.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.010
Hey.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.770
What are you doing?

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.390
You're ruining the crime scene.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:27.120
What shall I do?

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.480
Shall I kill him?

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:32.250
Shall I?

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.890
Everyone who stays near him will die.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.060
He is just like us.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:54.080
Hey.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.350
Are you okay?

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.240
I have to hurry.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.440
You punk.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.750
What are you doing?

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.919
Hold on.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.929
Let me go.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:46.150
Just a second.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.449
I just did something weird, didn't I?

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:11.889
You jerk.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:13.719
Are you possessed or something?

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.529
I was just reacting to the possessed man.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.490
It happens from time to time.
That's why I can see murders.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.120
I showed a strong reaction
because this is a murder scene.

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:25.469
Gosh.

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:29.000
I just saw Kim Young Soo and his daughter.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.770
It's true. Please believe me.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.500
Hold on.

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.209
- There. - What?

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.040
I see something.

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.689
I command you...

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.060
to leave this man's body right now.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:58.790
Get out! He's already dead.

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.800
This guy is already...

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:05.530
Help me.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.500
Who are you talking to?

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.109
Are you controlled by a
more powerful spirit?

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:14.079
Help me!

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.279
A superior sprit is controling you, right?

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:17.349
Tell me.

00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:18.989
What do you see?

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.780
Please look inside the
range hood right now.

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.490
Gosh.

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.160
Tell me.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.109
Where is it?

00:57:12.110 --> 00:57:13.740
Tell me!

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.110
I command you...

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:26.910
to tell me the name of the superior spirit!

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.929
Please!

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:31.729
Tell me the name of the superior spirit!

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.460
I command you!

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.869
Everything is all right.

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.139
I hear some noise.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.309
It's just a religious ritual.

00:57:43.310 --> 00:57:45.069
You've never been to a church?

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.379
Why would they have a
religious ritual here?

00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.639
What else could a priest do?

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.709
He hands out candies,

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.179
- cookies and all. - Move out of the way.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:56.449
Hold on. You can't go in there.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:58.349
Father! Move out of the way.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.420
Open the door! Open the door!

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.629
Tell me his name!

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:06.250
Park...

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:10.020
What?

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:12.890
Park Il...

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.939
Do!

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.030
What's going on?

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.000
Park Il Do?

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:39.510
I command you...

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:44.010
to leave this man's body right now.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:48.459
Help me.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.190
I command you...

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:53.960
to leave...

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.720
this man's body right now.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:18.750
In the Name of Father, the Son,

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:23.380
and the Holy Spirit, I command.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.360
Get lost, evil spirit.

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.830
Go back to where you came from.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.660
Our Lord is the one...

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:40.840
who has the most power.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.210
In the name of the Father,

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:47.980
and of the Son,

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.210
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.820
Amen.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.140
Father.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:26.410
What is this?

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.480
Please call Detective Kang Gil Young.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:32.890
Kim Young Soo will tell her...

01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:37.290
where his daughter is.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.940
That way.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.670
Down there!

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.000
Are you okay?

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.970
- Hurry up. - Hold on. It's okay.

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.120
Are you okay?

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.390
It's okay.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.900
It's all fine now.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.449
Where is Park Il Do?

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:32.609
She was kidnapped and murdered.

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.179
I saw a dead woman in a trunk.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.079
I clearly saw it.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.149
There has been no such report.

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:39.549
It's just that the body
hasn't been found...

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:41.859
because the killer is carrying
it around in the trunk.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:44.529
Are you sure you saw it?
Is there any evidence?

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:46.289
If the third woman turns
out to be the right one,

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:49.359
- the police will work on it.
- Forget it. I'll find her.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.930
I saw the superior spirit. Park Il Do.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.960
Who is this jerk? Park Il Do...

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.149
- Are you ready? - Everything is set up.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.570
Then let's get started.

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:14.310
Money-stealing action drama.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.720
"Player".

01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:17.489
There are always unexpected situations.

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:18.729
Go get him!

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.289
Please find it.

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.499
We don't know what he
might be doing out there.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.269
Let's start for real.

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:26.099
Be careful. I don't feel good about this.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:27.740
Stop while I'm still patient.
