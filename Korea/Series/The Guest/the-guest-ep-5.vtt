WEBVTT

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:24.454
Park Il Do?

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.184
We stabbed his own eye with a knife.

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.725
And ran into the East Sea.

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:29.455
Hey, what about my mom?

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:32.326
The superior spirit called Park Il Do.

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:34.465
The people who were involved all died...

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.035
and were drenched in sea water.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.535
I heard that he's looking
for someone, just like you.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:41.875
What on earth is that? Sohn?

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.374
It's when a person is
possessed by a spirit.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:46.176
That's what we used to say in my hometown.

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:47.845
"Sohn is coming."

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:49.114
Run away.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:50.545
Who is he talking to?

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:52.362
Is there another bigger
spirit controlling you?

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:53.916
Park Il Do is the superior spirit.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:56.184
It controls inferior spirits.

00:00:56.185 --> 00:00:58.286
And inferior spirits possess human beings.

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:00.895
Park Il Do has possessed
someone else right now.

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:02.496
And it keeps killing people.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.505
Are you saying he's been
possessed by a spirit?

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.226
I'm looking for Priest Choi.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.366
Actually, I'm looking for the
spirit that used to possess me.

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.685
- I'm looking for Park Il Do.
- Let's stop talking about that.

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:16.806
A man came out of the trunk.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:18.946
Do you mean there are two culprits?

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.276
Did you see what I was thinking?

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:22.875
When did you meet Park Il Do?

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:25.785
You'll never find him...

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:28.586
because I'm going to kill you now!

00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:34.356
Where is your brother?

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:42.395
It's too late.

00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:43.836
I'm looking for my brother too.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.636
You want your brother back.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:46.806
I'll help you.

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:01.785
What are you doing?

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.256
Hey!

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.495
Wait, stop.

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.765
Park Il Do!

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.076
Move aside.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.984
What happened?

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:32.244
What's the matter?

00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.815
- Move aside please. - Did someone die?

00:02:34.816 --> 00:02:36.655
- Sir. - What happened?

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.756
Please move.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:46.465
That crook taxi driver
was telling the truth.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:48.765
Yes.

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:53.476
He followed the same taxi by
coincidence and found out?

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:56.436
This is absurd.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.005
He saw the last case by
coincidence while he was peeing?

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.175
That's what he said.

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:04.615
He might catch all the criminals
while he's peeing on the street.

00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:06.345
And who is that priest?

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:09.055
And that strange shaman?

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:11.325
The suspect chewed off his hands...

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.826
and poked his eyes... Goodness!

00:03:14.555 --> 00:03:15.696
What is happening?

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.126
I'm not sure either.

00:03:20.365 --> 00:03:22.196
This is so frustrating.

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:38.615
They told me to speak to you.

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:39.955
When are you leaving?

00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:43.584
Oh, this is a crime scene.

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:45.025
Please finish up and leave.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:47.955
What a total mess.

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:50.126
Ma'am.

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.166
Your sons killed a person.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:57.965
And your first son is dead.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:03:59.636
So what?

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:14.555
What on earth?

00:04:21.556 --> 00:04:24.495
What's up? You took so long,
so I started eating first.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:25.576
Should I order one for you?

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.395
No, I'm not hungry.

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:29.765
Why isn't he coming?

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.965
- Who? - The young priest.

00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:33.905
He asked to meet urgently.

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:35.306
Really?

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:39.446
- I better go before he comes.
- You're going? Why?

00:04:40.975 --> 00:04:42.975
I'm not fond of priests.

00:04:45.386 --> 00:04:46.446
Take this.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.515
I brought bandages, disinfectant,
and some other stuff.

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:51.224
You have to change your bandage often.

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:52.425
I know since I've been hurt often.

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:53.955
I've been hurt often too.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:57.441
Why don't you buy me some
meat instead of this?

00:04:57.465 --> 00:04:59.525
My energy is totally
drained from this case.

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:03.636
You complain about food
a lot since last time.

00:05:05.236 --> 00:05:06.436
Hey, wait.

00:05:07.876 --> 00:05:10.645
I can't drive my taxi for a
while, so I need to save money.

00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:13.145
I'm about to get fired from work.

00:05:15.215 --> 00:05:16.985
How's the case going?

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:18.546
Choi Min Gu will be indicted soon.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:21.696
His sentence will be reduced
due to insanity though.

00:05:22.515 --> 00:05:25.155
I've experienced all kinds of
stuff working as a detective.

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:28.926
But lately, I can't
believe what I'm seeing.

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:36.095
I know.

00:05:36.736 --> 00:05:38.656
I understand you saw such
things a few days ago.

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:43.176
And you must feel strange when you
come and eat at a dump like this.

00:05:45.506 --> 00:05:46.645
Park Il Do.

00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:50.655
That's the thing that
changes people like that?

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:53.556
Yes. Park Il Do.

00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:56.855
It penetrates into one's
darkest side and weakness...

00:05:57.025 --> 00:05:58.525
and takes over.

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:00.626
That's how Sohn comes.

00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:04.265
Is that why those brothers
hated women and killed them?

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:06.965
That hatred came from their mother's abuse.

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.605
Their mom...

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.905
didn't seem sad at all.

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.176
Who is worse? A devil like Park Il Do...

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:21.345
or their mom who caused
all of this to happen?

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.546
I'm not sure about that.

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:32.524
Seriously. Besides people
being possessed by spirits,

00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:34.696
there are plenty of bad
people on the streets anyway.

00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:36.765
Why are you chasing after Park Il Do?

00:06:37.426 --> 00:06:38.926
Someone has to stop it.

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:42.196
I also have a personal
issue to take care of.

00:06:48.506 --> 00:06:50.475
- Be careful then. - Thank you.

00:06:51.605 --> 00:06:53.816
- For what? - For saving my life.

00:06:54.376 --> 00:06:56.715
If you hadn't come at that
moment, I would've died.

00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:00.556
I know. I wanted to tell you this.

00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.225
You might really die if you do that again.

00:07:03.686 --> 00:07:06.525
- It's dangerous.
- Then you can help me again.

00:07:07.496 --> 00:07:09.495
And something's been bugging me lately.

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.325
Why do you keep speaking down to me?

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:12.525
You were a suspect.

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:14.535
I'm not anymore.

00:07:14.835 --> 00:07:16.095
How old are you?

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.676
You're just leaving?

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:34.855
Hello.

00:07:36.186 --> 00:07:37.355
Hwa Pyung is inside.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:40.796
Thank you...

00:07:45.326 --> 00:07:46.395
for the last time.

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:48.316
I didn't have the chance to thank you.

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:51.736
It's my job as a detective.
Don't worry about it.

00:07:58.105 --> 00:08:01.275
Have we ever met before?

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:05.046
- Last time at the shaman's house...
- No, before that.

00:08:06.446 --> 00:08:08.616
- Have you ever gone to church? - No.

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:10.785
I hate churches.

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:20.665
You're here.

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.236
You expect me to believe that?

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:30.645
The last person Park Il Do
possessed was Priest Choi.

00:08:31.275 --> 00:08:33.676
- Your brother. - How do you know that?

00:08:34.516 --> 00:08:35.816
Did you ever meet my brother?

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.345
A long time ago.

00:08:41.686 --> 00:08:42.686
Just once.

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:45.946
I can't tell you in
detail, but I'm certain.

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:48.296
My brother is the Park Il Do...

00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.375
that goes around killing people?

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:53.335
And it still kills people?

00:08:55.365 --> 00:08:56.805
It's not your brother now.

00:08:56.806 --> 00:08:58.635
- It's Park Il Do. - I can't believe you.

00:09:01.806 --> 00:09:04.345
You know your brother has been
possessed by a powerful spirit.

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:06.675
Isn't that why you became...

00:09:06.676 --> 00:09:08.375
an exorcist priest? To cure him?

00:09:08.946 --> 00:09:11.715
I'll pretend that I didn't
hear what you just said.

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:15.816
My brother is not Park Il Do.

00:09:16.286 --> 00:09:17.585
It said it would find you.

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:22.696
What do you mean?

00:09:24.865 --> 00:09:27.495
Kim Young Soo said that
when he was possessed.

00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:30.464
And that Priest Choi
will go to his brother.

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:31.465
Why do you think so?

00:09:31.566 --> 00:09:32.566
You're in danger.

00:09:32.635 --> 00:09:34.205
- So... - Forget it.

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:37.505
Don't ever come see me again.

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.115
I'm telling you it's really dangerous.

00:09:46.816 --> 00:09:48.354
He may look like your
brother, but don't be fooled.

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:49.926
He's not your brother. He's Park Il Do.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.526
Make sure to contact me if he comes to you!

00:10:51.816 --> 00:10:54.186
Are you really going to
stake out here all night?

00:10:55.485 --> 00:10:57.786
That priest is at the
church during the day.

00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:00.426
I'm sure he'll come here at night.

00:11:01.526 --> 00:11:03.766
How can you trust something a ghost said?

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:06.066
He's not coming.

00:11:06.296 --> 00:11:08.735
It's a ghost's hobby to fool humans.

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:11.766
This is so boring.

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:14.005
I'm sick of this guy.

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:17.946
Then go home.

00:11:18.646 --> 00:11:21.646
A man should be loyal.

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:23.445
I'm a real man.

00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:26.085
I can't let you suffer alone
while I go home to sleep.

00:11:26.446 --> 00:11:28.485
That's ridiculous. That startled me.

00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:34.026
Hello? Yes.

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:38.725
You just closed the shop?

00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:40.166
Right now?

00:11:42.965 --> 00:11:44.005
I'll be right there.

00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:47.975
"The shop"?

00:11:48.705 --> 00:11:49.906
What shop?

00:11:50.446 --> 00:11:52.005
It's someone who runs a shop.

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:55.516
Isn't she the owner of
that bar you always go to?

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:56.845
Are you two dating?

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:59.075
Do you know how old I am?
What do you mean, date?

00:12:02.816 --> 00:12:04.585
She's single too.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.026
I've never been married.

00:12:09.526 --> 00:12:12.166
She's trying to carry in
something ridiculously heavy.

00:12:12.526 --> 00:12:13.965
She has a bad back too.

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:17.266
All right, just go. Go. You can go.

00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:20.036
Fine, I'm leaving.

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:22.004
You should go home too.

00:12:22.005 --> 00:12:24.105
He's not going to come tonight.

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:28.046
By the way,

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:30.546
what if he comes while I'm not here?

00:12:31.146 --> 00:12:33.907
Do you think the priest will be able
to perform an exorcism properly?

00:12:34.385 --> 00:12:35.455
It's his own brother.

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:38.385
We'll try.

00:12:40.296 --> 00:12:42.755
- If it doesn't work... - Then, what?

00:12:45.796 --> 00:12:47.766
Don't tell me...

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:50.864
Hey, don't tell me...

00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:53.234
Stop that. Seriously.

00:12:53.235 --> 00:12:55.375
Stop making a ruckus and go while you can.

00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:58.046
Why would you get mad?

00:12:58.576 --> 00:12:59.705
All right.

00:13:00.516 --> 00:13:02.776
This is my car, but you're kicking me out.

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:04.316
Bye.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:19.936
Hey!

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:21.834
No! Please!

00:13:21.835 --> 00:13:24.306
No! No!

00:13:27.406 --> 00:13:28.536
If it doesn't work...

00:13:41.385 --> 00:13:42.385
We're almost there.

00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:46.826
We're almost there.

00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:04.005
- Yes, Father Yang. - It's been a while.

00:15:05.835 --> 00:15:07.805
I didn't want to call you for
something like this, but...

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:08.975
What is it?

00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:20.715
Gosh.

00:15:22.115 --> 00:15:23.985
Why is it suddenly pouring so much?

00:15:24.855 --> 00:15:26.155
Where are you going so
early in the morning?

00:15:26.156 --> 00:15:27.255
I got it.

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:34.166
What is it? Did something happen?

00:15:37.505 --> 00:15:38.635
They found it.

00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:40.576
Found what?

00:15:42.135 --> 00:15:43.875
They found him on a small hill...

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:46.276
behind our childhood town.

00:16:04.995 --> 00:16:06.835
They found the body of my brother.

00:16:47.936 --> 00:16:50.105
Stop, you can't enter here.

00:16:51.046 --> 00:16:54.374
Hey, is the body you found that priest's?

00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:55.415
The one from the case 20 years ago.

00:16:55.416 --> 00:16:57.546
I can't answer that. Please leave.

00:16:57.646 --> 00:16:59.885
When did he die? Was it recent?

00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:01.615
Which press are you with?

00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.255
You'll find out later.

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:06.996
That's enough.

00:17:10.695 --> 00:17:15.466
The priest is on his way to...

00:17:16.095 --> 00:17:21.236
his little brother!

00:17:22.405 --> 00:17:24.706
His teeth conditions
match Choi Sang Hyun's.

00:17:44.726 --> 00:17:45.826
It was suicide?

00:17:52.165 --> 00:17:53.976
His spine broke off at the neck,

00:17:54.175 --> 00:17:55.935
and they even found a rope.

00:17:58.175 --> 00:18:00.095
They couldn't find any
other wounds on the body.

00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:03.144
That's why they think...

00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:04.786
he committed suicide by hanging himself.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:10.286
It's what many possessed
people end up doing.

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.256
It's strange.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.425
He was found buried in the ground.

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:25.905
Exactly.

00:18:26.036 --> 00:18:29.104
At first, I thought the
bones belonged an animal,

00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:31.105
then I saw human clothes.

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:33.145
All of my hairs rose up.

00:18:33.915 --> 00:18:36.415
He was buried in the ground?
Are you sure about this?

00:18:37.345 --> 00:18:39.986
The police told me not
to talk to reporters.

00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:41.385
I'm not a reporter.

00:18:41.885 --> 00:18:44.985
I came to visit my grandpa,

00:18:44.986 --> 00:18:48.125
then I heard about this corpse.
Of course I'm curious.

00:18:49.056 --> 00:18:50.125
Are you curious?

00:18:56.195 --> 00:18:57.206
It's 20 dollars.

00:18:57.905 --> 00:18:58.935
They're delicious.

00:18:59.536 --> 00:19:00.875
Gosh.

00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.604
I got it, I got it.

00:19:03.605 --> 00:19:05.604
I wonder why the body was
only discovered now...

00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:07.525
after it was buried in the
hill for a long time.

00:19:07.675 --> 00:19:10.845
It's a rarely traveled path.

00:19:11.246 --> 00:19:13.515
I don't know why I took that path myself.

00:19:13.516 --> 00:19:15.085
Maybe a ghost lured me in.

00:19:15.556 --> 00:19:17.185
It's been raining a lot here recently.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.855
The rain washed down the soil
and the corpse came out.

00:19:20.395 --> 00:19:22.901
Did you hear anything else from the
police about the investigation?

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.525
What is it that you're so curious about?

00:19:25.226 --> 00:19:27.066
Ask the police yourself.

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:31.766
Fine.

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:39.206
Stay away from every
case for the time being.

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:42.545
You are lucky you didn't get suspended...

00:19:42.546 --> 00:19:43.746
by the disciplinary committee.

00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:46.085
I don't want to.

00:19:47.615 --> 00:19:48.885
Why do I have to?

00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:51.026
What?

00:19:53.925 --> 00:19:56.194
Two suspects got injured in a row.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:57.226
Besides,

00:19:57.766 --> 00:20:00.486
the handcuffed culprit was left alone
in the car and killed himself.

00:20:01.566 --> 00:20:03.404
You tried to deal with the culprit alone...

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:04.865
and let him die.

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:08.252
You don't even follow the
basic rules of investigation.

00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:09.875
- Sir. - What?

00:20:10.806 --> 00:20:14.216
Thanks to Detective Kang,
everything worked out.

00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:16.344
The culprit hurt himself because I...

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:17.844
I don't like you either.

00:20:17.845 --> 00:20:20.816
You always cut her slack and spoiled her.

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:23.316
We got the result from the
forensic investigation.

00:20:24.855 --> 00:20:26.624
I told you many times...

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.155
not to work alone.

00:20:28.256 --> 00:20:30.136
I told you to be more
cooperative for the team.

00:20:31.026 --> 00:20:33.334
It's always you. You're the fault.

00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:34.435
It's because of you.

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.395
Hey, Kang Gil Young. Where are you going?

00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:37.934
Kang Gil Young!

00:20:37.935 --> 00:20:39.604
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:20:39.605 --> 00:20:41.135
I'll talk to her.

00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:52.845
- Hello. - It's me.

00:20:53.716 --> 00:20:54.816
How have you been?

00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:59.726
I thought I should talk to you.

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.296
I feel sorry for you.

00:21:12.236 --> 00:21:13.335
She has arrived.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:17.405
Hello?

00:21:17.845 --> 00:21:20.115
Gil Young, are you listening?

00:21:20.576 --> 00:21:23.445
Yes, I will come to you.

00:21:31.155 --> 00:21:33.275
It's under investigation.
There's nothing we can say.

00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:34.595
Do you understand?

00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:42.095
Hello.

00:21:42.665 --> 00:21:43.665
Hi.

00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:49.135
Mrs. Park.

00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:50.345
Oh, my.

00:21:50.945 --> 00:21:52.746
Father, what are you doing here?

00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:55.445
I'm here for work. What brings you here?

00:21:55.645 --> 00:21:58.546
I was invited by someone.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:03.256
I heard Sharing Hands is
going well thanks to you.

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.584
The students said many
nice things about you.

00:22:05.585 --> 00:22:06.654
You're flattering me.

00:22:06.655 --> 00:22:09.124
- How is the fund-raising going?
- It's going well.

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:10.566
I'll work hard as well.

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:12.726
See you later.

00:22:15.835 --> 00:22:16.935
Hello.

00:22:28.675 --> 00:22:29.716
Who is she?

00:22:31.816 --> 00:22:33.486
She's Park Hong Joo, a politician.

00:22:34.316 --> 00:22:35.786
You don't know that famous woman?

00:22:36.185 --> 00:22:39.065
Although you're a priest, you should
know what's happening in the world.

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:41.026
How do you know her?

00:22:42.026 --> 00:22:45.195
I run a voluntary organisation
called, Sharing Hands...

00:22:45.526 --> 00:22:47.206
and she's the advisor of the organisation.

00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:50.706
She's a nice person.

00:22:55.605 --> 00:22:58.175
Thank you for making time to visit me.

00:22:58.976 --> 00:23:01.175
Of course I care about my hometown.

00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:03.885
I came for the school council...

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:05.746
and I heard the news. It surprised me.

00:23:06.046 --> 00:23:08.316
So the body of the murderer was found?

00:23:08.516 --> 00:23:10.685
Oh, that case.

00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.256
Yes.

00:23:15.296 --> 00:23:16.536
How is the investigation going?

00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:19.442
According to the research so far,
it's very likely it was a suicide.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:22.796
But the corpse is very old.

00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:24.266
We need more investigation.

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.335
Maybe there's a chance that he got killed.

00:23:28.135 --> 00:23:30.045
Don't do that.

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:34.076
- Pardon? - Stop investigating that case.

00:23:35.316 --> 00:23:36.914
If the press talks about it,

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:38.585
it'll tarnish this region's reputation.

00:23:39.746 --> 00:23:40.816
But...

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:44.226
it was a very famous case in the past...

00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:47.355
- and the press... - I told you not to!

00:23:54.635 --> 00:23:55.736
Get out. All of you.

00:23:57.865 --> 00:24:00.135
Get out!

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:12.046
Just cover it up.

00:24:13.956 --> 00:24:14.986
You know me, don't you?

00:24:17.385 --> 00:24:19.655
Think about who let you make this far.

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:23.665
It's all thanks to my family, you jerk.

00:24:25.226 --> 00:24:26.296
Yes.

00:24:27.036 --> 00:24:28.135
I understand.

00:24:45.042 --> 00:24:46.282
So...

00:24:47.082 --> 00:24:50.180
why do you use my car as if it's yours?

00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:51.301
So when are you coming back?

00:24:51.582 --> 00:24:53.792
I don't know. I'm still investigating.

00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:55.451
Are you okay?

00:24:55.992 --> 00:24:57.461
Of course I'm not.

00:24:57.822 --> 00:25:00.161
I've been thinking Priest
Choi was Park Il Do.

00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:03.461
I've been looking for him
for the past few years.

00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.572
I've been only asking around about him.

00:25:07.002 --> 00:25:08.971
I've done all those for nothing.

00:25:09.272 --> 00:25:11.742
We didn't know he was dead.

00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:15.470
By the way, who did the superior spirit

00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:18.282
Park Il Do possess?

00:25:18.782 --> 00:25:20.451
Do you have any idea who it could be?

00:25:20.612 --> 00:25:21.681
I don't know.

00:25:22.512 --> 00:25:25.481
It must have transferred to
someone before Priest Choi died.

00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:29.292
Now I should look for the
last person he talked to.

00:25:42.502 --> 00:25:44.802
Don't you know the incident
from 20 years ago?

00:25:45.102 --> 00:25:47.470
They found the culprit's body.

00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:49.881
Of course I do. It horrified me.

00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:53.181
I heard that's because
his parents abused him.

00:25:53.282 --> 00:25:56.282
That's not it. The culprit
is a crazy person.

00:25:56.512 --> 00:25:58.851
Oh, right. That too.

00:25:58.852 --> 00:25:59.852
Why won't you eat?

00:25:59.853 --> 00:26:02.920
Still, they are his parents.

00:26:02.921 --> 00:26:04.992
How could he kill his parents like that?

00:26:06.322 --> 00:26:07.391
I heard he was a priest.

00:26:07.961 --> 00:26:09.460
He's not a priest.

00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:12.532
I heard the whole family was
into some kind of a cult.

00:26:15.602 --> 00:26:16.842
Shall we go?

00:26:20.411 --> 00:26:22.441
I'm used to hearing this.

00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:29.551
I'd like to order a bottle of soju.

00:26:29.812 --> 00:26:30.822
Okay.

00:26:31.921 --> 00:26:33.161
Are you going to drink alcohol?

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:34.792
Well.

00:26:36.592 --> 00:26:38.161
I need to drink some alcohol now.

00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:41.231
Here you are.

00:27:04.481 --> 00:27:05.822
Father, are you okay?

00:27:06.852 --> 00:27:07.852
I'm okay.

00:27:10.822 --> 00:27:12.661
Do you think you'll be fine alone?

00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:16.961
I'll be fine. You have some time
until the bus departs, right?

00:27:18.862 --> 00:27:20.930
About 10 minutes. Why?

00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:22.291
I want to ask you about something.

00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:25.401
Something you haven't told me yet.

00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:28.871
You can tell me now.

00:27:30.112 --> 00:27:32.312
Why did a sincere believer,
Sang Hyun, got possessed...

00:27:33.881 --> 00:27:35.252
and killed his family?

00:27:36.582 --> 00:27:38.681
What was the hole in his heart?

00:27:39.822 --> 00:27:41.592
Your brother wasn't sincere.

00:27:42.492 --> 00:27:43.792
Your parents were.

00:27:44.691 --> 00:27:46.992
Your brother didn't want to be a priest.

00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:48.961
So he hated his parents?

00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:53.572
He must have been unhappy and regretful.

00:27:54.701 --> 00:27:57.072
Demons use such emotions as well.

00:27:58.842 --> 00:28:00.171
There's one thing I'm sure of.

00:28:02.042 --> 00:28:03.842
He loved his family more than anyone.

00:28:04.881 --> 00:28:05.941
Especially...

00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:11.151
his younger brother.

00:28:14.992 --> 00:28:16.691
I'm sorry.

00:28:20.691 --> 00:28:22.762
I shouldn't have brought
him there that day.

00:28:23.661 --> 00:28:25.901
If only I had realized he was possessed.

00:28:28.272 --> 00:28:29.471
I want to hear about...

00:28:30.471 --> 00:28:31.802
the day he got possessed.

00:28:32.641 --> 00:28:34.312
- It's all in the past. - I must know.

00:28:35.012 --> 00:28:36.012
What happened...

00:28:36.812 --> 00:28:38.012
on that day?

00:28:46.322 --> 00:28:48.951
I received a call that a kid
was possessed by a spirit.

00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.721
I went to perform an exorcism.

00:28:53.062 --> 00:28:54.542
Your brother was my assistant priest.

00:28:56.961 --> 00:28:58.102
Who was that kid?

00:28:58.532 --> 00:29:00.130
It was a boy from...

00:29:00.131 --> 00:29:02.032
a hereditary shaman family.

00:29:02.302 --> 00:29:04.971
He was possessed by a spirit
that existed in that village.

00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:09.981
The name of that spirit was Park Il Do.

00:29:12.742 --> 00:29:14.112
Did you say Park Il Do?

00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:15.782
That boy...

00:29:16.481 --> 00:29:18.252
came to see me recently.

00:29:19.992 --> 00:29:21.221
He was looking for you.

00:29:23.022 --> 00:29:24.982
He said he heard a prophecy
from a possessed man.

00:29:27.592 --> 00:29:30.832
That your brother will
come looking for you.

00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:38.002
What is...

00:29:41.141 --> 00:29:42.272
that boy's name?

00:29:46.042 --> 00:29:47.812
Yes, okay.

00:29:51.082 --> 00:29:52.551
Here we go.

00:29:52.552 --> 00:29:54.451
Grandpa, look at this beef!

00:29:55.252 --> 00:29:57.322
Let's fill our stomachs
with some beef tonight.

00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:00.690
How long is your holiday?

00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:01.862
Why aren't you going home?

00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:06.102
Since it's my holiday.
I have plenty of time.

00:30:06.532 --> 00:30:10.571
I received a call just now
from Mr. Kim in our village.

00:30:10.572 --> 00:30:12.102
He said he saw you in another village.

00:30:12.502 --> 00:30:14.772
Are you going around
asking about that priest?

00:30:14.971 --> 00:30:17.511
What are you talking about?
Has that old man gone mad?

00:30:17.512 --> 00:30:18.782
- Mad? - Come on!

00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:21.911
- Have you gone mad too? - Yes, I have!

00:30:22.252 --> 00:30:25.451
I told you not to go
near that neighborhood.

00:30:25.752 --> 00:30:29.190
Are you still chasing after
that spirit or whatever?

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:30.690
It's none of your business.

00:30:30.691 --> 00:30:32.021
- What? - Please.

00:30:32.022 --> 00:30:33.730
You always overturn a
table when you're angry.

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:35.562
- Yes, I'm furious! - Please, stop.

00:30:37.201 --> 00:30:39.302
- My back hurts. - Are you okay?

00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:42.502
That temper of yours doesn't change.

00:30:43.242 --> 00:30:44.440
Where's the pain relief patch?

00:30:44.441 --> 00:30:48.072
Listen. You better mark my words.

00:30:48.812 --> 00:30:51.782
Don't ever go near that spirit, Park Il Do.

00:30:52.112 --> 00:30:53.451
Don't even think about it.

00:30:54.612 --> 00:30:56.211
I have to catch Park Il Do.

00:30:56.782 --> 00:30:59.420
- It still possesses people...
- I don't care.

00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:01.891
What if it gets back at you?

00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:04.761
What will you do if it possesses you again?

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:07.292
It won't. I was young back then.

00:31:07.862 --> 00:31:10.231
And you sent me far away.

00:31:10.332 --> 00:31:12.431
To some relatives that I didn't even know.

00:31:14.631 --> 00:31:15.701
That was because...

00:31:16.772 --> 00:31:18.602
I was afraid it might find you.

00:31:19.602 --> 00:31:21.362
Anyway, stop what you're
doing this instant.

00:31:22.671 --> 00:31:24.381
Whatever. I'll take care of it.

00:31:25.312 --> 00:31:27.211
You little idiot!

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:31.881
Goodness.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:39.121
I told you to stop this instant!

00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:41.391
Do you want to see me die?

00:33:35.711 --> 00:33:36.941
There's one thing I'm sure of.

00:33:38.881 --> 00:33:40.911
He loved his family more than anyone.

00:33:40.912 --> 00:33:41.981
Especially...

00:33:43.052 --> 00:33:44.952
his younger brother.

00:33:57.762 --> 00:33:58.831
Was it you?

00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.211
What are you doing here?

00:34:07.742 --> 00:34:09.612
I was suspicious of your brother's death.

00:34:11.112 --> 00:34:13.393
I came at night because the
cops are here during the day.

00:34:17.282 --> 00:34:18.622
You knew everything.

00:34:21.892 --> 00:34:23.291
You knew everything!

00:34:24.191 --> 00:34:25.762
But you told me about my brother...

00:34:26.322 --> 00:34:27.631
to find Park Il Do?

00:34:29.762 --> 00:34:31.678
The reason why he was possessed
in the first place...

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:33.202
was because of you!

00:34:38.472 --> 00:34:39.472
You're right.

00:34:41.472 --> 00:34:44.012
It was because of me.

00:34:45.581 --> 00:34:46.981
I understand if you blame me.

00:34:57.191 --> 00:34:58.711
Both of you, cut it out and follow me.

00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:02.231
Before I call the police for
trespassing a crime scene.

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:16.071
Why are you here? It's not
even your jurisdiction.

00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:17.142
Shut it.

00:35:17.912 --> 00:35:19.112
Don't say a word.

00:35:43.302 --> 00:35:44.401
Why did we come here?

00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:47.311
20 years ago,

00:35:48.572 --> 00:35:50.811
a family was murdered here.

00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:53.552
A female detective was
passing by at that moment...

00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:57.021
and saved a son of the family,
who was the last survivor.

00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:00.151
But she died at the scene.

00:36:09.932 --> 00:36:12.762
That crazy murderer who killed
that family and the detective...

00:36:14.302 --> 00:36:15.472
is your brother, right?

00:36:18.972 --> 00:36:20.271
What is your point?

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:22.412
The female detective who died...

00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:27.081
was my mom.

00:36:31.952 --> 00:36:33.052
Run away!

00:36:38.691 --> 00:36:39.691
Mom!

00:36:41.662 --> 00:36:43.862
Mom! No, mom!

00:36:44.561 --> 00:36:46.932
Mom, no! Please...

00:36:47.202 --> 00:36:49.101
Mom!

00:36:58.342 --> 00:37:00.182
She died trying to save you.

00:37:01.612 --> 00:37:03.480
Your brother vanished and
it became an unsolved case.

00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:05.321
I've been living in pain
every day since then.

00:37:06.251 --> 00:37:08.921
I can't forget that moment when
my mom walked into that house.

00:37:11.961 --> 00:37:13.191
I wanted to catch him.

00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:18.311
I became a detective to catch
him with my own hands.

00:37:19.762 --> 00:37:20.831
But...

00:37:22.202 --> 00:37:24.072
I didn't know he was this close by.

00:37:25.072 --> 00:37:26.642
And he died 20 years ago...

00:37:32.811 --> 00:37:34.512
I wanted to catch him with my own hands.

00:37:37.552 --> 00:37:38.981
Priest Choi isn't the culprit.

00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:43.492
What?

00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:46.762
Priest Choi was...

00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:50.731
possessed by Park Il Do back then.

00:37:53.401 --> 00:37:54.831
You crazy jerk.

00:37:55.631 --> 00:37:57.901
- Is it Park Il Do again? - I told you.

00:37:58.401 --> 00:38:00.412
I was possessed by Park Il Do before.

00:38:02.242 --> 00:38:04.742
The priest who tried to
exorcize me was Priest Choi.

00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:08.211
He tried to save me...

00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:12.851
and Park Il Do moved into his body instead.

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:15.452
It wasn't Priest Choi.

00:38:16.452 --> 00:38:18.460
It was the Park Il Do
that used to possess me.

00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:19.461
Stop it.

00:38:20.262 --> 00:38:22.762
I don't want to hear anything
about that darned spirit.

00:38:22.892 --> 00:38:23.901
That night,

00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:26.871
I came to this house to meet Priest Choi.

00:38:26.872 --> 00:38:27.872
But...

00:38:29.131 --> 00:38:31.400
I sensed that something terrible
happened here, but I couldn't go in.

00:38:31.401 --> 00:38:32.601
And I was just standing there.

00:38:33.642 --> 00:38:36.041
Then, a woman passing by saw me.

00:38:36.342 --> 00:38:38.822
She stopped the car because she
thought I was an abused child.

00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:40.311
She wanted to help me.

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:52.421
That child...

00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:56.032
was you?

00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:58.032
Was it you?

00:39:02.231 --> 00:39:04.101
Yes. That was me.

00:39:06.072 --> 00:39:07.872
She went into that house because of me.

00:39:53.651 --> 00:39:55.121
Good for you.

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:57.460
I told you to go home
right away after school,

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.698
but you ran off to your friend's
to play without calling me?

00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:00.992
You made me worry.

00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:07.331
Kang Gil Young, answer me.

00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:10.901
Are you mad at me?

00:40:12.472 --> 00:40:13.512
Well?

00:40:20.012 --> 00:40:23.012
Fine. I'm sorry.

00:40:23.722 --> 00:40:27.892
I told you I've been busy with
the missing teenage girl case.

00:40:28.222 --> 00:40:31.822
I didn't forget your birthday. I mean it.

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:36.131
Gosh. My goodness.

00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:38.421
Are you going to keep ignoring me?

00:40:39.432 --> 00:40:40.601
Are you serious?

00:40:41.601 --> 00:40:43.771
You know you take after me.

00:40:43.872 --> 00:40:46.041
At this rate, we'll never
speak to each other again.

00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:50.981
All right, I'm sorry.

00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:54.912
Gosh.

00:40:58.782 --> 00:40:59.851
What is this?

00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:09.092
Hey. What are you doing over there?

00:41:17.941 --> 00:41:19.001
What is he doing?

00:41:23.541 --> 00:41:25.540
No, I'm not taking a detour.

00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:26.811
It'll only take me a minute.

00:41:28.112 --> 00:41:30.182
Let's go eat something nice after this.

00:41:30.322 --> 00:41:32.921
I didn't get to eat while working.
I'm hungry too.

00:41:33.421 --> 00:41:35.291
How about jjajangmyeon? Tangsuyuk?

00:41:59.682 --> 00:42:00.882
Stay in the car. I'll be back.

00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:04.251
Aren't you going to talk to me?

00:42:43.892 --> 00:42:46.361
You should go home after
visiting your hometown.

00:42:46.362 --> 00:42:48.002
Why did you crawl back here at this hour?

00:42:49.592 --> 00:42:51.731
I'm really hungry. Can I have this?

00:42:52.061 --> 00:42:53.230
I thought you didn't eat jjajangmyeon.

00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:54.572
That's for Detective Shin.

00:42:56.572 --> 00:42:59.302
The best jjajangmyeon is the one
you eat while working all night.

00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:01.462
Why did you go back to
your hometown anyway?

00:43:01.541 --> 00:43:02.572
Did something happen?

00:43:05.142 --> 00:43:06.181
I found him.

00:43:06.182 --> 00:43:08.311
Found who? Your first love?

00:43:11.182 --> 00:43:12.182
Your mom?

00:43:13.651 --> 00:43:15.491
Did you catch the culprit
who killed your mom?

00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:16.892
Yes.

00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:20.291
But he was already dead.

00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:24.861
Get up. I'll buy you drinks. Let's go.

00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:26.400
We can't drink on duty.

00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:28.072
That's not important right now.

00:43:28.331 --> 00:43:29.671
Get up.

00:43:31.872 --> 00:43:32.972
Are you not going to go?

00:43:34.441 --> 00:43:36.211
You're so stubborn.

00:43:36.682 --> 00:43:37.711
Gosh.

00:43:38.881 --> 00:43:39.952
You're right.

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:43.282
I'm ridiculously stubborn.

00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:47.521
A birthday isn't such a big deal.

00:43:49.151 --> 00:43:50.722
I didn't say a word...

00:43:51.691 --> 00:43:53.021
when she apologized so much.

00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:56.601
Gil Young.

00:43:58.432 --> 00:43:59.831
Had I gone...

00:44:00.331 --> 00:44:02.501
straight home that day after school,

00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:07.941
Mom would've never had to pick me up.

00:44:09.472 --> 00:44:11.541
Then we wouldn't have
passed that house either.

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:15.981
I was acting so stubborn.

00:44:19.682 --> 00:44:22.251
She told me she didn't even eat.

00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:10.771
It's all my fault.

00:45:13.642 --> 00:45:15.211
Why are you still up?

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:18.782
I hear people can't sleep
when they get old.

00:45:19.642 --> 00:45:21.311
No, they can't.

00:45:22.751 --> 00:45:25.381
I can't sleep.

00:45:26.892 --> 00:45:28.191
Ever since that day,

00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:33.331
I'm reminded of that time...

00:45:33.662 --> 00:45:35.532
whenever I close my eyes.

00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.362
It's a grudge.

00:45:39.202 --> 00:45:40.472
Was there...

00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:44.401
anything I could've done?

00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:47.671
Why couldn't I stop it?

00:45:48.342 --> 00:45:51.941
Your mother was young.
She had a bright future.

00:45:52.981 --> 00:45:55.612
It should've been me who died.

00:45:56.682 --> 00:46:00.151
Enough nonsense. Just go to sleep.

00:46:01.052 --> 00:46:04.162
If you don't sleep properly,
you will get dementia.

00:46:05.822 --> 00:46:06.992
Don't give me trouble...

00:46:07.892 --> 00:46:09.862
during your last years.

00:46:11.932 --> 00:46:14.731
Don't you worry about me.

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:18.101
You should forget about everything...

00:46:19.302 --> 00:46:21.311
and live your own life.

00:46:22.972 --> 00:46:26.142
It's not like the dead can come back.

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:32.251
You know very well what he's like.

00:46:32.921 --> 00:46:34.651
I know it very well too.

00:46:36.492 --> 00:46:37.921
If something happens to you...

00:46:39.322 --> 00:46:40.892
while you're trying to find him,

00:46:42.492 --> 00:46:46.262
I'll kill myself too.

00:46:49.941 --> 00:46:52.572
The only attachment I have now...

00:46:53.572 --> 00:46:56.881
is you.

00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:25.271
What are you doing here?

00:47:26.811 --> 00:47:27.842
Hey.

00:47:28.642 --> 00:47:30.642
I thought I should see him off.

00:47:51.961 --> 00:47:53.872
Are you sure you'll be
okay with cremating him?

00:47:54.501 --> 00:47:56.271
Nothing has been proved.

00:47:57.041 --> 00:47:59.342
The police already closed
the case as a suicide.

00:48:00.912 --> 00:48:03.311
Isn't anyone coming? Maybe your relatives?

00:48:03.512 --> 00:48:05.342
They think he's a murderer.

00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:09.981
I knew that he was possessed,

00:48:12.722 --> 00:48:14.521
but I always blamed him, hated him,

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:17.061
and was scared of him.

00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:21.592
But you became an exorcist priest...

00:48:22.362 --> 00:48:23.862
in order to find your brother.

00:48:23.961 --> 00:48:25.061
I did.

00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:28.372
But I didn't know he was already dead.

00:48:30.142 --> 00:48:32.062
It might have been better
for my brother to die.

00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:33.941
Even if the exorcism had gone well,

00:48:35.472 --> 00:48:37.381
he wouldn't have stayed sane.

00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:40.052
A priest who killed his parents.

00:48:42.412 --> 00:48:43.481
Park Il Do.

00:48:44.881 --> 00:48:47.322
The demon killed my parents...

00:48:48.822 --> 00:48:51.182
and possessed my brother. That's
what you're saying, right?

00:48:55.691 --> 00:48:57.101
Speaking of which,

00:48:59.862 --> 00:49:01.702
what should I do...

00:49:04.872 --> 00:49:06.202
to find that Park Il Do?

00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:18.912
Once you start this, you won't be
able to go back to the normal life.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.851
Are you okay with that?

00:49:22.851 --> 00:49:24.222
It might take your whole life.

00:50:33.192 --> 00:50:35.993
What do you want me to do?

00:50:36.092 --> 00:50:38.362
Kill. Kill.

00:50:38.763 --> 00:50:39.793
Kill?

00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:42.692
Don't hold it back. Kill everyone.

00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:45.802
Kill everyone?

00:50:46.802 --> 00:50:47.933
Those people?

00:50:57.782 --> 00:50:59.612
- Thank you. - Thank you.

00:51:00.353 --> 00:51:01.512
Come with us.

00:51:01.513 --> 00:51:02.513
- We should go for another round.
- Let's drink some more.

00:51:02.514 --> 00:51:04.981
- No, thanks.
- Come on. Just one more drink.

00:51:04.982 --> 00:51:06.922
- Just one more drink.
- My wife won't like it.

00:51:07.252 --> 00:51:08.651
Let's drink one more glass.

00:51:08.652 --> 00:51:11.361
I drank alcohol yesterday and today.

00:51:11.362 --> 00:51:12.762
I will drink some tomorrow as well.

00:51:15.362 --> 00:51:17.461
- Have a safe trip home.
- Thank you. See you.

00:51:17.462 --> 00:51:18.902
- Good night. - Bye.

00:52:43.523 --> 00:52:45.921
We haven't met for a long time.
Let's have one more drink.

00:52:45.922 --> 00:52:48.892
Fine. By the way, is this the right way?

00:52:48.893 --> 00:52:51.562
It is. Just trust me and follow me.

00:52:51.563 --> 00:52:53.023
Just trust me.

00:52:54.632 --> 00:52:56.632
- What was that? - Darn it.

00:53:01.302 --> 00:53:02.302
Goodness.

00:53:13.043 --> 00:53:14.683
There's a bloodstain.

00:53:15.183 --> 00:53:17.282
Someone walked out of here while bleeding.

00:53:18.623 --> 00:53:20.143
Maybe someone dragged this person out.

00:53:20.252 --> 00:53:22.792
It seems to be quickly wiped. The
stain is smudged everywhere.

00:53:22.793 --> 00:53:23.793
The culprit wiped the blood.

00:53:23.794 --> 00:53:25.639
Does that mean he or she
intended to kidnap the victim?

00:53:25.663 --> 00:53:27.691
There are no signs of break-in.

00:53:27.692 --> 00:53:29.062
There's no blood scattered on the wall,

00:53:29.063 --> 00:53:30.432
which means there was no resistance.

00:53:30.433 --> 00:53:32.313
Maybe the culprit is the
victim's acquaintance.

00:53:32.402 --> 00:53:34.632
We don't know if this is a
murder case or not yet.

00:53:34.933 --> 00:53:36.103
There's no corpse.

00:53:38.273 --> 00:53:39.603
Kang Jong Ryul.

00:53:40.442 --> 00:53:42.273
27 years old, an office worker.

00:53:43.183 --> 00:53:44.782
What in the world happened?

00:54:03.333 --> 00:54:04.402
Here's his picture.

00:54:05.302 --> 00:54:06.872
He looks normal.

00:54:06.873 --> 00:54:09.572
You said he had a girlfriend, right?

00:54:12.373 --> 00:54:14.373
His family said...

00:54:14.672 --> 00:54:17.543
they couldn't reach him for over a week.
Weren't you worried?

00:54:18.882 --> 00:54:20.252
We broke up.

00:54:21.212 --> 00:54:22.313
When?

00:54:23.052 --> 00:54:25.482
About a month ago.

00:54:26.523 --> 00:54:30.092
Wait, no. I think it's
been about two months.

00:54:31.663 --> 00:54:34.763
When is the last time you talked to him?

00:54:34.962 --> 00:54:36.362
When we broke up.

00:54:36.902 --> 00:54:37.933
We haven't talked since.

00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:41.702
I'm sorry for asking, but could
you tell me why you broke up?

00:54:41.703 --> 00:54:42.932
What happened?

00:54:42.933 --> 00:54:45.973
Nothing happened. Nothing.

00:54:50.212 --> 00:54:52.913
Do you have any idea...

00:54:53.183 --> 00:54:56.111
what he would have been doing for a week...

00:54:56.112 --> 00:54:57.481
after the break-up?

00:54:57.482 --> 00:54:59.152
Maybe he could have a fight with someone?

00:55:02.853 --> 00:55:04.293
I don't know.

00:55:06.532 --> 00:55:08.532
I don't know anything.

00:55:09.232 --> 00:55:10.603
All right.

00:55:23.183 --> 00:55:24.243
Isn't that woman...

00:55:24.882 --> 00:55:26.212
a little strange?

00:55:26.453 --> 00:55:28.352
Her ex-boyfriend went missing.

00:55:28.353 --> 00:55:29.751
She must be confused.

00:55:29.752 --> 00:55:31.252
That's not what I mean.

00:55:31.353 --> 00:55:33.652
It feels like she's hiding something.

00:55:36.223 --> 00:55:37.293
What is it?

00:55:38.592 --> 00:55:41.862
My wife packed some side dishes for you.

00:55:42.362 --> 00:55:44.933
Most of them are made
of meat like jangjorim.

00:55:46.933 --> 00:55:48.872
I still haven't finished
the one from last time.

00:55:48.873 --> 00:55:50.441
You should have stopped her.

00:55:50.442 --> 00:55:52.572
Actually, I asked her to do it.

00:55:52.942 --> 00:55:54.312
Since you visited your hometown,

00:55:54.313 --> 00:55:56.112
you look so down.

00:55:56.342 --> 00:55:58.611
I thought you'd be better
once you're back to work,

00:55:58.612 --> 00:56:01.251
but you're still depressed.
It's not like you.

00:56:01.252 --> 00:56:03.523
You make me depressed too.

00:56:16.902 --> 00:56:18.002
She's possessed?

00:56:18.302 --> 00:56:20.703
She insists she has the symptoms.

00:56:21.532 --> 00:56:23.342
We don't have Father Han anymore.

00:56:23.543 --> 00:56:25.973
You're the only priest we have now.

00:56:26.672 --> 00:56:28.013
It's the bishop's wish as well.

00:56:28.672 --> 00:56:29.743
Okay.

00:56:30.112 --> 00:56:31.342
Let me meet her.

00:56:51.532 --> 00:56:53.433
What symptoms do you have?

00:56:58.172 --> 00:56:59.273
I...

00:57:01.313 --> 00:57:03.243
I feel like I'm not myself.

00:57:04.482 --> 00:57:05.882
Could you be more specific?

00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:10.652
It started...

00:57:11.853 --> 00:57:14.752
since I quit my job.

00:57:18.623 --> 00:57:19.793
When the light was off,

00:57:22.893 --> 00:57:26.532
I felt like someone was
watching me in the darkness.

00:57:27.933 --> 00:57:28.933
Day...

00:57:29.842 --> 00:57:31.203
and night,

00:57:32.203 --> 00:57:33.373
and wherever I go.

00:57:35.543 --> 00:57:36.782
Are there any other symptoms?

00:57:42.152 --> 00:57:44.453
I don't remember what I did.

00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:48.223
I'm standing in the middle
of an unfamiliar street.

00:57:49.252 --> 00:57:52.592
Do you see things and have hallucinations?

00:57:54.532 --> 00:57:55.862
I receive text messages.

00:57:58.163 --> 00:57:59.263
Text messages?

00:58:03.342 --> 00:58:04.542
What are you doing?

00:58:04.543 --> 00:58:06.612
Kill him. You must kill him.

00:58:14.282 --> 00:58:15.453
Who sent those messages?

00:58:16.353 --> 00:58:17.853
I don't know who it is.

00:58:18.422 --> 00:58:20.191
He says some guy gave him my number...

00:58:20.192 --> 00:58:21.893
and keeps sending me text messages.

00:58:23.023 --> 00:58:24.663
I don't know who it is.

00:58:26.063 --> 00:58:28.592
Can I see those text messages?

00:58:35.132 --> 00:58:36.402
Well, that's...

00:58:39.103 --> 00:58:40.773
I'm sure I received them.

00:58:41.043 --> 00:58:43.413
But when I check the next day,

00:58:44.513 --> 00:58:45.643
they're all gone.

00:58:48.552 --> 00:58:50.322
Have you talked to a shrink?

00:58:53.592 --> 00:58:54.623
No.

00:58:59.123 --> 00:59:01.132
You don't believe me, do you?

00:59:04.802 --> 00:59:06.032
To be honest,

00:59:08.333 --> 00:59:10.533
I think it'd be better for
you to go to hospital first.

00:59:33.063 --> 00:59:34.362
That man who sent the messages.

00:59:35.732 --> 00:59:37.632
You said he got your number from some guy.

00:59:39.032 --> 00:59:40.273
Do you know who that guy is?

00:59:56.183 --> 00:59:57.752
What's up? You hardly call me first.

00:59:59.282 --> 01:00:01.242
When someone possessed is
about to commit murder,

01:00:01.652 --> 01:00:04.422
you said you see the murder scene
through the devil's eyes, right?

01:00:04.922 --> 01:00:07.563
Yes, that's about right. Why?

01:00:07.993 --> 01:00:09.713
Have you seen something like that recently?

01:00:11.203 --> 01:00:13.502
No, I haven't. What's this about?

01:00:14.172 --> 01:00:16.543
I talked with a woman who seemed
to be possessed recently.

01:00:17.703 --> 01:00:19.572
You said he got your number from some guy.

01:00:21.043 --> 01:00:22.212
Do you know who that guy is?

01:00:25.643 --> 01:00:26.853
I don't know who he is.

01:00:28.513 --> 01:00:29.853
But I remember his name.

01:00:31.523 --> 01:00:32.723
It's Park Il Do.

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:35.052
Park Il Do?

01:00:36.123 --> 01:00:37.462
I heard the name clearly.

01:00:40.132 --> 01:00:41.362
Where is that woman?

01:00:41.893 --> 01:00:44.732
Is this where Kang Jong Ryul used to work?

01:00:44.862 --> 01:00:46.873
- Kang Jong Ryul?
- Yes. You don't know him?

01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:49.473
What's this about?

01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:53.571
We're from the police. Kang
Jong Ryul has gone missing.

01:00:53.572 --> 01:00:56.172
I don't know if you've noticed.
He didn't come to work, right?

01:00:56.743 --> 01:00:57.781
No.

01:00:57.782 --> 01:01:01.381
Is there anyone who can help
with our investigation?

01:01:01.382 --> 01:01:03.902
We have some questions to ask to
those who were close with him.

01:01:06.922 --> 01:01:07.953
Sir.

01:01:08.822 --> 01:01:11.893
They're from the police, and they're
looking for Kang Jong Ryul.

01:01:13.362 --> 01:01:14.433
Hello.

01:01:17.263 --> 01:01:18.532
Kang Jong Ryul quit.

01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:22.373
What's this about?

01:01:23.543 --> 01:01:25.942
He's involved in a case
that we are investigating.

01:01:26.203 --> 01:01:28.572
- What case?
- We can't give you the details.

01:01:29.072 --> 01:01:30.543
How long has it been since he quit?

01:01:30.982 --> 01:01:32.183
About a month?

01:01:32.982 --> 01:01:35.112
- I see. - Why did he quit?

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:37.252
I don't know. He was a rookie...

01:01:37.882 --> 01:01:40.052
and I guess he had trouble adjusting.
He just quit.

01:01:41.252 --> 01:01:44.462
You don't know about anything
strange that happened to him?

01:01:44.793 --> 01:01:46.732
No. We weren't that close.

01:01:47.462 --> 01:01:49.493
He had a girlfriend. Did you know?

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:52.933
- Did he have a girlfriend? - I don't know.

01:01:54.172 --> 01:01:55.873
Where was his seat?

01:01:56.442 --> 01:01:58.273
It was here. You can take a look.

01:01:58.402 --> 01:01:59.722
- Everything's still here? - Yes.

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:10.523
It's so hot. I thought summer was over.

01:02:12.453 --> 01:02:14.023
His co-workers...

01:02:15.652 --> 01:02:17.532
didn't seem to be close
with the victim at all.

01:02:17.623 --> 01:02:19.063
They worked together for six months.

01:02:19.493 --> 01:02:22.293
I know. He totally reminds me of someone.

01:02:24.333 --> 01:02:26.603
Come on, he's just like you.

01:02:32.302 --> 01:02:34.571
Yes. Did you get the phone records?

01:02:34.572 --> 01:02:37.043
Yes. On the day that he went missing,

01:02:37.112 --> 01:02:39.583
he spoke with his girlfriend several times.

01:02:40.212 --> 01:02:42.112
That woman was lying.

01:02:42.652 --> 01:02:44.683
Okay. Let's go see her.

01:02:46.523 --> 01:02:47.552
Darn it.

01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:54.731
What are you doing?

01:02:54.732 --> 01:02:56.263
Aren't you going to get revenge?

01:02:57.002 --> 01:02:58.032
I can't do it.

01:02:58.962 --> 01:03:01.172
I'm scared. I can't do it.

01:03:13.683 --> 01:03:14.882
"You idiot..."

01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:17.523
"You insect..."

01:03:18.853 --> 01:03:20.052
"If I were you..."

01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:24.822
"I'd kill myself."

01:04:27.123 --> 01:04:28.151
Where are you going?

01:04:28.152 --> 01:04:30.422
Move, you worthless orphan!

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:34.362
Let's have a talk.

01:04:36.032 --> 01:04:39.063
Your mom and your grandma died too.

01:04:40.072 --> 01:04:41.872
Your grandpa will die soon.

01:04:41.873 --> 01:04:42.973
Sohn has come.

01:04:44.502 --> 01:04:45.643
Did you meet Park Il Do?

01:04:48.313 --> 01:04:49.442
Where is Park Il Do?

01:04:51.982 --> 01:04:54.252
Come on. Let's go for another round.

01:04:54.953 --> 01:04:56.313
Come on, let's go!

01:05:04.092 --> 01:05:05.163
That organization.

01:05:06.663 --> 01:05:07.833
Where did you get this?

01:05:09.092 --> 01:05:10.263
Where did you get this?

01:05:20.172 --> 01:05:21.242
What's the matter?

01:05:21.243 --> 01:05:23.013
- Miss. - Please help me!

01:05:24.313 --> 01:05:25.341
What are you doing?

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:27.211
- Call the police. - Help me!

01:05:27.212 --> 01:05:28.982
It's nothing. Don't mind us.

01:05:30.023 --> 01:05:31.223
Ms. Kim.

01:05:31.523 --> 01:05:32.622
Get up, Ms. Kim.

01:05:32.623 --> 01:05:34.192
- Get up. - What are you doing?

01:05:34.422 --> 01:05:36.052
I said, what are you doing?

01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:37.522
I'm trying to help her.

01:05:37.523 --> 01:05:38.762
Move over.

01:05:38.763 --> 01:05:40.392
- Hey. - Let go of me.

01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:42.091
- Hey, call the police. - Let go!

01:05:42.092 --> 01:05:43.702
- We're trying to help her. - Ms. Kim.

01:05:43.703 --> 01:05:45.062
What is happening?

01:05:45.063 --> 01:05:46.063
Let go!

01:05:46.064 --> 01:05:47.401
- We're trying to help her. - Hey!

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:48.531
Come over here!

01:05:48.532 --> 01:05:50.301
- Grab him. - Call the police.

01:05:50.302 --> 01:05:53.002
- Let go of me. - Darn it.

01:06:10.893 --> 01:06:14.091
Kill him. I told you to kill him.

01:06:14.092 --> 01:06:15.132
I can't do it.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.702
Don't hold back. Kill everyone.

01:06:18.002 --> 01:06:20.172
Kill everyone!

01:06:20.372 --> 01:06:22.573
- Kill everyone. - I can't!

01:06:24.573 --> 01:06:26.642
Let me explain. This is a misunderstanding.

01:06:26.643 --> 01:06:27.671
No, it's not.

01:06:27.672 --> 01:06:29.541
We saw you attacking that lady.

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:31.312
What did you say?

01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:32.741
You have a problem?

01:06:32.742 --> 01:06:34.482
- Hey. - Come over here.

01:06:34.483 --> 01:06:37.022
- Listen to me. - You were hitting her.

01:06:37.023 --> 01:06:38.581
Everybody, calm down.

01:06:38.582 --> 01:06:40.522
What is he doing here?

01:06:40.523 --> 01:06:43.092
- Goodness. - What is this mess?

01:06:44.263 --> 01:06:45.922
Let's go home.

01:06:46.023 --> 01:06:47.631
What is this in the middle of the night?

01:06:47.632 --> 01:06:48.831
Let's go home.

01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:50.263
I can't get any sleep.

01:06:51.302 --> 01:06:52.403
What is this?

01:06:54.533 --> 01:06:55.672
What is that?

01:06:56.273 --> 01:06:57.372
Look!

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:47.323
Park Il Do.

01:07:47.622 --> 01:07:49.723
So he's the one who killed my mom?

01:07:50.263 --> 01:07:51.263
It has started.

01:07:51.492 --> 01:07:52.922
What made him possessed?

01:07:53.393 --> 01:07:56.092
I wonder what made him
so depressed and angry.

01:07:56.502 --> 01:07:58.262
It's too dangerous to exorcise a demon...

01:07:58.263 --> 01:07:59.503
that's directly related to you.

01:07:59.763 --> 01:08:01.131
We'll exorcize the demon.

01:08:01.132 --> 01:08:02.648
You shouldn't get involved, Detective.

01:08:02.672 --> 01:08:04.672
It's just as dangerous for the two of you.

01:08:04.973 --> 01:08:07.442
Why are you getting yourself
involved for no reason?

01:08:07.443 --> 01:08:10.113
You're just like your mother.

01:08:11.183 --> 01:08:13.013
I'll kill the woman first.
