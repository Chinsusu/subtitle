00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:27.140
- Look at that blood. - Is it that woman?

00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:28.570
Oh my gosh.

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.179
This is a misunderstanding.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040
You can talk at the police station.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.510
Hold on. Wait, let me say something.

00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:37.515
- Where are you going?
- I just need 10 seconds.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.950
Sohn came inside that woman. Do you know?

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.555
Sohn?

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.555
It's none of my business.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.190
- She might kill someone.
- She probably did already.

00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:49.930
What do you mean? I would've seen it then.

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.025
Leave the police to do their work.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.465
Tell them that I was just
trying to help that woman.

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:00.505
- Come on, let's go. - Wait.

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:04.010
You must keep an eye on her
since she's dangerous. Okay?

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:06.875
- Get in the car. - Okay, I'll get in.

00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.950
He's being taken away for assault.

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:16.815
- You're not going to help?
- He'll take care of himself.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.090
They said that you grabbed her
and threw her to the ground.

00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:24.230
Me? She went mad on her own
and did that to herself.

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.735
So tell me what your
relationship is with the victim.

00:01:29.206 --> 00:01:32.970
I'm in the same parish
council as Kim Yoon Hee.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:35.710
Kim Yoon Hee has some mental issues.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:40.515
And this handsome priest over
here provides counseling.

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:46.150
Kim Yoon Hee asked me to
bring him to her house...

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.915
so I brought him all the way over here.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.890
I did provide some counseling.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.365
See? So we came here...

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:00.769
but she suddenly started to throw a fit.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.570
And we were just trying to help her,

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.935
but those young punks
took it the wrong way.

00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.675
Can you recite the Lord's Prayer for me?

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.045
Sorry?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.885
Goodness.

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:20.885
I mean...

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:25.290
Why is that prayer important now?

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:27.229
Gosh, I can't believe these guys.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.790
You'll be punished.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:30.499
I'm a believer too.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.200
How dare you lie?

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:33.400
Lie?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.670
My Christian name is Emmanuel.

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:39.065
Are you really a priest?

00:02:42.512 --> 00:02:45.710
Let me go do a background
check on you two. Wait here.

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:49.745
If you lied to me and hit the woman,
you'll be sent to the chief station.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.725
You just can't stop lying.

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.260
What?

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.760
Would you rather have been sent to prison?

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.525
You provoked the possessed
woman earlier too.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.530
You started all this.

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:09.865
I didn't know she'd react that way.

00:03:10.207 --> 00:03:12.435
You said you had experienced
a lot of possessed people.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.905
Let's not fight. We don't
have time for that.

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:19.975
That possessed woman...

00:03:20.684 --> 00:03:22.510
might do something again any moment.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.485
She'll be fine for now.

00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.250
Detective Kang is with her.

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.785
I'm sure she's watching the woman closely.

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:33.155
Ms. Kim Yoon Hee.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:36.555
Can you answer me a few...

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.905
Ms. Kim Yoon Hee.

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.575
Is it really you?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.815
- What? - What do you mean?

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.755
Nothing.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:04.890
You talked to your boyfriend
the day he went missing.

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.585
Three times at that.

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:08.695
You lied to us.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.995
I don't...

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:12.960
remember.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.870
You talked on the phone before that too.

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.500
You said you broke up.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.740
That was a lie too, wasn't it?

00:04:18.742 --> 00:04:21.605
Tell us honestly what happened that day.

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:24.345
I don't want to talk about it.

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:27.049
Please leave her alone now.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.080
She needs some rest.

00:04:29.085 --> 00:04:30.845
You killed him.

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:33.445
You killed him and dumped the body.

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:36.015
Where is his body?

00:04:37.894 --> 00:04:39.525
I didn't.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.095
I really didn't.

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:43.760
Please leave now.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.695
Detective Kang, let's leave for now.
Let's go.

00:04:49.673 --> 00:04:53.065
I didn't kill him! I said I didn't!

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.635
Please go out.

00:04:56.746 --> 00:05:00.375
Calm down. Ms. Kim, you need to calm down.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.915
Calm down.

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:13.329
She seems mentally unstable.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.390
I think I'll look into her medical records.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.530
It might not be a mental problem.

00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.095
Then?

00:05:22.872 --> 00:05:26.135
Nothing. Let me talk to her
again when she calms down.

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.770
I don't think you'll be
able to talk to her today.

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:30.010
Why don't we come back later?

00:05:30.013 --> 00:05:31.810
We have to keep an eye on her.

00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:33.645
We don't know what she might do.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:36.745
Are you saying we should stake out here?

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.390
The patient wants me to tell you this.

00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:46.085
She said her boyfriend is waiting
in the parking lot near her place.

00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:51.195
If he's waiting, is he still alive?

00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:54.365
I'm not sure. We'll see.

00:05:54.738 --> 00:05:56.900
I think we're almost there.

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:59.335
Take that way.

00:06:00.744 --> 00:06:02.575
She might kill someone.

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:07.410
What?

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.150
I think she said that on purpose.

00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:10.785
She wanted to ditch us.

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.515
I think I'll go back to her.

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:14.820
She wanted to ditch us? Why?

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:16.550
You go to her boyfriend.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:18.460
I'll go back to the woman.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.625
Okay? Hurry up! Get out right now!

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.410
How dare she boss me around?

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.515
She's getting worse and worse.

00:06:47.757 --> 00:06:51.125
Where is he?

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:58.425
Why is this car covered?

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:03.235
Gosh, it stinks.

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:34.265
The patient went missing.

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.335
Take me home!

00:08:02.765 --> 00:08:04.565
Who are you?

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:06.460
What are you doing here?

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:08.030
I'm sorry.

00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:10.365
I'm lost.

00:08:10.607 --> 00:08:12.265
And I don't have my phone with me.

00:08:15.345 --> 00:08:16.935
You want to...

00:08:17.013 --> 00:08:18.605
borrow my phone?

00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:32.720
Are you working late alone?

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:34.830
Yes. Why?

00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:38.030
I guess the rest will be
back here by 9am tomorrow.

00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:39.930
What? What are you talking about?

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:44.039
Then I'll have to wait until
9am and kill everyone.

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.665
First,

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:47.635
let me start with you.

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:32.885
Sir! My goodness.

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:42.030
Pull yourself together.

00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:43.460
Hwa Pyung.

00:09:43.466 --> 00:09:46.660
Take me home.

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.200
Please take me home.

00:09:49.205 --> 00:09:52.065
- Where do you live? - I don't remember.

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.405
Hwa Pyung.

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:02.350
What's going on?

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:03.680
Hwa Pyung.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.445
- What are you doing? - Let go of him.

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:07.820
Pull yourself together.

00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:09.450
- Let go of him. - What are you doing?

00:10:09.459 --> 00:10:10.559
Calm down. What's with you?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.385
Pull yourself together.

00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.630
- Hwa Pyung! - Are you okay?

00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:16.195
Hey!

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:18.030
Hwa Pyung, snap out of it!

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.265
Hey! Pull yourself together!

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:24.405
Hey!

00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:34.075
It has begun.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.020
So? She killed the man?

00:10:44.027 --> 00:10:46.060
He's still alive. But...

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:49.695
she said she'd kill everyone when
they come to work tomorrow morning.

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:51.595
Work?

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:54.565
Is it an office?

00:10:55.138 --> 00:10:56.895
Do you have any idea where that place is?

00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.365
It looked like an office.

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:01.435
There was a big mirror.

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:04.545
On the victim's desk...

00:11:04.647 --> 00:11:07.980
were drawings of tanks and weapons.

00:11:07.984 --> 00:11:09.575
Drawings of tanks and weapons...

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:12.015
on the desk?

00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:14.385
They're looking for Kang Jong Ryul.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.555
Kang Jong Ryul quit.

00:11:20.797 --> 00:11:22.725
You guys should go home.

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:26.765
If you act up again, I'll arrest you again.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.195
You know something, don't you?

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:35.235
Park Il Do.

00:11:36.245 --> 00:11:38.005
We should catch them
together, shouldn't we?

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:39.440
Let me come with you.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.045
Park Il Do.

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:44.645
I said I don't want to get
involved with that anymore.

00:11:44.921 --> 00:11:47.720
All I want is to catch the suspect
who killed her boyfriend.

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.415
But you're involved.

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:51.455
Your mother.

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:58.025
Don't you ever talk about her again.

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:05.665
- Detective Kang. - Leave her alone.

00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:10.805
Let her go.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.075
I don't...

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:15.510
want you to drag her into this.

00:12:15.518 --> 00:12:17.115
What are you talking about?

00:12:19.555 --> 00:12:21.585
We might put her in danger as well.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.655
Let's go for now. We need more information.

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:38.540
Yes. Kim Yoon Hee is not at home.

00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:40.965
Yes. Yes.

00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:47.849
This is a crime.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.710
This is an emergency. Don't be so fussy.

00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:51.180
We have to figure out
why she got possessed.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.415
Then we will know why she killed people.

00:12:53.923 --> 00:12:56.285
The police might come back.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.855
So let's be quick and run away.

00:13:24.854 --> 00:13:27.215
Are you sure she killed her boyfriend?

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.559
They look sweet together.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.125
That's true.

00:13:33.362 --> 00:13:35.290
Then who was that man?

00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:38.125
Why did she try to kill his coworkers?

00:13:39.368 --> 00:13:41.269
I wonder why she got possessed.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.335
What made her so sad...

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:45.765
and angry?

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:51.540
Do you think the suspect will be there?

00:13:51.547 --> 00:13:54.205
That woman must be there.

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:55.510
Hey, Kang.

00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.145
You have always been more
intuitive than me. I know that.

00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:01.289
But you're so mean these days.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.390
You make me feel like a fool.

00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:06.285
What's the thing I don't know?

00:14:13.302 --> 00:14:14.300
Did you have a look?

00:14:14.303 --> 00:14:15.500
Yes, we have the cause of death.

00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:18.270
It's excessive bleeding from a cut
of the radial artery of wrist.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.305
- It looks like a suicide. - What?

00:14:21.244 --> 00:14:22.875
Okay.

00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:26.405
What in the world happened?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.950
Who are you?

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.415
So you're her friend. What brings you here?

00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:34.720
I heard from the hospital
that she went missing.

00:14:34.724 --> 00:14:37.955
- I was wondering if she came home.
- I see.

00:14:38.261 --> 00:14:39.985
We're looking for her as well.

00:14:40.196 --> 00:14:41.790
Speaking of which,

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.960
do you know if Kim Yoon Hee
had concerns these days?

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.100
Could there be someone
holding grudges against her?

00:14:47.103 --> 00:14:49.630
Why do you ask?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:51.735
I had a talk with her,

00:14:52.008 --> 00:14:54.035
but she won't tell me about it.

00:14:56.879 --> 00:14:58.475
Well.

00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.050
She has been having a hard
time because of her boyfriend.

00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:04.275
- Her boyfriend? - Yes.

00:15:04.687 --> 00:15:06.245
Well...

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:09.455
In the office,

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:12.460
Jong Ryul got bullied by his coworkers.

00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:14.795
- Bullied? - Yes.

00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:18.365
That's why Jong Ryul quit his job.

00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:20.525
They were supposed to get married.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.665
And my friend...

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.370
So the company I saw was
her boyfriend's company.

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:28.610
It was her revenge against those
who bullied her boyfriend.

00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:31.475
We don't know yet. We'll find
the answer when we get there.

00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:34.345
Call Detective Kang.

00:15:36.052 --> 00:15:38.480
What a creepy building.

00:15:38.487 --> 00:15:40.550
Do we still have to guard the back door?

00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:43.115
You go to the back door.
I'll go to the front door.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.385
Why do I go to the back door?

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:50.225
Then you go to the front door.

00:15:52.234 --> 00:15:53.730
I have hemorrhoids, so
I'll go to the back door.

00:15:53.736 --> 00:15:56.100
Gosh, I must be nervous.
I'm saying nonsense.

00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:57.695
Bong Sang.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.909
Be careful. The suspect is
different from normal people.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.310
You keep saying that and it scares me more.

00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:04.740
You said it's a woman.

00:16:04.747 --> 00:16:09.275
I mean, she's mentally unstable.
So be careful.

00:16:09.885 --> 00:16:11.915
- Bong Sang. - Why?

00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:14.189
Please be careful. Okay?

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.785
Fine.

00:16:15.992 --> 00:16:18.425
Give me a flashlight.
Wait, we have only one.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.525
Darn it.

00:17:34.203 --> 00:17:35.835
She won't pick up the phone.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.035
Hwa Pyung.

00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:59.185
Hwa Pyung.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.995
Wake up!

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:12.665
What did you see this time?

00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:16.375
Detective Goh.

00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:29.920
What is it?

00:18:29.925 --> 00:18:32.360
You're in danger. Get out of the place now.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:33.590
I'm busy now.

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.530
Detective Goh got attacked!

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:37.355
Hwa Pyung saw it.

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:40.125
What?

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.135
Give it to me.

00:18:42.471 --> 00:18:45.365
Detective Kang, don't go in.
If you go in...

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.305
Don't go. If you go there,

00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:51.675
you will die.

00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:58.045
Hello.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:02.015
Why she never listen to me?

00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:20.125
Help me.

00:20:36.785 --> 00:20:38.480
Help me.

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.215
Hang in there.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.255
When everyone comes to work,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.525
I'll kill all of you then.

00:21:55.798 --> 00:21:57.795
Where's the detective who came with me?

00:21:59.001 --> 00:22:01.165
Why are you doing this?

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:05.605
I have to kill everyone at this company.

00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:08.165
That's what she wants.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.105
Because of her boyfriend?

00:22:10.813 --> 00:22:12.445
Yes.

00:22:14.483 --> 00:22:16.445
Those jerks...

00:22:16.685 --> 00:22:19.415
harassed her boyfriend.

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.515
They bullied him...

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.625
and tormented him.

00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:28.795
Again and again.

00:22:29.565 --> 00:22:31.455
Without any reason.

00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:34.160
- Is he still working?
- He's still working.

00:22:34.169 --> 00:22:35.965
My goodness.

00:22:36.004 --> 00:22:37.470
I called him before.

00:22:37.473 --> 00:22:39.900
Yesterday, I called out his name.

00:22:39.908 --> 00:22:42.075
- Jong Ryul. - "Yes?"

00:22:43.045 --> 00:22:44.735
That's so funny.

00:22:45.013 --> 00:22:47.440
He's so bad at his work.

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:49.280
He had no prior work experience...

00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.219
and they started to bully him
because he was clumsy at work.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.280
He should at least have some
wits if he's bad at work.

00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:55.755
It started with something small...

00:22:55.891 --> 00:22:58.090
and the bullying got worse.

00:22:58.093 --> 00:23:00.485
Do you think this a joke, you fool?

00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:03.730
Jong Ryul.

00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:05.130
Yes?

00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.630
Yes.

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:09.170
- Yes! - Yes!

00:23:09.171 --> 00:23:10.930
- Yes! - I heard they cursed...

00:23:10.939 --> 00:23:12.140
and started to hit him later.

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:13.735
Yes!

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:17.575
- Let's go. - He couldn't tell anyone.

00:23:18.414 --> 00:23:21.245
Who would believe an adult
could get bullied at work?

00:23:27.022 --> 00:23:29.185
So he quit his job.

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:33.025
But he couldn't stand the stress.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.595
The text messages that
those jerks sent him.

00:23:39.001 --> 00:23:40.725
"Idiot."

00:23:41.303 --> 00:23:43.135
"You insect."

00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:45.135
"If I were you.."

00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:47.665
"I'll just kill myself."

00:24:21.076 --> 00:24:22.905
So he eventually committed suicide.

00:24:24.947 --> 00:24:28.075
He apologized for calling this woman...

00:24:28.116 --> 00:24:29.945
and slashed his wrists.

00:24:40.996 --> 00:24:43.755
This woman tried to commit suicide too.

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:49.295
But at that moment...

00:24:51.306 --> 00:24:53.235
we came.

00:24:56.311 --> 00:24:58.105
That hopelessness...

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.205
sadness...

00:25:01.216 --> 00:25:02.580
and anger!

00:25:02.584 --> 00:25:04.180
She had to take revenge, not suicide.

00:25:04.186 --> 00:25:06.615
You have to kill everyone! Kill them!

00:25:08.724 --> 00:25:10.685
We whispered into his ear.

00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:15.425
Are you Park Il Do?

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:19.525
Did Park Il Do make you do this?

00:25:21.069 --> 00:25:23.895
This will be the last time...

00:25:24.206 --> 00:25:26.265
you even mention his name.

00:25:30.245 --> 00:25:32.375
I better change my plans.

00:25:32.681 --> 00:25:35.875
I will go to all their homes
and kill them one by one.

00:25:37.886 --> 00:25:40.185
I'll cut his throat first.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.415
Please don't.

00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.325
Help me!

00:25:49.531 --> 00:25:51.255
Please spare me.

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:29.165
You people are all the same.

00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:33.535
You butt in and eventually
get killed in the end.

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:40.880
Detective Kang!

00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:42.410
Detective Kang.

00:26:42.417 --> 00:26:44.015
Detective Kang!

00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:46.520
That priest came too. That brat.

00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:48.085
Detective Kang!

00:26:52.494 --> 00:26:54.420
Detective Kang, where are you?

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:56.025
Detective Kang!

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.495
Kim Yoon Hee!

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:02.820
In the name of the Lord,

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.325
I will tie you up with the holy rope.

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:17.535
She fainted.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:20.100
Detective Kang.

00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:21.905
Go to Detective Kang.

00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:24.835
Will you be okay on your own?

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:39.025
- Are you okay? - The key is in my pocket.

00:29:41.329 --> 00:29:44.195
Wait. Are you badly injured?

00:29:44.232 --> 00:29:46.730
I'm okay. Call for an ambulance.

00:29:46.735 --> 00:29:48.369
Please help me.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.495
Help me!

00:29:50.639 --> 00:29:52.235
Hold on.

00:29:53.074 --> 00:29:54.240
Are you alright?

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:55.975
Hold on.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:06.015
Are you okay?

00:30:07.923 --> 00:30:09.590
What happened to Detective Goh?

00:30:09.591 --> 00:30:12.085
Let's call an ambulance
first and look for him.

00:31:06.781 --> 00:31:08.345
Detective Goh.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.245
Are you okay?

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.680
- Are you okay? - What happened?

00:31:13.688 --> 00:31:15.420
I'm not okay.

00:31:15.423 --> 00:31:17.115
I got ambushed.

00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:20.190
I got hit on the head.

00:31:20.195 --> 00:31:22.029
The strength was not human.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.455
Gosh.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:26.525
What is he doing here?

00:31:29.571 --> 00:31:31.235
Where's the priest?

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.985
Your brother.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.955
Who made your brother become like that?

00:31:56.364 --> 00:31:57.925
Right?

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:01.965
You do think it's all Yun Hwa
Pyung's fault, don't you?

00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:09.135
You hate him.

00:32:09.477 --> 00:32:12.510
You're going to die because of him.

00:32:12.514 --> 00:32:14.845
Just like your brother.

00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:18.315
Just like your mom and dad!

00:32:30.332 --> 00:32:32.460
Everyone near him is going to die.

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:34.825
He's just like us.

00:32:37.939 --> 00:32:40.435
He's like us.

00:32:43.812 --> 00:32:45.705
"He's like us."

00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:49.345
What do you mean by that?

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:52.515
Father.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.585
It hurts.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.055
Please let go of me.

00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:03.095
It hurts.

00:33:03.665 --> 00:33:06.665
Please release me.

00:33:21.483 --> 00:33:23.115
Hold on.

00:33:37.632 --> 00:33:38.930
What were you doing?

00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:41.295
You gave in. You almost released her.

00:33:42.537 --> 00:33:44.395
You said you'd be fine by yourself.

00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:52.235
I'm okay.

00:33:52.781 --> 00:33:54.545
I'm okay now.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.150
Let me go! Release me!

00:33:58.153 --> 00:33:59.985
Release me!

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.190
We don't have much time. Let's start.

00:34:07.195 --> 00:34:09.490
You two can leave now. I
can do this by myself.

00:34:09.497 --> 00:34:11.430
You can't do it alone.

00:34:11.433 --> 00:34:13.265
It was dangerous.

00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:15.095
Worry about yourself.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.235
The police will be here any moment.
Get on with it!

00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:20.540
You're that girl.

00:34:20.542 --> 00:34:22.140
Don't you hate each other?

00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:25.135
Think of why your mom died.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.680
Think of what they did!

00:34:28.683 --> 00:34:30.315
Don't look at her!

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:32.215
And don't answer her.

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:34.885
Hold her down.

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:55.935
I won't record anything.

00:35:15.263 --> 00:35:19.495
In the name of the Father and Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:27.340
Illustrious leader of the heavenly army,

00:35:27.342 --> 00:35:28.709
the Angel Saint Michael...

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.470
Kill this jerk!

00:35:30.478 --> 00:35:32.379
Kill everyone!

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.915
Help me!

00:35:38.753 --> 00:35:40.345
Park Il Do.

00:35:42.257 --> 00:35:43.855
Where is Park Il Do?

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:46.059
Who did he possess after Priest Choi?

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.455
How is he related to Sharing Hands?

00:35:48.863 --> 00:35:52.330
I'll kill your dearest one.

00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:55.730
Stabbed in the neck, he'll vomit blood...

00:35:55.737 --> 00:35:58.265
and die!

00:36:14.856 --> 00:36:16.485
Pull yourself together.

00:36:16.691 --> 00:36:20.025
If you do it again, I'll kick you out.

00:36:20.662 --> 00:36:23.795
You'll all die in the end.

00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:27.230
You'll beat each other to death,

00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:29.295
stab each other,

00:36:29.537 --> 00:36:31.595
and cut each other's throat.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.940
Lord created mankind...

00:36:36.945 --> 00:36:39.575
in His own image...

00:36:39.747 --> 00:36:41.710
and saved us from the demon...

00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:44.575
at a great cost. Please come rescue us.

00:36:50.658 --> 00:36:53.060
Holy Church venerates you as
their patron and guardian.

00:36:53.061 --> 00:36:55.160
The Lord has entrusted to you...

00:36:55.163 --> 00:36:57.860
the task of leading the
souls of the redeemed...

00:36:57.865 --> 00:37:00.465
to heavenly blessedness.

00:37:06.341 --> 00:37:09.105
What are you doing? Are
you trying to kill her?

00:37:09.377 --> 00:37:11.335
Please save me.

00:37:11.512 --> 00:37:13.305
Help me.

00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:17.845
Don't look at her!

00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:22.685
Saint Michael the Archangel.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.750
Entreat the Lord of peace...

00:37:24.759 --> 00:37:26.159
to cast the demon down under our feet,

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160
so as to keep him from further
holding man captive...

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:29.260
Help me.

00:37:29.264 --> 00:37:30.560
And doing harm to the Church.

00:37:30.565 --> 00:37:33.565
This man tried to rape me.

00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:37.665
He tried to humiliate me.

00:37:37.739 --> 00:37:40.605
He's doing this to cover it up.

00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:43.175
Please, ma'am.

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:46.945
Please help me.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.350
Don't give in. Hold her down!

00:37:51.352 --> 00:37:52.550
I want to go home.

00:37:52.553 --> 00:37:55.050
- Carry our prayers up to the Lord,
- Help me.

00:37:55.056 --> 00:37:56.650
That the mercy of the Lord...

00:37:56.658 --> 00:37:57.890
Help me.

00:37:57.892 --> 00:37:59.190
May quickly come.

00:37:59.193 --> 00:38:02.160
Lay hold of the beast, the
serpent of old, and his demons,

00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:04.160
casting him in chains into the abyss,

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:07.625
so that he can no longer
seduce the nations.

00:38:09.971 --> 00:38:13.235
Release me.

00:38:13.341 --> 00:38:17.310
Save me, you wench!

00:38:17.312 --> 00:38:20.380
Let me smash your head
just like your mom's.

00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:24.945
If it weren't for you, I
wouldn't have passed that house.

00:38:25.253 --> 00:38:26.785
Young.

00:38:27.655 --> 00:38:29.315
My dear Young.

00:38:30.158 --> 00:38:32.985
You shouldn't have been born.

00:38:33.328 --> 00:38:36.595
You should have died with me.

00:38:37.198 --> 00:38:38.855
Gil Young.

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:49.975
Mom!

00:38:53.448 --> 00:38:55.105
Don't give in!

00:38:55.616 --> 00:38:58.475
It's the spirit talking. Ignore it.

00:39:42.363 --> 00:39:43.955
Kim Yoon Hee.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.425
Do you hear me?

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.535
Yoon Hee?

00:39:58.379 --> 00:40:00.445
Where is she?

00:40:02.316 --> 00:40:03.875
She's not here.

00:40:07.288 --> 00:40:09.145
She wanted to die.

00:40:10.625 --> 00:40:12.985
She begged us to kill her.

00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:18.090
When her boyfriend died, she
wanted to kill herself,

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:20.465
but we saved her.

00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:23.895
So she's ours!

00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:28.705
Yoon Hee.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.175
You have to survive. You
have to overcome this.

00:40:32.747 --> 00:40:34.440
Think of your baby.

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:36.875
Think of your baby in your womb!

00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:38.545
Baby?

00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:42.545
In addition, my friend...

00:40:43.291 --> 00:40:47.020
is pregnant...

00:40:47.028 --> 00:40:49.260
with her boyfriend's baby.

00:40:49.263 --> 00:40:51.455
If we fail to save her,
the baby will die too.

00:40:56.737 --> 00:40:59.865
Yoon Hee. Look at this.

00:41:00.341 --> 00:41:02.535
Look at your boyfriend.

00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:08.375
The baby's father is the man you loved.

00:41:08.649 --> 00:41:11.415
Even if you lost your boyfriend,
you should save your baby.

00:41:13.087 --> 00:41:15.585
You have to live for the baby to survive.

00:41:17.859 --> 00:41:19.455
You can get over this.

00:41:19.727 --> 00:41:21.555
Please don't die!

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.655
Keep holding it like that.

00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:26.265
Hold her tightly.

00:41:28.603 --> 00:41:30.770
If you're a follower of the underworld,

00:41:30.771 --> 00:41:32.635
I say to you,

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.700
under the name of the almighty, get lost!

00:41:34.709 --> 00:41:36.940
The almighty up above is...

00:41:36.944 --> 00:41:38.710
the only true almighty.

00:41:38.713 --> 00:41:40.710
Go back to the demon...

00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:42.449
and deliver my message.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.610
Help me.

00:41:43.618 --> 00:41:47.285
In the name of the Father and Son...

00:41:49.957 --> 00:41:51.585
Help me.

00:41:51.792 --> 00:41:53.090
Help me!

00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:55.929
I command In the name
of the Father and Son.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:00.765
Park Il Do! Park Il Do!

00:42:01.636 --> 00:42:04.095
I command in the name of the almighty.
Get lost.

00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:07.070
I command in the name
of the Father and Son.

00:42:07.074 --> 00:42:11.135
Park Il Do!

00:43:28.623 --> 00:43:29.990
Is it over?

00:43:29.991 --> 00:43:33.259
Detective Goh and Kim Yoon Hee
are taken to the hospital.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.520
That employer is safe now as well.

00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:36.895
What's going to happen to Kim Yoon Hee now?

00:43:39.734 --> 00:43:41.400
On suspicion of kidnapping
and obstruction of justice,

00:43:41.402 --> 00:43:43.495
she'll be arrested and
brought to the court.

00:43:43.504 --> 00:43:45.870
If it's not an attempt murder,
it'd be an assault at best.

00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:48.070
Kim Yoon Hee is innocent.

00:43:48.075 --> 00:43:50.575
It's Park Il Do's fault.

00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:52.440
I should get going.

00:43:52.446 --> 00:43:54.205
Why did you ask me to stay?

00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:56.105
Park Il Do.

00:43:56.617 --> 00:43:59.375
You said he is the one who
killed my mother, right?

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.185
And he's not in Father Choi now.
He moved to another person.

00:44:03.457 --> 00:44:05.085
Park Il Do.

00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.425
Let's catch him.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.690
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

00:44:10.698 --> 00:44:12.699
I don't know if he's a demon or a ghost,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:14.500
but I can't stand this anymore.

00:44:14.502 --> 00:44:16.400
He turns innocent people into murderers...

00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:18.035
and kills people.

00:44:18.239 --> 00:44:20.140
Once you start, you can't give up...

00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:22.240
until either we die or he dies.

00:44:22.243 --> 00:44:24.040
You can't quit in the middle.

00:44:24.045 --> 00:44:25.675
I won't quit.

00:44:26.113 --> 00:44:27.210
I will try until I catch him.

00:44:27.214 --> 00:44:28.875
You can't join us.

00:44:33.788 --> 00:44:35.420
This is about possession.

00:44:35.423 --> 00:44:37.985
Hwa Pyung and I, a priest,
will take care of it.

00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:39.955
It's too dangerous for you.

00:44:40.594 --> 00:44:42.960
It's dangerous for you too.

00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:45.060
And this is a murder case.

00:44:45.066 --> 00:44:47.760
We will chase the demon.
You stay out of it.

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:49.930
This is how it's supposed
to be from the beginning.

00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:51.330
This is how it always has been.

00:44:51.338 --> 00:44:53.465
Now I must join you...

00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:55.905
just like how it has been.

00:45:00.314 --> 00:45:02.405
I said it's dangerous for you.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:06.315
I don't need your concern.

00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:08.920
Don't remind me of the past.
It's irritating.

00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:11.550
Stop it.

00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:14.125
Do you still have energy to do that?

00:45:16.197 --> 00:45:18.425
Let me repeat myself. You can't join us.

00:45:18.866 --> 00:45:20.965
Call me if something happens.

00:45:24.705 --> 00:45:27.970
You can't just leave like that.
We didn't say anything yet.

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:29.635
Hey, priest.

00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:31.535
Father.

00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:38.975
What about you?

00:45:40.688 --> 00:45:42.245
Me?

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:43.855
I'd like that.

00:45:45.025 --> 00:45:46.625
We should work together.

00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:50.295
I'll talk to him.

00:45:54.368 --> 00:45:56.065
I should get going as well.

00:45:56.871 --> 00:45:58.430
Don't make trouble. Just go home and rest.

00:45:58.439 --> 00:46:01.065
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:03.910
Don't worry. I'll take a taxi.

00:46:03.911 --> 00:46:06.005
So I'll give you a ride.

00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:16.350
I'm going to be fired from
the taxi company again.

00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:18.755
Straight to the hospital, right?

00:46:18.793 --> 00:46:21.190
No, let me get off at a
nearby subway station.

00:46:21.195 --> 00:46:22.529
I'm going home.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.595
You have to treat your wound first.

00:46:25.366 --> 00:46:27.265
I'll take a good sleep and it'll be okay.

00:46:29.136 --> 00:46:31.100
If you show up like that,
your family will worry.

00:46:31.105 --> 00:46:32.995
I don't have such a thing.

00:46:34.575 --> 00:46:36.509
Then you should make a family first.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.940
You should get married.

00:46:37.945 --> 00:46:41.305
Shut it and just drive.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:44.580
I also have no one but a grandfather.

00:46:44.585 --> 00:46:47.120
I lost contact with my
father when I was young.

00:46:47.121 --> 00:46:49.015
When this is over,

00:46:49.423 --> 00:46:52.415
I want to have a normal life too.

00:46:55.763 --> 00:46:57.695
I guess that will be difficult.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:02.425
Since that thing happened when I was young,

00:47:02.803 --> 00:47:06.570
I've been wondering why my
mother did that every day.

00:47:06.574 --> 00:47:08.774
I've been wondering why she
did such a dangerous thing.

00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:10.505
Once she dies,

00:47:11.812 --> 00:47:13.845
her daughter would have no one.

00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:17.775
When you told me earlier not to go in,

00:47:19.153 --> 00:47:21.685
I found myself going in without thinking.

00:47:21.889 --> 00:47:23.969
I couldn't help because
Detective Goh was in danger.

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.085
I guess I'm just like my mom.

00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:28.990
If I had a family,

00:47:28.996 --> 00:47:31.025
they wouldn't like me.

00:47:33.834 --> 00:47:35.395
I'm sorry.

00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:37.635
If only I wasn't...

00:47:37.838 --> 00:47:39.965
standing on the road 20 years ago.

00:47:39.974 --> 00:47:41.565
Then...

00:47:41.675 --> 00:47:43.805
Mateo would have died.

00:47:44.411 --> 00:47:48.175
You should have rather not stopped me...

00:47:48.716 --> 00:47:50.715
when I tried to go in.

00:47:50.885 --> 00:47:53.985
Then I wouldn't have so much regret now...

00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:58.155
that I did nothing but watch my mom die.

00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:01.725
Hwa Pyung.

00:48:02.096 --> 00:48:04.725
Hwa Pyung.

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:08.500
Hwa Pyung.

00:48:08.502 --> 00:48:11.070
Hwa Pyung!

00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:12.695
You're right.

00:48:13.741 --> 00:48:16.635
I should have died then as well.

00:48:20.514 --> 00:48:23.105
Why isn't he answering?

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:27.215
Hello.

00:48:27.388 --> 00:48:28.980
Hwa Pyung?

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.790
Why do you pick up the phone so late?

00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:32.450
You got me worried.

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:34.620
I'm fine.

00:48:34.628 --> 00:48:38.160
I had a drink last night.

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:40.430
Are you sure?

00:48:40.434 --> 00:48:43.430
Are you sure it's not... Forget it.

00:48:43.437 --> 00:48:44.600
What is it?

00:48:44.605 --> 00:48:47.500
Are you doing strange things again?

00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.670
Last time...

00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:50.710
I'm not doing anything dangerous.

00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:52.505
How do you feel?

00:48:53.113 --> 00:48:56.275
Take care of your own body.

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.510
Before I die,

00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:00.780
I want to see a grandchild.

00:49:00.788 --> 00:49:04.120
You're a fine-looking guy just like me.

00:49:04.124 --> 00:49:05.650
What's wrong with you?

00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:07.690
You're not dating anyone?

00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:09.655
Are you too shy?

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.630
Is it because you're bad at flirting...

00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:14.630
or you have a physical problem?

00:49:14.635 --> 00:49:16.700
I don't have any problem.

00:49:16.704 --> 00:49:19.435
Now I see you nagging me, you're fine.
I'll hang up.

00:49:49.436 --> 00:49:51.095
Are you saying...

00:49:51.372 --> 00:49:53.305
I should quit exorcising?

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:54.670
Yes.

00:49:54.675 --> 00:49:56.970
After talking to you,

00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:59.479
the woman not only committed
suicide but also a crime.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:01.075
She...

00:50:02.516 --> 00:50:03.649
She was possessed.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:05.150
Nothing was filmed.

00:50:05.152 --> 00:50:08.045
There was no priest nor
doctor at the meeting either.

00:50:08.122 --> 00:50:10.015
We have rules here.

00:50:10.124 --> 00:50:12.215
The bishop is very upset.

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:15.155
As of today,

00:50:15.362 --> 00:50:16.790
Mateo, you're dismissed from...

00:50:16.797 --> 00:50:18.425
the position of exorcist priest.

00:50:19.867 --> 00:50:21.425
Your brother.

00:50:21.668 --> 00:50:24.635
Who made your brother become like that?

00:50:25.606 --> 00:50:28.435
Just like your mom and dad!

00:50:30.344 --> 00:50:32.775
Everyone near him is going to die.

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.605
He is just like us.

00:50:55.769 --> 00:50:57.365
Hello?

00:50:58.238 --> 00:50:59.895
Are you listening?

00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:02.735
I have a favor to ask you.

00:51:16.223 --> 00:51:19.250
Are you drinking again?

00:51:19.259 --> 00:51:21.620
After your brother was found,

00:51:21.628 --> 00:51:23.755
I can't fall asleep without a drink.

00:51:24.665 --> 00:51:26.695
I'm going to quit.

00:51:27.734 --> 00:51:30.900
By the way, you mentioned
the Sharing Hands book.

00:51:30.904 --> 00:51:32.700
Everyone who was possessed by Park Il Do.

00:51:32.706 --> 00:51:34.340
The junk yard brothers,

00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:36.435
and Kim Yoon Hee who I talked with.

00:51:37.211 --> 00:51:39.140
They all had the Sharing Hands book.

00:51:39.146 --> 00:51:41.440
Do you mean that Sharing Hands...

00:51:41.448 --> 00:51:43.645
and Park Il Do are related?

00:51:43.784 --> 00:51:45.445
I'm not sure yet.

00:51:45.552 --> 00:51:47.920
- I have to investigate... - No.

00:51:47.921 --> 00:51:49.545
That can't be.

00:51:50.023 --> 00:51:52.185
It's a volunteer group at church.

00:51:52.326 --> 00:51:53.925
It can't be.

00:51:55.062 --> 00:51:56.695
Do you...

00:51:57.564 --> 00:51:59.430
really want to find Park Il Do?

00:51:59.433 --> 00:52:01.395
With that guy named Hwa Pyung?

00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.495
Yes. Father Yang,

00:52:05.906 --> 00:52:08.505
while you worked as an
exorcist priest before,

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:12.979
did you ever hear things?

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.305
I heard things and had hallucinations.

00:52:15.382 --> 00:52:17.380
I even saw an exorcist priest...

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:19.380
who worshiped the devil.

00:52:19.386 --> 00:52:21.220
The more you practice exorcism,

00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:23.750
the spirit of the exorcist
priest gets damaged.

00:52:23.757 --> 00:52:25.415
How can I put it?

00:52:28.996 --> 00:52:33.565
It's like the devil is gnawing
away your spirit slowly.

00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:45.875
What is it?

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.175
Did you hear something?

00:52:51.485 --> 00:52:53.545
If you did, you must quit right now.

00:52:53.654 --> 00:52:56.815
Chasing the devil that's directly
related to you is very dangerous.

00:52:57.057 --> 00:52:59.515
- I have no choice. - Mateo!

00:53:04.965 --> 00:53:07.460
I should have ended this a long time ago.

00:53:07.467 --> 00:53:09.765
If you follow in your brother's footsteps,

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.170
how will I be able to live?

00:53:12.172 --> 00:53:14.665
You became a priest because of me too.

00:53:15.242 --> 00:53:16.770
It's too dangerous.

00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.740
I chose to become a priest.

00:53:18.745 --> 00:53:20.340
In order to find my brother.

00:53:20.347 --> 00:53:22.345
And I've made my choice again.

00:53:23.817 --> 00:53:26.375
Help me, Father Yang.

00:53:30.524 --> 00:53:32.690
The weather is perfect.

00:53:32.693 --> 00:53:35.060
I just want to go to the
ocean and catch fish.

00:53:35.062 --> 00:53:38.390
Some fresh fish and a glass of
soju sounds perfect right now.

00:53:38.398 --> 00:53:41.265
All my troubles will be washed away.

00:53:43.237 --> 00:53:46.835
It's too bad we're the
only ones to enjoy this.

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:50.740
But why do you suddenly want
to drink soju near the ocean?

00:53:50.744 --> 00:53:53.775
What? Oh, no reason.

00:53:54.047 --> 00:53:57.950
Let's drop by my old hometown
village on the way there.

00:53:57.951 --> 00:53:59.615
Your hometown?

00:53:59.686 --> 00:54:01.280
That place is terrifying.

00:54:01.288 --> 00:54:04.090
I have to find the last person
Priest Choi had contact with.

00:54:04.091 --> 00:54:06.785
Park Il Do probably possessed that person.

00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:11.360
I want you to check the place
where Priest Choi died.

00:54:11.365 --> 00:54:13.195
See if you can see anything.

00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:29.375
So you want me to take a look
at Priest Choi's spirit?

00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:33.315
It'd be nice if you find Park Il Do too.

00:54:37.791 --> 00:54:39.455
Fine.

00:54:40.093 --> 00:54:41.960
Instead of being killed by a
superior spirit over there,

00:54:41.962 --> 00:54:44.155
why don't we just die right now?

00:54:44.665 --> 00:54:48.600
Why don't we become spirits
that haunt this road...

00:54:48.602 --> 00:54:50.995
and scare people who drive by?

00:54:51.204 --> 00:54:52.870
That sounds better.

00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:55.200
I'm going to turn around
on the count of three.

00:54:55.208 --> 00:54:59.105
- One, two... - Three!

00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:01.640
- Turn it around. Come on.
- You're not stopping me?

00:55:01.648 --> 00:55:03.580
Be brave. I'm ready to die.

00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:05.210
Let's go, Yukgwang.

00:55:05.218 --> 00:55:07.150
Come on, Yukgwang. Turn around!

00:55:07.154 --> 00:55:08.720
- What are you doing? - Turn around!

00:55:08.722 --> 00:55:10.550
- Turn around! - One, two...

00:55:10.557 --> 00:55:12.150
Three!

00:55:12.159 --> 00:55:15.285
- You're driving me crazy. - Turn around!

00:55:17.331 --> 00:55:19.025
My goodness.

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.635
Yukgwang, wait.

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:30.609
Do you see that tree?

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:32.510
- That tree over there. - Yes.

00:55:32.512 --> 00:55:35.180
That's where we found Priest Choi's body.

00:55:35.182 --> 00:55:38.775
But don't you think we
should do this at night?

00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.550
People might see us during the day.

00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:42.980
And doesn't your power
get stronger at night?

00:55:42.989 --> 00:55:46.620
Do you think I'm some rose
that blossoms at night?

00:55:46.626 --> 00:55:48.260
That doesn't matter.

00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:50.860
What are you doing? Pick up your stick.

00:55:50.864 --> 00:55:52.360
Are you really a shaman?

00:55:52.366 --> 00:55:54.295
You get scared so easily.

00:55:54.568 --> 00:55:56.569
It's not that.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.070
You're fine because you
can't see spirits anymore.

00:55:59.072 --> 00:56:03.909
But I can see them with my own
eyes, and it's more scarier.

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.475
Okay.

00:56:06.079 --> 00:56:07.805
Let's begin then.

00:56:07.914 --> 00:56:12.375
I've seen spirits my whole life
and I'm still not used to it.

00:56:27.534 --> 00:56:31.295
The grave of the spirit

00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:35.665
A mountain full of sorrow

00:56:35.709 --> 00:56:40.675
What a mournful spirit

00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:44.750
My tears are flowing endlessly

00:56:44.751 --> 00:56:48.185
And my clothes are getting wet

00:56:48.722 --> 00:56:52.190
The East Wind blows and the sun sets

00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:55.625
And I sing mournfully

00:56:56.696 --> 00:57:02.595
And put down all my long concerns

00:57:02.736 --> 00:57:05.630
The living come to light

00:57:05.639 --> 00:57:07.565
And the dead...

00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:19.275
What's wrong, Yukgwang?

00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:28.555
I can't see it.

00:57:29.162 --> 00:57:30.795
It's blocked.

00:57:32.065 --> 00:57:33.695
It's blocked.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:45.035
Yukgwang.

00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:47.475
What's wrong?

00:57:48.315 --> 00:57:49.875
Yukgwang.

00:57:50.684 --> 00:57:52.975
Why? Do you see something?

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.425
Yukgwang. What is it? Tell me.

00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.795
Yukgwang, what did you see?

00:58:07.801 --> 00:58:09.495
What is it?

00:58:13.907 --> 00:58:16.465
It's a body...

00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:24.149
- What is it this time?
- It's another body.

00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:26.280
This week is a total mess.

00:58:26.286 --> 00:58:28.645
- How many bodies is it? - Hey, misters.

00:58:29.022 --> 00:58:30.655
Misters.

00:58:30.757 --> 00:58:32.455
What are you looking at?

00:58:32.993 --> 00:58:35.425
Don't mess around while
you're being investigated.

00:58:36.196 --> 00:58:37.795
Sir.

00:58:38.532 --> 00:58:40.465
Look into my eyes.

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:43.060
What is there to be suspicious about me?

00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:44.800
You smell of suspicion.

00:58:44.804 --> 00:58:46.400
It's suspicious that you
went to a crime scene...

00:58:46.406 --> 00:58:48.835
and found another dead body.

00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:50.740
Why did you go there?

00:58:50.744 --> 00:58:54.179
This boy seems normal
when you first see him,

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:55.710
but he has a psychic ability.

00:58:55.715 --> 00:58:58.780
So I went there to perform exorcism.

00:58:58.785 --> 00:59:01.285
Why did you dig the ground with your hands?

00:59:01.354 --> 00:59:04.050
Sir, that's just our job.

00:59:04.057 --> 00:59:06.350
We seem perfectly normal,

00:59:06.359 --> 00:59:08.390
but we suddenly feel something...

00:59:08.395 --> 00:59:10.725
and start seeing things.

00:59:10.764 --> 00:59:12.090
Sometimes if we dig the ground,

00:59:12.098 --> 00:59:15.625
we find old artifacts used by
ancient shamans, you know.

00:59:15.902 --> 00:59:18.365
- But this time we found a body. - Right.

00:59:19.172 --> 00:59:22.300
We didn't know. We had no idea at all.

00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:25.170
I think that location is the problem.

00:59:25.178 --> 00:59:28.180
As soon as we went there, spirits
started to stick to our bodies.

00:59:28.181 --> 00:59:29.240
Isn't that true?

00:59:29.249 --> 00:59:31.180
So whose remains was it?

00:59:31.184 --> 00:59:32.910
There was a name tag when we found it.

00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:34.545
My goodness.

00:59:34.588 --> 00:59:36.589
That's none of your business. Stop asking.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.150
It's because his psychic ability...

00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:41.120
sometimes turns into curiosity.

00:59:41.127 --> 00:59:42.790
When did this person die?

00:59:42.796 --> 00:59:45.325
Is it related to the body
that was found here before?

00:59:51.237 --> 00:59:53.770
The body belongs to a girl who
went missing 20 years ago.

00:59:53.773 --> 00:59:55.170
She's a high school student, Sung Hyeon Ju.

00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:57.970
We concluded that she ran away from home.

00:59:57.978 --> 00:59:59.140
Are you certain...

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.610
that it's this girl?

01:00:01.615 --> 01:00:04.049
Yes. We need to run some more tests,

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:06.275
but the items that were
found have been confirmed.

01:00:07.454 --> 01:00:11.120
And she was discovered right next
to where that priest was found.

01:00:11.124 --> 01:00:13.690
The reporters are asking whether
this is a related case.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.755
The timing is similar too.

01:00:25.171 --> 01:00:27.865
I lost my appetite after
seeing a dead body.

01:00:28.008 --> 01:00:29.735
You seem to eat fine.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:31.770
Take that grain of rice
off your right cheek.

01:00:31.778 --> 01:00:33.505
Why are you so clumsy?

01:00:36.249 --> 01:00:38.875
It's supposed to be a lucky mole.

01:00:39.486 --> 01:00:42.545
Who are you trying to reach?

01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:44.650
- Give it to me. - Gosh.

01:00:44.658 --> 01:00:46.685
Detective Kang?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.690
- Is something going on? - Give it to me.

01:00:48.695 --> 01:00:51.725
I'm still single, you know.

01:00:52.265 --> 01:00:55.165
Why isn't she picking up? I
just need to ask her something.

01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:01.635
Yun Hwa Pyung, that little...

01:01:02.308 --> 01:01:05.170
Yun Hwa Pyung, why do you keep calling?

01:01:05.178 --> 01:01:07.745
Who am I? I'm Gil Young's older brother.

01:01:07.814 --> 01:01:10.680
Will you stop bothering her?

01:01:10.684 --> 01:01:12.480
- Hello? - Do you understand?

01:01:12.485 --> 01:01:14.045
Give it to me.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:17.485
Yes? What's the matter?

01:01:22.362 --> 01:01:24.490
I'm investigating in Gyeyangjin
regarding Priest Choi.

01:01:24.497 --> 01:01:26.055
What is it?

01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.725
Did you find anything?

01:01:31.971 --> 01:01:33.539
A dead high school girl?

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.370
Yes. Please look into it.

01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:37.370
She was found close to Priest Choi's body.

01:01:37.377 --> 01:01:39.740
She went missing about 20 years ago.

01:01:39.746 --> 01:01:41.180
It was around the same time.

01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:42.480
Isn't something fishy?

01:01:42.482 --> 01:01:44.945
It might have something
to do with Park Il Do.

01:01:45.085 --> 01:01:47.720
The girl's name is Song Hyeon Ju.

01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:49.150
Hold on.

01:01:49.155 --> 01:01:51.120
- Song Hyeon Ju? - You know her?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.420
At that time, the police assumed
she just ran away from home.

01:01:53.426 --> 01:01:55.220
No. She went missing.

01:01:55.228 --> 01:01:57.725
It was a weird case. She just disappeared.

01:01:57.764 --> 01:01:58.960
You know a lot.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:00.999
Is it because you're from this town?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.300
No.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.895
It was my mom's last case.

01:03:39.966 --> 01:03:41.725
"Park Hong Joo".

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.065
Congresswoman...

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.800
Park Hong Joo.

01:04:21.808 --> 01:04:24.135
- You must be hungry. - I am.

01:04:24.844 --> 01:04:26.640
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

01:04:27.647 --> 01:04:29.810
Eat a lot. You must be hungry.

01:04:29.816 --> 01:04:31.350
- Eat a lot. - Thank you.

01:04:31.351 --> 01:04:33.645
Please say something.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.750
I've always been concerned about...

01:04:38.758 --> 01:04:40.520
what people in need eat.

01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:43.360
I'm very happy that I could
help these people...

01:04:43.363 --> 01:04:45.860
through Sharing Hands.

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:48.700
Let's take a picture before we wrap up.

01:04:48.701 --> 01:04:50.325
Okay.

01:04:51.371 --> 01:04:53.330
Will you hold hands?

01:04:53.339 --> 01:04:54.965
Sure.

01:05:01.748 --> 01:05:03.545
Like this.

01:05:22.735 --> 01:05:26.035
- Song Hyeon Ju? - Yes.

01:05:26.072 --> 01:05:29.105
I thought I should let you know right away.

01:05:29.409 --> 01:05:31.505
Why are you telling me this?

01:05:31.577 --> 01:05:32.910
Sorry?

01:05:32.912 --> 01:05:37.005
Why are you telling me this?

01:05:37.617 --> 01:05:39.415
Do whatever you want.

01:05:42.322 --> 01:05:44.355
Gosh!

01:06:56.162 --> 01:06:57.460
Even if the statute of
limitations has expired,

01:06:57.463 --> 01:06:59.260
we have to find who killed her.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.530
She's a congresswoman.

01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:02.730
We have no chance.

01:07:02.735 --> 01:07:04.230
I've met a witness.

01:07:04.237 --> 01:07:06.870
He threw a fit after seeing
Park Hong Joo's photo.

01:07:06.873 --> 01:07:09.500
She didn't react to the
cross or the prayers.

01:07:09.509 --> 01:07:11.670
It would have been impossible
if she was possessed.

01:07:11.677 --> 01:07:14.540
Let's say it's Park Il Do. How
are you going to catch him?

01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:17.710
While we were sitting
back, more people died!

01:07:17.717 --> 01:07:20.780
If you kill possessed people, how
are you different form a demon?

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.485
I'll put an end to Park
Il Do with all my might.
