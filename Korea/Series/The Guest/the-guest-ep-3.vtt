00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:25.940
He should be killed.

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.795
I've become certain of my
belief for the first time.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:36.735
Over there.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.475
Hey, what about my mom?

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:43.375
Mom, no!

00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:50.285
I heard you wandered
around, driving a taxi.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.785
Yes. I was looking for someone.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:55.430
He was moved to the drain
after being killed.

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.940
The drain is dry, but his body is wet.

00:00:57.941 --> 00:00:59.600
I have a strange ability.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.525
I was sleeping last night,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.280
and I suddenly saw the killer
leave the body in the drain.

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:05.625
Are you kidding me?

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:11.020
How did this man meet Park Il Do?

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.180
Where is Park Il Do?

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.920
He came from the ocean.

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:19.060
Park Il Do!

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:20.675
How did you know that?

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:22.175
How did you know he would poke his eyes?

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:23.730
I said I could see...

00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.530
what possessed people do.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.600
Park Il Do is in Priest
Choi's body, isn't he?

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:29.715
Priest Choi's little brother.

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:31.800
- His family died because of you. - Sir!

00:01:31.808 --> 00:01:34.240
You made him an orphan.

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:35.510
I won't do it anymore.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.510
Both the man and the girl might die.

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:38.810
I'll do it from now.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.310
Please send Satan and demons...

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:42.980
and chase them away from this world.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:46.220
Everyone who stays near him will die.

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:48.605
You are the same as us.

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:50.405
What were you doing?

00:01:50.594 --> 00:01:52.805
I was just reacting to the possessed man.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.315
Tell me your name!

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:59.815
Park Il Do!

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.485
Please call Detective Kang Gil Young.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.625
Kim Young Soo will tell her
where his daughter is.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.155
Did you eat today?

00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:45.625
Yes.

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:48.435
You can eat food now.

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:52.765
Since the exorcism,

00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:57.875
have you ever heard strange things?

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.735
Don't you see anything
like the illusions...

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.275
you saw last time?

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:54.535
I don't see...

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:57.405
anything.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.445
It seems you're not possessed anymore.

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:09.615
My daughter...

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.085
Soo Jin.

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:19.185
I heard your daughter is in the hospital.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.455
You'll see her soon.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.985
Hello, sir.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.085
Did you sleep in the night-duty room again?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.100
Go home for a change.

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:53.895
I have to come to work anyway.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.095
Did you hear about Kim Young Soo?

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.025
The prosecution didn't indict him.

00:04:59.983 --> 00:05:03.335
- Really?
- They say he's unfit for the crime.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.135
They told us to re-investigate the case.

00:05:05.288 --> 00:05:08.875
I really don't understand
what this case is about.

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:10.675
You saw Kim Young Soo, right?

00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:13.429
He was totally different from
when he was being interrogated.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.960
He can't even talk properly now...

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:17.085
and cries and looks for his family.

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:27.795
Don't be so afraid of your dad.

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.465
He won't act strangely now.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.525
Was it Dad...

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:37.405
who did that to my mom?

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:40.105
Well...

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.505
I know it's hard to understand,
but your dad didn't do it.

00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:46.729
He was possessed by something evil.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.415
I know things like that well.

00:05:48.832 --> 00:05:50.515
Your dad did nothing wrong.

00:05:52.202 --> 00:05:53.515
You don't believe me, do you?

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.855
I was possessed by something
like that before too.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.955
So I did something bad to my family.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.325
But...

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.255
I don't remember.

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:07.265
Your dad is probably the same as me.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.435
He's under pain and is
suffering more than anyone.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.935
You should go meet your dad later.

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.445
Okay?

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:33.895
Have you eaten?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.275
I thought you would buy me
something fancy, but noodles?

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.835
Don't eat then.

00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:53.505
I'm eating!

00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:56.275
You have a temper.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.300
You're single, right?

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:00.815
All men will run away from you.

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:03.955
My kid is in sixth grade.

00:07:04.841 --> 00:07:07.409
His education expenses are killing me.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.055
Really? I got divorced twice.

00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:14.035
This conversation is boring.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:16.995
You're the one who started it.

00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:22.275
Just eat your noodles.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:24.159
I've been a regular since I was a rookie.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.605
This place is the best around here.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.755
Rock-paper-scissors.

00:07:42.245 --> 00:07:43.655
I'll be right back.

00:07:52.422 --> 00:07:55.875
You even smile. I thought you
were a grumpy old detective.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.645
- Do you want to get beaten up?
- No, ma'am.

00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:03.415
What will happen to Kim Young Soo?

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:06.445
He won't be indicted and released.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.715
I'll re-investigate him
and send him to jail.

00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:12.625
But it's not Kim Young Soo's fault.

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:16.455
He did kill someone, so
he needs to be punished.

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:18.595
The victims need to see justice.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.265
He lost his wife.

00:08:22.819 --> 00:08:25.565
He's just a victim that was
possessed by an evil spirit.

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:31.045
I don't know about spirits
or whatever it is.

00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:34.615
These types of cases are
the most difficult for me.

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.215
People die, and we can't
even solve the case.

00:08:39.903 --> 00:08:43.255
Goodness. This is tough for me too.

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:46.285
I wish Sohn just possesses the bad guys.

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:49.895
What on earth is that? Sohn?

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:55.695
It's when a person is
possessed by a spirit.

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:58.435
That's what we call it in my hometown.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.065
We say, "Sohn is coming."

00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.445
So that thing came to Kim Young Soo?

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.505
And that's why he acted strangely?

00:09:06.796 --> 00:09:08.645
Park Il Do is a superior spirit.

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:11.745
Park Il Do controls inferior spirits.

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:14.385
And inferior spirits possess human beings.

00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:17.015
When I was young,

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.640
I was possessed by Park Il Do.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:22.225
That's why you can see strange things?

00:09:22.946 --> 00:09:24.225
Yes.

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:27.865
Park Il Do has possessed
someone else right now.

00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.065
And it keeps killing people.

00:09:30.119 --> 00:09:31.605
Did you see the case file?

00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:33.465
I did.

00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:36.735
But I'm not sure.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.405
Park Il Do.

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.715
We must catch that Park Il Do.

00:09:47.604 --> 00:09:49.415
An evil spirit...

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.595
I'll just catch criminals
that I can see with my eyes.

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:01.335
And besides that,

00:10:02.418 --> 00:10:04.705
there are so many evil people...

00:10:05.622 --> 00:10:07.065
in this world already.

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:15.915
Were you involved in a serious
incident in the past?

00:10:17.567 --> 00:10:19.715
I can read people as soon as I see them.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:21.585
I told you I'm psychic.

00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.085
Forget it. Let's go.

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:37.465
- Thank you for the meal. - Bye.

00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:43.195
You really won't go to the hospital?

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:46.880
You know that won't help.

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:48.375
I told you.

00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:52.475
An exorcist priest meets
evil things all the time.

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:56.245
My body and soul become weak and fall ill.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:11:59.815
Then you should stop working.

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:02.585
You've gotten too old.

00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:06.285
Would it kill you to say politely?

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:10.455
If I hadn't become a priest, I
would've had a son your age.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.065
I feel pity for that son already.

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.205
That's true though.

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:19.835
But...

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.075
who would do something like
this if it wasn't for me?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.599
What about you? It's not too late to quit.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.485
I already told you.

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:35.555
I have someone to find.

00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:47.665
Can't you clean up in here?

00:12:47.884 --> 00:12:49.535
Open the windows once in a while.

00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:52.820
This is why you're sick.

00:12:52.822 --> 00:12:55.935
Since you're here, can you
do the laundry for me?

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.245
- I have to go. - Come on.

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:01.815
Take your medicine.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.845
Too bad.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:06.545
Would it kill you to do the laundry?

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.695
How did you find me?

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.395
The parish council gave me this address.

00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:25.180
You're quite the detective.

00:13:25.188 --> 00:13:27.575
I'm good at things like that.

00:13:28.491 --> 00:13:32.075
I came to thank you for
what you did last time.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.875
There's no need.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.685
I'm just finishing up what
Priest Han was doing.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.570
If you're packing his
stuff, I'll help you out.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.295
You'll be nothing but a distraction.

00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:49.655
Please just leave.

00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:54.765
How cold.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.575
About Priest Han...

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.975
It's funny I say this,

00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:10.675
but I hope you don't blame yourself.

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:13.385
That's what Priest Han would want as well.

00:14:13.703 --> 00:14:15.915
What if I say I blame you?

00:14:16.339 --> 00:14:19.185
I'm a big part of it. You're right.

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:24.395
But wouldn't he forgive me?

00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:28.595
Both he and I risked our lives for this.

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:32.665
I could die tomorrow as well.

00:14:33.222 --> 00:14:35.935
You're so self-centered.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.605
It's all about you saving everyone...

00:14:39.362 --> 00:14:41.145
and you risking your life.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:43.475
Are you criticizing me now?

00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:46.715
Why do you talk casually to me?

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.649
You've been doing that from the beginning.

00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.085
You can talk casually too if you want.

00:14:54.443 --> 00:14:55.955
Fine.

00:14:56.779 --> 00:14:58.595
I'm leaving, Father.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.735
During the last exorcism,

00:15:06.455 --> 00:15:09.675
the superior spirit that controlled
Kim Young Soo disappeared.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.875
Did you do something?

00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:16.675
As superior spirits lose their
power, inferior spirits get weak.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:20.285
I learned it from my experience.

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:22.955
Park Il Do.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.955
Right. That thing called Park Il Do.

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:29.855
That's the one that killed Priest Han.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.665
Where is it?

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:34.735
Park Il Do.

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:41.505
It's been possessing someone's
body for the past 20 years.

00:15:41.891 --> 00:15:43.435
I'm looking for it too.

00:15:45.928 --> 00:15:47.475
I'll let you know when I find it.

00:15:55.938 --> 00:15:59.225
Everyone who stays near him will die.

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:02.825
He is just like us.

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.165
That taxi driver guy.

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:07.965
He provoked something very dangerous.

00:16:09.652 --> 00:16:11.035
Mateo.

00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:13.465
You shouldn't be involved.

00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:25.960
Hey, you brat. Is that your car?

00:16:25.968 --> 00:16:28.670
You had to at least tell me
before you took the car.

00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:32.025
Well, I can't take a taxi.
Mine belongs to the company.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.961
Make sure you fill the tank full afterward.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.270
Or you can bring a plateful
of sashimi back to Seoul.

00:16:36.278 --> 00:16:38.695
Sashimi? Your neighborhood is
full of sashimi restaurants.

00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:42.235
I'm not going near any beach. I
don't even want to look at it.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:45.620
By the way, why are you
suddenly heading there?

00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.880
You don't like to go there.

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:48.935
When Kim Young Soo was possessed,

00:16:49.058 --> 00:16:51.945
he said Priest Choi will soon
come to his little brother.

00:16:52.628 --> 00:16:54.129
His little brother? Why?

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.075
I should go check myself.

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:25.505
You didn't say you were coming.
What brings you here?

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.060
What's that car?

00:17:28.064 --> 00:17:29.990
Did you make some money?

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:31.685
I borrowed it.

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:33.645
I knew it.

00:17:35.371 --> 00:17:37.415
I'm hungry. Give me some food.

00:17:42.711 --> 00:17:44.379
It was humid and hot this morning.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.140
Tomorrow is going to be hot as well.

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:47.240
It will be very sunny and...

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:50.435
How old is the television? It even works.
Impressive!

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:52.365
I told you to get a new one.

00:17:52.521 --> 00:17:54.089
I don't have time for television.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.235
I'm busy with the farm and the fishery.

00:17:57.693 --> 00:17:59.205
Are you there?

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.160
Ozone is invisible, but...

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.615
Who is it?

00:18:03.399 --> 00:18:04.999
Let's have a drink.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.745
I brought some fish.

00:18:08.637 --> 00:18:10.015
Well...

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.670
There will be no rain this week.

00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:13.840
I can't. I have a guest.

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:14.909
Who is it?

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:18.179
The fine dust level dropped
from bad to normal.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.495
Hello.

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:22.935
Hello. It's you.

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:25.680
All right. Then let's take a rain check.

00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:27.720
There have been about 400 cases...

00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:30.590
since the ozone warning system has started.

00:18:30.593 --> 00:18:32.320
It's the highest record.

00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:35.990
- Gosh. - According to the research,

00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:39.700
compared to when there was no
heat wave, the ozone warning...

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.385
He looked at me as if he saw a ghost.

00:18:41.437 --> 00:18:44.470
The neighbors and relatives
must be still afraid of me.

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:46.185
Never mind.

00:18:46.675 --> 00:18:50.010
You won't even have thieves in this house.

00:18:50.012 --> 00:18:51.379
They are too scared of me.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.440
Don't you think?

00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:54.410
Yes, you're right.

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:56.950
Besides, there are more
volatile organic compounds...

00:18:56.952 --> 00:18:59.220
that evaporated in the air,

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:02.035
which increase ozone pollution.

00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:05.505
To decrease ozone density...

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.035
What are these scars?

00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:32.980
He did it to himself.

00:19:32.988 --> 00:19:35.475
He did it to himself with his own force.

00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:01.935
What are you doing up?

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.005
When you are old,

00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:12.705
you don't sleep much.

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:15.775
And why did you come out?

00:20:16.899 --> 00:20:18.385
It's too hot.

00:20:24.139 --> 00:20:27.625
Don't wait for him. He's not coming back.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.865
I wonder where your father
is and what he's doing.

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:36.135
I wonder if he doesn't starve himself.

00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:42.635
He called you just once and that was it.

00:20:44.693 --> 00:20:46.905
Don't wait for him.

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:28.585
Grandpa.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:37.510
Run!

00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:38.925
Grandpa!

00:22:26.028 --> 00:22:29.790
Hey, where are you going
so early in the morning?

00:22:29.798 --> 00:22:31.130
I have to go somewhere.

00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.500
What about breakfast?

00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.755
I don't eat breakfast. I'm leaving.

00:22:35.003 --> 00:22:36.615
Hey, wait.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.925
Take this.

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.795
- Fill up the tank with this. - Come on.

00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:45.240
- I make good money too. - Just take it.

00:22:45.247 --> 00:22:46.695
I'll call you later.

00:23:00.062 --> 00:23:01.415
Oh, my.

00:23:01.897 --> 00:23:03.675
When did he bring this?

00:23:04.433 --> 00:23:06.585
What a waste of money.

00:23:09.838 --> 00:23:13.125
It would have been nicer if
he had set this up for me.

00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:39.100
Wait. Please wait.

00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:41.269
Mom

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.670
- Stay away. - Mom.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.415
Mom, no!

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.525
Mom!

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.880
Can I help you?

00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:38.645
Well... I'm looking for someone
who used to live here.

00:24:39.161 --> 00:24:40.775
Someone who lived here?

00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:44.785
I don't know where he is either.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:46.600
A relative came and took him...

00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:48.230
as soon as he went to high school.

00:24:48.237 --> 00:24:50.215
He hasn't visited since.

00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:51.755
You don't have his number?

00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:56.055
I think he changed his number.
I couldn't reach him.

00:24:57.179 --> 00:25:00.410
Didn't he have any close
friends from this place?

00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:02.049
Or from his school?

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.010
He didn't have any friends.

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:05.705
He didn't even talk to anyone.

00:25:05.821 --> 00:25:07.765
He was traumatized or something.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.490
Anyway, he didn't say a word like a mute...

00:25:11.493 --> 00:25:13.105
and stayed alone in his room.

00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:15.975
He was also bullied at school, and...

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:22.255
Why? Did something happen?

00:25:24.139 --> 00:25:26.125
He attempted suicide.

00:25:26.475 --> 00:25:29.870
After that, he went to the
hospital for treatment...

00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:31.678
and went to the police
for the investigation.

00:25:32.915 --> 00:25:34.725
I was so stressed because of him.

00:25:35.183 --> 00:25:37.995
That young kid was so spiteful.

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:43.750
So are you covering that murder
case from a long time ago?

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:45.660
What newspaper are you from?

00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:49.390
Oh, we're preparing an article
about past murder cases...

00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:51.130
that are yet to be solved.

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.345
Rather than that...

00:25:56.872 --> 00:26:00.055
Has this man ever come here?

00:26:02.244 --> 00:26:05.495
That priest has never come here.

00:26:05.948 --> 00:26:07.295
I see.

00:26:07.382 --> 00:26:09.895
His older brother was a priest too, right?

00:26:09.918 --> 00:26:11.295
He killed his parents...

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.165
Maybe it's because of his brother.

00:26:15.223 --> 00:26:16.705
He seemed a bit...

00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:18.275
What?

00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:22.975
He gave me the creeps sometimes.

00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:25.285
All the other students were scared of him.

00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:28.515
He even talked to himself sometimes.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.970
A dog we raised at the orphanage died,

00:26:30.973 --> 00:26:32.455
and everyone was crying,

00:26:32.774 --> 00:26:36.395
but he stared at the dead dog
expressionlessly for a long time.

00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:38.965
The priest is...

00:26:39.414 --> 00:26:43.035
on his way to...

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:48.675
his little brother!

00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:31.645
Detective Kang, please listen to me.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:33.745
Come on, just a second.

00:27:35.103 --> 00:27:37.200
It's an abduction and murder. Two girls...

00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:39.385
I told you I don't believe such things.

00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.540
A woman was dead inside a trunk.

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:43.225
I saw it clearly.

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:45.395
You still don't believe me?

00:27:45.547 --> 00:27:47.510
You saw what happened with
the Kim Young Soo case.

00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:50.780
Whatever. A case like that wasn't reported.

00:27:50.786 --> 00:27:52.735
That's because the body
hasn't yet been found.

00:27:52.788 --> 00:27:54.905
The killer keeps the bodies
inside his car trunk.

00:27:59.494 --> 00:28:01.360
This is driving me crazy.

00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:04.630
Then can you check for any missing persons?

00:28:04.633 --> 00:28:05.930
A short-haired girl in her early 20's.

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:06.930
She has a flower tattoo on her shoulder.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.330
She's wearing jeans and a white shirt.

00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:11.385
It was so vivid that I feel
like I saw it with my own eyes.

00:28:19.014 --> 00:28:20.325
What are you doing?

00:28:20.982 --> 00:28:22.465
Why are you here again?

00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:26.735
Detective Kang left something
behind in my taxi.

00:28:27.656 --> 00:28:30.320
Are you following Detective Kang?

00:28:30.325 --> 00:28:31.845
- Sorry? - What?

00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:35.045
Gosh, you have an odd taste...

00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:40.015
Right. She does look attractive.

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.900
Still, if you get on her nerves,
she'll beat you to death.

00:28:42.904 --> 00:28:44.385
Go home, I'll call you.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.585
You must call me, okay?

00:28:46.675 --> 00:28:49.625
- In her early 20's... - And short-haired.

00:28:50.345 --> 00:28:51.865
Jeans and a white shirt.

00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:54.495
And a small flower tattoo on her shoulder.

00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:04.305
- There's no hit. - Really?

00:29:07.596 --> 00:29:08.860
That's a relief.

00:29:08.864 --> 00:29:10.845
Is this because of a case?

00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:12.615
No, never mind.

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.015
A small flower tattoo on her shoulder?

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.325
We received a report today.

00:29:21.676 --> 00:29:23.670
Her name is Kim Eun Soo, 25 years old.

00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:25.510
Wearing a white shirt and jeans.

00:29:25.514 --> 00:29:28.365
And she has a flower
tattoo on her shoulder.

00:29:59.014 --> 00:30:00.840
Yes, did you check?

00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:03.280
You were right. She is missing.

00:30:03.285 --> 00:30:05.335
Where did she go missing?

00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:08.720
She was last seen with a
friend late at night...

00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:11.235
two days ago in Hantan-dong.

00:30:11.626 --> 00:30:13.120
Her family couldn't reach her...

00:30:13.128 --> 00:30:14.945
and reported her missing today.

00:30:15.297 --> 00:30:18.090
She probably caught a taxi. The
taxi driver is the killer.

00:30:18.099 --> 00:30:20.245
I checked the security cameras nearby.

00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:23.330
There's no footage of her getting
in a taxi, and we lost track of it.

00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:26.955
- What are you going to do?
- I have to search nearby.

00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:30.540
But this is tough, since it's not my case.

00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:31.910
Let's do it together. I'll help.

00:30:31.913 --> 00:30:35.695
Hey, forget it. You're going
to make a mess like last time.

00:30:36.418 --> 00:30:38.750
Are you already poking
around here and there?

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:41.180
What are you talking about? I'm working.

00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:43.505
It's difficult to make a living lately.

00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:46.275
Okay, you better not try anything.

00:30:46.494 --> 00:30:47.775
Okay.

00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:10.110
I'm sick of the same menu.

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:12.380
- What do you want to eat today?
- Let's eat anything.

00:31:12.387 --> 00:31:14.735
Let's eat and hurry back.

00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:25.345
Where were you?

00:31:26.935 --> 00:31:28.515
I was looking into things.

00:31:29.404 --> 00:31:30.600
What's wrong with him?

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:32.570
You don't know? It's
because you irritated him.

00:31:32.574 --> 00:31:33.600
What did I do?

00:31:33.608 --> 00:31:36.770
You found out that Kim Young
Soo's daughter was alive.

00:31:36.778 --> 00:31:38.255
He was opposed to it.

00:31:38.413 --> 00:31:40.695
He's embarrassed and angry at you.

00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:42.565
I'd feel the same way if I were him.

00:31:44.286 --> 00:31:47.480
Why can't he just say something to my face?

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.305
Watch that mouth of yours.

00:31:49.557 --> 00:31:51.475
Come on. Join us for lunch.

00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:54.575
We're having a team dinner tonight.

00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.190
You should have a drink with us...

00:31:56.197 --> 00:31:57.590
and butter up to the boss.

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:59.115
Why should I do that?

00:31:59.668 --> 00:32:02.885
That's what we all do. Is there
something wrong with that?

00:32:03.104 --> 00:32:05.185
Forget it. I already said hi.

00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:07.740
I have to go. There's some
stuff I need to look into.

00:32:07.742 --> 00:32:09.040
What are you up to lately?

00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:12.110
Someone has been reported
missing, and it seems suspicious.

00:32:12.113 --> 00:32:14.140
Are you making up cases
that haven't yet occurred?

00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:16.065
You're a workaholic.

00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:20.035
You're not even coming to dinner
and becoming a loner in our team.

00:32:22.924 --> 00:32:27.075
I mean, you're not trying to
get along with the others.

00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:30.660
Go and enjoy buttering up to our boss.

00:32:30.665 --> 00:32:32.215
Don't speak like that.

00:32:32.434 --> 00:32:34.445
I'm going to make you a loner.

00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:39.355
- Bong Sang, don't be upset. - Whatever.

00:32:47.515 --> 00:32:49.680
Excuse me.

00:32:49.684 --> 00:32:51.310
Have you seen a taxi...

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:53.735
that has a stuffed monkey
on its rear-view mirror?

00:33:08.203 --> 00:33:09.600
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

00:33:09.604 --> 00:33:11.200
but have you seen a taxi
that has a stuffed monkey...

00:33:11.206 --> 00:33:13.055
on its rear-view mirror?

00:33:13.308 --> 00:33:14.885
No, I haven't.

00:33:15.043 --> 00:33:17.825
Do you see that surveillance
camera out there?

00:35:01.382 --> 00:35:02.995
To Bongin-dong please.

00:35:46.194 --> 00:35:48.345
Sir, why are you going this way?

00:35:48.663 --> 00:35:50.675
You should've turned right.

00:36:13.755 --> 00:36:15.305
Where are you going?

00:36:18.793 --> 00:36:22.375
What was that? You were
dozing, weren't you?

00:36:22.564 --> 00:36:24.975
You passed it.

00:36:29.804 --> 00:36:31.715
I'm sorry, but please get off here.

00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:35.155
- What? - I won't charge you. Just get off!

00:37:02.303 --> 00:37:04.485
Sir, why are you going this way?

00:37:17.518 --> 00:37:21.565
Darn it. Where is it? Where has it gone to?

00:38:26.954 --> 00:38:28.335
I'm sorry.

00:38:36.798 --> 00:38:38.075
Are you okay?

00:38:38.266 --> 00:38:41.045
I was dozing off for a second.

00:38:47.175 --> 00:38:48.525
What is he doing?

00:38:54.849 --> 00:38:56.165
That little...

00:39:34.756 --> 00:39:35.920
Hey!

00:39:35.923 --> 00:39:37.535
That stupid jerk...

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:22.775
Darn it.

00:41:42.116 --> 00:41:43.465
Dang!

00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:03.385
- I found it. - Found what?

00:42:03.804 --> 00:42:05.185
The culprit.

00:42:06.173 --> 00:42:09.425
His car is right here.

00:42:28.863 --> 00:42:30.245
You stupid jerk.

00:42:30.865 --> 00:42:32.345
Who are you?

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:34.815
Where is Park Il Do?

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.898
Hwa Pyung.

00:43:38.899 --> 00:43:43.404
You punk. I told you to be careful.

00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:45.873
My goodness.

00:43:47.408 --> 00:43:50.977
All right. I get it. Stay still.

00:43:50.978 --> 00:43:54.915
You'll hurt yourself.

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:59.453
You have to stay still.

00:44:00.688 --> 00:44:05.326
Hey! When are you going to pay me back?

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.597
You should have been careful.

00:44:10.197 --> 00:44:11.565
What are you doing?

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.502
I'm sorry.

00:44:14.835 --> 00:44:18.105
My brother is dying.

00:44:19.807 --> 00:44:21.542
What are you doing?

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.211
I'm sorry.

00:44:24.345 --> 00:44:25.613
Gosh.

00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:27.682
Do you know him?

00:44:30.117 --> 00:44:31.518
It wasn't you?

00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:34.321
Why do you bother an injured person?
His condition seems serious.

00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:40.127
Are you okay?

00:44:40.695 --> 00:44:42.796
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:44:42.797 --> 00:44:44.932
I thought...

00:44:47.068 --> 00:44:48.436
Mr. Yun.

00:44:48.669 --> 00:44:50.437
You need a thorough check-up.

00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:52.406
It's okay. My brain is okay.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.608
Do you think you're made of steel?

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:58.578
If you keep doing this,
you might drop dead.

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.346
Please be more careful.

00:45:00.347 --> 00:45:02.115
That's not important right now.

00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:04.485
- Did you call the detective? - I did.

00:45:05.086 --> 00:45:06.454
There she comes.

00:45:09.156 --> 00:45:10.624
What were you saying on the phone?

00:45:11.058 --> 00:45:12.393
You found the culprit?

00:45:14.028 --> 00:45:15.395
Did you get hurt?

00:45:15.396 --> 00:45:16.964
The culprit hurt me.

00:45:17.364 --> 00:45:19.366
I found a dead woman in his trunk.

00:45:20.067 --> 00:45:23.069
That taxi driver kidnaps and murders women.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.504
Did you really see it?

00:45:24.505 --> 00:45:25.873
Do you have evidence?

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.285
You can find the culprit by
looking up his car, right?

00:45:38.986 --> 00:45:40.621
That's a fake taxi.

00:45:40.888 --> 00:45:42.757
The plate number must be fake too.

00:45:43.357 --> 00:45:46.694
Please find him by all means, will you?

00:45:47.428 --> 00:45:49.196
He got away before my very eyes.

00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:51.966
If I had been just a little
faster, she would have lived.

00:45:54.468 --> 00:45:56.137
I see there was an accident.

00:45:58.239 --> 00:46:00.719
But it doesn't prove that he
kidnapped and murdered the woman.

00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:03.644
I saw her dead body.

00:46:04.378 --> 00:46:05.646
You don't believe me?

00:46:07.948 --> 00:46:09.617
She has a flower tattoo on her arm.

00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:12.685
You know she's been missing!

00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:15.989
You don't want to get involved
because it's a tricky case?

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:17.825
What?

00:46:18.826 --> 00:46:21.494
Why do both of you lose temper so easily?
Calm down.

00:46:21.495 --> 00:46:24.265
He's already killed three people!

00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:27.167
I need your help.

00:46:27.168 --> 00:46:29.703
Otherwise, he'll kill more people.

00:46:35.409 --> 00:46:36.777
Gosh, this is killing me.

00:46:38.279 --> 00:46:40.147
Where are we?

00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:42.783
Please drive carefully.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.485
Careful.

00:46:45.486 --> 00:46:47.187
Gosh. What's with you?

00:46:47.188 --> 00:46:49.255
You know I've recently
had a hemorrhoidectomy.

00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:52.927
Why are you doing this to me?

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.995
Why are we going to the junkyard?

00:46:55.429 --> 00:46:57.797
I told you it's about an illegal taxi.

00:46:57.798 --> 00:46:59.533
The license plate has expired too.

00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:02.368
But we're not from the traffic department.

00:47:02.369 --> 00:47:04.905
What does it have to do
with violent crimes?

00:47:05.506 --> 00:47:07.874
Someone personally reported to me.

00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:10.044
Who? Illegal taxi...

00:47:10.377 --> 00:47:11.946
Taxi?

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.815
What was the name of that taxi driver?

00:47:15.816 --> 00:47:18.886
It's Yun something. Did he report to you?

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.291
By the way, what's going on
between you two? Tell me.

00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:25.893
Are you seeing each other?

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.894
Are you?

00:47:27.895 --> 00:47:30.196
I'm right, aren't I? That's
why you can't say anything.

00:47:30.197 --> 00:47:31.264
You just admitted it.

00:47:31.265 --> 00:47:32.465
What are you talking about?

00:47:32.466 --> 00:47:35.235
Please drive carefully.

00:47:35.236 --> 00:47:36.704
It hurts.

00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:51.185
You should do another driving test.

00:47:58.826 --> 00:48:00.593
This car has already been scrapped.

00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:01.962
What about the license plate?

00:48:02.229 --> 00:48:04.331
It must have been scrapped too.

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:06.566
Did you scrap it yourself?

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:09.103
No. Someone else is in charge did.

00:48:09.737 --> 00:48:11.372
What's the matter?

00:48:11.438 --> 00:48:13.173
Can I talk to the person in charge?

00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:14.742
Sure.

00:48:16.577 --> 00:48:18.846
Hey. Where is Min Gu?

00:48:19.747 --> 00:48:21.848
- You haven't seen him?
- He was here a moment ago.

00:48:21.849 --> 00:48:23.417
- He was? - Yes.

00:48:23.617 --> 00:48:25.753
Is he sleeping somewhere again?

00:48:27.288 --> 00:48:29.989
- When did you last see him?
- About 10 minutes ago.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.325
- 10 minutes ago? - Yes.

00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:33.394
Gosh.

00:48:33.928 --> 00:48:35.462
Where on earth did he go?

00:48:45.706 --> 00:48:48.142
- What's wrong? - This is the one.

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:54.815
Are you sure?

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:03.824
Why? Where are you going?

00:49:23.177 --> 00:49:24.545
Stop there!

00:49:30.317 --> 00:49:31.885
Who are you?

00:49:31.919 --> 00:49:33.954
- Why did you run away? - Stop it.

00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:36.589
Stop it!

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.458
Stop!

00:49:38.459 --> 00:49:40.461
What are you doing to my brother?

00:49:40.594 --> 00:49:42.428
Stop!

00:49:42.429 --> 00:49:45.064
- Stop! - Look at me.

00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:47.634
- Stop! - It's okay.

00:49:48.168 --> 00:49:49.936
- Stop! - It's okay.

00:49:49.937 --> 00:49:53.039
- Stop! - Calm down.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.676
Stop!

00:49:58.078 --> 00:49:59.513
Choi Min Gu.

00:50:00.147 --> 00:50:01.782
Why did you run away earlier?

00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:09.856
According to your brother,

00:50:09.857 --> 00:50:12.593
you're in charge of
scrapping license plates.

00:50:13.594 --> 00:50:14.895
Is that right?

00:50:22.336 --> 00:50:24.505
Hey. Choi Min Gu.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.120
- What did you do last night?
- An appointment.

00:50:29.376 --> 00:50:31.345
I have an appointment.

00:50:31.979 --> 00:50:33.313
What appointment?

00:50:34.548 --> 00:50:37.251
I don't want to talk to a woman.

00:50:39.486 --> 00:50:40.954
Do you like soccer?

00:50:41.488 --> 00:50:42.855
My mom didn't let me watch soccer games...

00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:44.524
and use the Internet.

00:50:44.525 --> 00:50:46.226
So I called and complained.

00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:51.097
I should've beat harder...

00:50:51.098 --> 00:50:53.766
like my mom did to me.

00:50:53.767 --> 00:50:55.368
What is he rambling on about?

00:50:55.369 --> 00:50:57.104
I think that's why.

00:50:57.905 --> 00:51:00.107
That jerk came yesterday!

00:51:07.047 --> 00:51:08.916
That's because I called.

00:51:11.518 --> 00:51:12.785
That's because I called.

00:51:12.786 --> 00:51:14.655
I should've beat harder...

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.857
like my mom did to me.

00:51:17.858 --> 00:51:19.426
Have you ever seen this girl?

00:51:27.568 --> 00:51:28.836
Come with me.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.817
What are you doing with him right now?

00:51:44.818 --> 00:51:46.086
Are you interrogating him?

00:51:46.987 --> 00:51:48.454
Please pretend you don't know anything.

00:51:48.455 --> 00:51:51.091
I thought you were after an illegal taxi.

00:51:51.558 --> 00:51:54.127
According to his brother,
that boy can't drive.

00:51:54.128 --> 00:51:57.164
- He doesn't even have a license.
- We never know.

00:51:57.397 --> 00:51:58.866
Please be honest.

00:51:58.899 --> 00:52:00.366
What was the picture of the girl?

00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:02.136
Something happened, right?

00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:08.775
Well... I mentioned that...

00:52:09.009 --> 00:52:10.476
I was looking into some
missing person cases, right?

00:52:10.477 --> 00:52:12.045
I think they're serial missing cases.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.816
I'm suspecting the culprit
drives an illegal taxi.

00:52:16.917 --> 00:52:18.385
Serial missing cases?

00:52:18.919 --> 00:52:20.253
Has there been any report?

00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:22.856
Yes. But it's not about a missing person.

00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:25.025
Then?

00:52:26.727 --> 00:52:28.462
It might be a kidnap and murder case.

00:52:29.296 --> 00:52:30.764
There's a witness.

00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:32.766
Who?

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.703
Are you talking about that taxi driver?

00:52:38.238 --> 00:52:39.639
At 1am last night,

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.608
he saw a dead body in the culprit's trunk.

00:52:42.609 --> 00:52:45.145
He said that he saw a dead body?

00:52:45.946 --> 00:52:49.183
If he's telling the truth,
we've got the third victim.

00:52:49.716 --> 00:52:51.185
But nothing is certain yet.

00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:53.954
Exactly. Nothing is certain.

00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:55.956
So send that boy back home.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.157
We already have a bad name
after the Kim Young Soo case.

00:52:58.158 --> 00:53:01.762
You can't do this without
reporting to the team manager.

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.097
We have the Bokmin-dong special
robbery and rape case.

00:53:05.098 --> 00:53:07.334
Let's solve that first, okay?

00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:15.007
He acts just like the culprit
from our previous case.

00:53:15.008 --> 00:53:17.443
Gosh, this doesn't feel right.

00:53:17.444 --> 00:53:19.012
Just send him back home.

00:53:36.196 --> 00:53:39.966
This is going well.

00:53:39.967 --> 00:53:41.335
There you go.

00:53:41.868 --> 00:53:43.203
And then...

00:53:44.938 --> 00:53:47.274
All right.

00:53:50.077 --> 00:53:51.345
Yukgwang.

00:53:56.049 --> 00:53:57.351
Gosh.

00:53:58.185 --> 00:53:59.486
Yukgwang.

00:54:01.555 --> 00:54:03.523
I can't move my body.

00:54:05.259 --> 00:54:07.494
Yukgwang! Look at me!

00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:30.644
You...

00:55:32.646 --> 00:55:34.081
You...

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.585
Gosh, you startled me.

00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.320
What's wrong?

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:43.456
Did you have a night terror?

00:55:43.457 --> 00:55:44.991
Did you see something?

00:55:45.659 --> 00:55:46.927
I did.

00:55:47.694 --> 00:55:49.496
I saw a spirit.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:51.932
What kind?

00:55:52.966 --> 00:55:54.334
The powerful one.

00:55:55.068 --> 00:55:56.403
Park Il Do.

00:55:56.737 --> 00:55:58.472
Where?

00:56:00.173 --> 00:56:01.441
There.

00:56:01.708 --> 00:56:05.112
- He was right there. - Hey.

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:07.080
Hey.

00:56:07.647 --> 00:56:09.316
Is he still there?

00:56:09.616 --> 00:56:11.284
Is he?

00:56:13.887 --> 00:56:15.255
Gosh.

00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:23.930
I pray to my ancestral spirits

00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:26.466
Please scare away evil spirits

00:56:30.537 --> 00:56:32.706
Gosh, what are you doing?

00:56:36.076 --> 00:56:38.311
Sleep at your place from now on.

00:56:38.345 --> 00:56:39.879
You're attracting spirits.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.816
You're bringing all kinds of spirits here.

00:56:43.417 --> 00:56:45.786
I don't want you to ruin my business.

00:56:45.886 --> 00:56:47.421
Sleep at your place.

00:56:48.455 --> 00:56:50.456
Gosh, stop it.

00:56:50.457 --> 00:56:52.092
The salt is getting in my ears!

00:56:52.959 --> 00:56:54.294
Gosh.

00:56:54.528 --> 00:56:55.896
What is it?

00:56:57.764 --> 00:56:59.866
- It's her. - Who is it?

00:57:11.077 --> 00:57:12.446
You found him?

00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:14.447
You said you can see
things through spirits.

00:57:14.448 --> 00:57:16.016
What's the last thing you saw?

00:57:16.116 --> 00:57:17.983
Any characteristics of the victim,

00:57:17.984 --> 00:57:19.718
when and where she got in the taxi...

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.154
What?

00:57:21.555 --> 00:57:24.090
I'll tell you. Just tell
me where he is first.

00:57:25.158 --> 00:57:26.893
- I can't. - Why not?

00:57:27.727 --> 00:57:29.895
If the third woman turns
out to be the same person,

00:57:29.896 --> 00:57:31.364
the police will work on it.

00:57:31.898 --> 00:57:33.966
Don't interfere with our investigation...

00:57:33.967 --> 00:57:35.535
like the last time.

00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:38.004
Without a dead body, you can't
start an investigation.

00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:39.905
By the time the police gets involved,

00:57:39.906 --> 00:57:41.807
there will be more victims already.

00:57:41.808 --> 00:57:43.477
- What? - Forget it.

00:57:43.577 --> 00:57:45.011
I'll find him myself.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.947
You'll never be able to find that car.

00:57:47.948 --> 00:57:49.683
Only the police can.

00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:53.553
You'll never find it.

00:57:59.125 --> 00:58:00.393
Gosh.

00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:03.395
Hwaseon-dong intersection, 12:30am,

00:58:03.396 --> 00:58:05.397
a young woman with short hair,
leopard patterned clothes.

00:58:05.398 --> 00:58:08.034
Check all the security
cameras and witnesses.

00:58:08.468 --> 00:58:09.836
Where is he?

00:58:17.544 --> 00:58:19.112
One Two Junkyard in Yuseon-dong.

00:58:34.528 --> 00:58:35.795
Is this the junkyard?

00:58:36.963 --> 00:58:39.065
- Let's go. - Hold on.

00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:41.434
I don't feel good about this.

00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.104
Gosh, I'm going to die
early because of you.

00:58:45.105 --> 00:58:47.306
Why did you come with me then?

00:58:47.307 --> 00:58:50.442
Last time I sent you
alone, you hurt your head.

00:58:50.443 --> 00:58:51.945
How could I send you alone again?

00:58:52.445 --> 00:58:55.447
You're the only person who cares about me.

00:58:55.448 --> 00:58:57.083
Cut it out.

00:58:57.117 --> 00:58:58.918
I just don't want you to die
alone somewhere far away...

00:58:58.919 --> 00:59:00.686
and cause me trouble.

00:59:00.687 --> 00:59:03.723
- I should take this with me.
- What's that?

00:59:03.957 --> 00:59:06.725
A peach branch that
reaches towards the east.

00:59:06.726 --> 00:59:08.995
If I hit the guy on the back with this,

00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:11.164
evil spirits will react.

00:59:12.098 --> 00:59:14.734
I hope you're right. Let's go.

00:59:17.003 --> 00:59:18.405
Gosh.

00:59:31.785 --> 00:59:34.754
- Welcome. - Hello.

00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:39.725
I need to replace the condenser.
For my air conditioner.

00:59:39.726 --> 00:59:42.428
This place is famous among
journalists for having good parts.

00:59:42.429 --> 00:59:45.632
We have all kinds. Some
are from foreign brands.

00:59:45.665 --> 00:59:47.033
- Really? - Yes.

00:59:47.667 --> 00:59:49.134
I need to replace my fender too.

00:59:49.135 --> 00:59:51.605
- Can I look around a bit? - Sure.

00:59:51.638 --> 00:59:52.973
Thanks.

01:00:00.213 --> 01:00:01.615
See if anyone looks suspicious.

01:00:44.457 --> 01:00:46.926
What are you going to do?

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:50.196
She wouldn't accept my present.

01:00:50.697 --> 01:00:53.233
That's why I couldn't give it to her.

01:00:56.436 --> 01:00:58.104
Is fishing fun?

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.710
Excuse me.

01:01:07.013 --> 01:01:09.182
You're working so hard in this heat.

01:01:12.318 --> 01:01:13.953
What are you listening to?

01:01:19.826 --> 01:01:21.294
You little punk.

01:01:22.328 --> 01:01:24.664
It's you, right?

01:01:25.965 --> 01:01:27.333
You little punk.

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:51.023
He's recently changed, hasn't he?

01:01:51.024 --> 01:01:53.125
The way he speaks and sees
things have become weird.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:54.493
Why are you doing this?

01:01:54.494 --> 01:01:56.895
Demons play with humans' weaknesses.

01:01:56.896 --> 01:01:58.997
Your past would be too dangerous.

01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:01.867
The spirit that moved from me
to someone else. Park Il Do.

01:02:01.868 --> 01:02:03.068
I have to catch him.

01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:06.138
If he was possessed, he'd
react to the hidden cross.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.006
This case is not related to spirits.

01:02:08.007 --> 01:02:09.675
I shouldn't have believed that nonsense.

01:02:09.676 --> 01:02:11.044
Don't ever call me again.

01:02:11.077 --> 01:02:13.912
You'll never find him.

01:02:13.913 --> 01:02:17.050
He's going to die now!
