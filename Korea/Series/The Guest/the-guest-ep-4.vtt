00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:25.270
He said Priest Choi will soon
come to his little brother.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:27.665
His older brother was a priest too, right?

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.310
He gave me the creeps sometimes.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.380
It's an abduction and murder.

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:39.989
A woman was dead inside a trunk.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.320
A short-haired girl in her early 20's.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.420
She has a flower tattoo on her shoulder.

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.075
She's wearing jeans and a white shirt.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:46.560
She probably caught a taxi. The
taxi driver is the killer.

00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:48.160
Have you seen a taxi...

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:50.515
that has a stuffed monkey
on its rear-view mirror?

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.525
Do you see that surveillance
camera out there?

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:57.370
I checked the surveillance cameras nearby.

00:00:57.374 --> 00:01:00.295
There's no footage of her getting
in a taxi, and we lost track of it.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.360
It's the third person already!

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:25.785
The black car...

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:28.155
It's Park Il Do.

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:29.900
You can find the culprit by
looking up his car, right?

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:31.855
You have to help me.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:34.265
Or else, he will kill someone again.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.565
- What? - This car.

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:45.980
You found him?

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:47.089
Where is he?

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.675
One Two Junkyard in Yuseon-dong.

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:54.715
Hello.

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:00.055
You're working hard in this hot weather.

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:04.955
What song are you listening to?

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:22.245
You jerk.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.845
It's you, right?

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:26.645
Right?

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.085
Put that down.

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:35.655
What are you doing?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.435
What?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.110
Have you heard of people being possessed?

00:02:48.118 --> 00:02:49.950
Are you saying he's been
possessed by a spirit?

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:51.905
Who are you people?

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.575
Sir. Actually, our work...

00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:57.845
is related with religious matters.

00:02:58.195 --> 00:02:59.590
When I saw him,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.530
I noticed his energy was drained...

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.900
and he was suffering spiritually.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.230
We just want to help him.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:10.439
We have studied religion intensively...

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.355
- and our priest...
- What is this magazine?

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:16.210
What is this place?

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:17.540
It's none of your business.

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:19.240
- I told you to get out. - Wait.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.865
Why are you getting so angry?

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.305
It's because he's acting
really strangely, isn't it?

00:03:24.588 --> 00:03:26.305
Didn't he change suddenly?

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:28.975
He speaks gibberish with strange eyes.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:31.875
Who are you people?

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:33.606
Do you believe in false
religion or something?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.115
Get out now!

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:36.785
If you leave him like that,

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.785
it's dangerous.

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:40.285
He's right.

00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:42.985
Should I call the police?

00:03:43.406 --> 00:03:46.640
No, there's no need. We'll leave now.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:47.870
I'm sorry.

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:50.365
Come on, let's go.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.795
Goodbye.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.505
Stop making a fuss.

00:03:57.787 --> 00:03:59.705
- Let's go. - Wait.

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:03.045
Goodness.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.175
I think he is possessed.

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.999
We have to persuade that guy in there.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.285
That way we can call an exorcist priest.

00:04:13.403 --> 00:04:15.155
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:17.970
I won't do it. No, I can't do it.

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:20.925
Didn't you see me bleeding last time?

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.840
Just keep a good eye on him.

00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:26.110
I have somewhere to go.

00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:28.365
Alone? Where are you going?

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:31.035
There's someone I must meet.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.050
Watch him carefully.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.845
He might wander around and abduct women.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:38.775
Hey. He doesn't kill men, does he?

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.860
You better come back before sunset. Okay?

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.130
Gosh, all right. Just keep an eye on him.

00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:46.485
Okay.

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:49.585
My goodness.

00:05:13.963 --> 00:05:15.385
Wait. Stop there.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:18.185
Oh, it's her.

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:21.685
- Do you know her? - Yes.

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:23.085
She's pretty.

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.140
She always comes and
buys jelly for her kids.

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:27.765
Did she use a credit card?

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:29.995
A credit card?

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:33.365
She didn't come to work today.

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:36.105
- She didn't even call? - No.

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:38.505
It's her first time missing
work without calling.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:40.675
But why is the police interested in her?

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.485
Mrs. An Yoo Mi?

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:58.855
It's the police.

00:06:06.483 --> 00:06:08.210
Are you inside?

00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:10.535
I know that you're inside.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.475
I'm from the police.

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.575
Mrs. An Yoo Mi!

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.860
The police?

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.430
Are you really from the police?

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.185
Yes, I'm a policewoman.

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.015
Is Mrs. An Yoo Mi home?

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:29.055
Can you open the door?

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:39.965
I'm really a policewoman.

00:06:41.017 --> 00:06:43.065
Is Mrs. An Yoo Mi inside?

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:48.075
An Yoo Mi? She's my mom.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.530
Where is your mom?

00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:56.060
She's not here.

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:58.555
She didn't come home last night.

00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:06.095
Did you call her?

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:07.440
She didn't call you either?

00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:09.210
I can't reach her.

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.465
She's not like this normally.

00:07:13.716 --> 00:07:16.310
Is there anyone else or an adult inside?

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.580
No.

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.675
Mom's friend dropped by earlier.

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.160
Did something happen to my mom?

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:28.090
No, it's nothing.

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:29.485
Don't worry.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.200
Yes, Bong Sang.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.300
Where are you this time? Get over here.

00:07:36.306 --> 00:07:38.495
We found the suspect for armed
robbery in Bokmin-dong.

00:07:45.815 --> 00:07:48.980
Open up, you jerk. There's nowhere to go!

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:50.650
Open up right now!

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:52.305
This is frustrating.

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:54.175
Open up!

00:07:54.657 --> 00:07:56.390
Open up this instant!

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:58.420
You jerk, open this door!

00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:00.115
Open it!

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.590
What happened?

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:03.799
We almost caught him and
were chasing him...

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.185
but he went in here.

00:08:05.702 --> 00:08:06.900
- Move over. - Open it.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.655
- Open the door. - Open it.

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.440
Hey, move over. Move.

00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:13.840
I'll just kick it open.

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:15.465
Come on!

00:08:16.813 --> 00:08:18.665
- Hey. - Goodness.

00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:20.780
Hey, wait.

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:22.365
Drop that knife.

00:08:23.052 --> 00:08:25.580
- Drop the knife.
- There's no need for that.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:27.920
You're just adding to your list of crimes!

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.305
- Hey! - Get over here.

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:32.160
- Hey! - Where is he going?

00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:34.190
Stop him!

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:35.545
Hey!

00:08:42.572 --> 00:08:44.325
My goodness.

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:46.740
Hey, don't even think about it.

00:08:46.743 --> 00:08:49.165
Go down and check. Go!

00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:57.205
Are you angry?

00:08:57.353 --> 00:08:59.035
Yes, I am.

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:01.975
Why are you so reckless?

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:04.845
I had to catch him. That
jerk even committed rape.

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:08.160
But you could've gotten
yourself seriously injured.

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:11.055
Are you going to quit your job
after catching him or something?

00:09:12.735 --> 00:09:14.325
If you're finished, I must get going.

00:09:14.938 --> 00:09:16.685
Where are you going this time?

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.555
Why are you so busy?

00:09:18.575 --> 00:09:21.195
Are you investigating
that illegal taxi again?

00:09:21.878 --> 00:09:23.910
I just confirmed the third victim.

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:26.810
She didn't come home, and
left her sick daughter alone.

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.710
Whenever you see a case,

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:31.280
you run head first recklessly
like a mad person.

00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:32.820
You beat up bad guys...

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.545
How could you call yourself a good...

00:09:35.692 --> 00:09:38.060
Well, I admit you are a good detective.

00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:40.060
But we have to stick to the principles.

00:09:40.063 --> 00:09:42.330
We have no victim and no
one even reported it.

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.160
There's someone who saw the dead body.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.055
Who? That crazy dude, Yun whatever?

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.870
The way I see it, he seems more suspicious.

00:09:49.872 --> 00:09:51.540
Look at the Kim Young Soo case.
How could he be...

00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.325
in two murder cases?

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:55.140
He chased after an illegal taxi...

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:56.710
and found a dead body inside the trunk?

00:09:56.713 --> 00:09:58.095
Doesn't that sound strange?

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.510
I'm sure there's a good
reason he's saying that.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.920
A good reason my butt.

00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:06.580
Don't even get involved with him.

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:09.705
I'll check his background for you.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:12.745
If you're not going to help,
I'll take care of it alone.

00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:15.415
Hey.

00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:18.155
Kang Gil Young!

00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:20.060
What if it's true?

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:21.870
That means women are being
killed at this moment!

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.825
What if it's not? What if our
boss finds out about this?

00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:26.525
What then?

00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:30.565
Gil Young.

00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:32.765
You're not going to stop, are you?

00:10:32.815 --> 00:10:34.165
No.

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:42.345
Do whatever you want, idiot!

00:10:42.425 --> 00:10:45.345
My goodness! There's nothing
I can do about you.

00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:47.445
I hate you!

00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:50.645
Even my wife hates you!

00:10:50.867 --> 00:10:53.130
This is unbelievable.

00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:54.555
Darn it.

00:10:57.373 --> 00:10:59.440
Hey, wait. Don't leave me here.

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:02.495
Don't go! Wait for me!

00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:12.905
Who came to see me?

00:11:13.189 --> 00:11:14.575
It's him.

00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:27.055
I can't believe you remembered me.

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:30.285
You were just a kid back then.

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:33.125
Have you...

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.565
ever heard about Priest Choi Sang Hyun...

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.365
after that incident?

00:11:41.317 --> 00:11:42.350
Why do you ask?

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:44.175
I'm looking for Priest Choi.

00:11:45.088 --> 00:11:46.505
Actually,

00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.105
I'm looking for the spirit
that used to possess me.

00:11:49.425 --> 00:11:51.445
I'm looking for Park Il Do.

00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:00.185
No.

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:03.055
I haven't heard about him since then.

00:12:03.773 --> 00:12:07.195
I quit being an exorcist
priest after that incident.

00:12:10.613 --> 00:12:12.840
Do you know anyone who can
help in finding Park Il Do?

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:14.505
Let's stop talking about that.

00:12:15.051 --> 00:12:16.735
When you become my age,

00:12:19.756 --> 00:12:22.405
you tend to forget awful
memories like that.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.785
You have something to ask about our group?

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:31.985
Yes.

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:36.900
Do you know the brothers who run
a junk yard in Yuseon-dong?

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:38.640
Brothers who run a junk yard...

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:39.900
Oh, yes.

00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:42.525
Sharing Hands was supporting them.

00:12:42.745 --> 00:12:43.940
What's this about?

00:12:43.946 --> 00:12:46.210
I think the younger brother has
been possessed by Park Il Do.

00:12:46.215 --> 00:12:47.565
What?

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:51.835
Are you certain?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.020
Did you check properly?

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:56.705
He's showing symptoms.

00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:58.445
And I have proof.

00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:01.345
Really?

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.355
There was a problem before...

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:07.555
What problem?

00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:10.895
He was abused when he was a kid.

00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:13.225
By his mom.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:18.565
He gained personality disorder
and even attempted suicide.

00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:20.280
He attempted suicide?

00:13:20.283 --> 00:13:22.505
I recommended therapy to him.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.220
The doctor diagnosed that
he was afraid of women...

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.505
and that he hated them.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.675
Now I understand why he
goes after women only.

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:35.790
What do you plan to do?

00:13:35.798 --> 00:13:37.315
I have to perform exorcism.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.655
Why would you do something like that?

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.425
The devil plays around with
the weakness of human beings.

00:13:44.974 --> 00:13:47.309
Your past will have a serious effect.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.565
It's because of Park Il Do.

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:51.965
I must catch it.

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:55.235
I have one more question.

00:13:55.718 --> 00:13:57.335
Do you know where...

00:13:58.054 --> 00:13:59.805
Priest Choi's brother is?

00:14:01.157 --> 00:14:02.490
Why do you ask?

00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:05.120
I met someone who was
possessed by Park Il Do.

00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:06.545
He said...

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:09.060
that Priest Choi will go to his brother.

00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:10.445
Priest Choi...

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.825
will go to his...

00:14:14.904 --> 00:14:19.500
brother!

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:21.025
That's what he said?

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.565
Why?

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:24.565
Why would he go to his brother?

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:25.995
I don't know.

00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:29.765
Maybe he might try to
kill his brother again.

00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:33.735
Is there a reason...

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.775
why Priest Choi must kill his brother?

00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:43.215
I don't know.

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:45.355
An evil spirit...

00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:49.200
reaches into a person's deepest mind.

00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:52.295
There might have been simple
hatred or jealousy between them.

00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:55.625
It's easy for the devil to
take advantage of that.

00:14:58.915 --> 00:15:02.965
How was the relationship between
the junk yard brothers?

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.435
They were close. But...

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.875
The little brother once told me this.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.215
When their mom beat them,

00:15:13.429 --> 00:15:15.130
his older brother ran away.

00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.315
He was too young and weak...

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:19.655
and his mom always caught and beat him.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.395
He said that's why he hates
his brother as well.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:34.935
When one came out, she hit the one.

00:15:35.785 --> 00:15:37.775
And when another one came out,

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.935
she hit that one.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.120
When I told Mom that I needed coins,

00:15:44.126 --> 00:15:45.515
Min Gu.

00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:49.115
Darn it. What was I supposed to do?

00:15:50.566 --> 00:15:52.985
I had to give her two bills...

00:15:53.436 --> 00:15:54.930
to get out of the house.

00:15:54.937 --> 00:15:56.285
Min Gu.

00:15:57.139 --> 00:15:58.555
Enough.

00:15:58.908 --> 00:16:00.625
- These days, you are... - Hey.

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.135
Why did you do that then?

00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:10.765
Why did you do that?

00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:14.605
Why did you do that? Why?

00:16:15.257 --> 00:16:17.605
You ran away alone.

00:16:18.427 --> 00:16:22.115
I got caught. She pulled my hair,

00:16:22.131 --> 00:16:24.815
whipped me with a belt, and...

00:16:36.645 --> 00:16:39.010
You brat! You deserve death!

00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:42.865
You're not even my son! Die! Die! Die!

00:16:59.468 --> 00:17:00.985
I'm here!

00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:05.295
Are you okay?

00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:07.695
I've been watching everything.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.235
We will help you.

00:17:12.982 --> 00:17:14.365
Okay.

00:17:21.724 --> 00:17:23.105
Recently,

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.575
he has changed for sure.

00:17:25.795 --> 00:17:27.990
Was there a trigger?

00:17:27.997 --> 00:17:29.445
Well...

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:34.085
For the first time, Min Gu said
he had a crush on someone.

00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:37.100
He had been following her,

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:38.670
but she hated him.

00:17:38.674 --> 00:17:41.025
So of course she rejected him.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.165
I think he has become strange since.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.535
Who is she?

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.310
She used to work in a cafe in the downtown,

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.005
but I can't see her these days.

00:17:58.094 --> 00:17:59.515
Hey.

00:18:00.362 --> 00:18:02.145
A detective came to our place.

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:04.885
Did he do something bad?

00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:08.255
Please just listen to what I say for now...

00:18:08.771 --> 00:18:10.585
if you want to help your brother.

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:14.770
Who is it?

00:18:14.777 --> 00:18:17.165
It's the police who came earlier.

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:24.875
Have you eaten something?

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:28.220
Here you are.

00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:33.145
Do you know...

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:35.985
any of your relatives
or your mom's friends?

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.895
I told you not to open the door.

00:18:45.574 --> 00:18:47.695
Mom is back home.

00:18:51.814 --> 00:18:53.795
The woman is alive!

00:18:58.454 --> 00:19:00.075
Please excuse me for a second.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360
Who?

00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:07.790
The woman you said was the third victim.

00:19:07.796 --> 00:19:09.545
She's alive in one piece.

00:19:09.865 --> 00:19:11.530
That's not possible.

00:19:11.534 --> 00:19:13.230
Are you sure she's the
one who took the taxi?

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.269
I checked that too.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.070
She took the taxi, but nothing happened.

00:19:17.072 --> 00:19:18.840
That can't be true. I saw her.

00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:21.125
She was lying in the trunk
with her hands tied.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.940
- I wasn't sure if she was dead...
- That's enough.

00:19:22.945 --> 00:19:24.895
I was stupid to have believed you.

00:19:25.014 --> 00:19:26.740
Nothing has ever happened.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:30.265
There was no kidnap and
no murder like you said.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.880
I told you. I can see everything.

00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:35.420
I also checked the first victim.

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:37.375
- Min Go had a crush on... - Enough.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.815
And...

00:19:39.929 --> 00:19:41.515
never contact me again.

00:19:43.499 --> 00:19:46.155
Hello. Hello?

00:19:55.878 --> 00:19:57.395
Did something happen?

00:19:57.913 --> 00:19:59.295
No.

00:19:59.582 --> 00:20:01.665
The police is useless.

00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:07.975
So?

00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:10.945
- I need your help. - I can't.

00:20:11.994 --> 00:20:13.615
There are three already.

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:16.815
There are three victims already.

00:20:17.099 --> 00:20:19.555
We should hurry exorcize the spirit.

00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:22.325
I said I can't.

00:20:22.605 --> 00:20:23.600
We need to follow the process.

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:26.325
Stop talking about the process.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.995
It's his little brother.

00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:31.595
He could die like last time.

00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:34.135
My brother is an innocent man.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.235
Please help him.

00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:54.569
You brat.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.870
I told you to make sure you
come back before sunset.

00:20:57.873 --> 00:20:59.740
- Is he inside? - Of course.

00:20:59.742 --> 00:21:01.740
He's in the office.

00:21:01.744 --> 00:21:03.595
My ears hurt.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.880
I'm leaving now.

00:21:07.883 --> 00:21:09.265
Where are you going?

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:13.520
If it doesn't work out, you should do it.

00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:16.775
I can't today. I can't.

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:20.090
I have a very important appointment.

00:21:20.095 --> 00:21:21.929
I have my life.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.730
You always have important appointments.

00:21:24.733 --> 00:21:27.315
I'm asking because you're like my family.

00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:30.525
Family, my foot.

00:21:31.073 --> 00:21:33.255
Close your eyes and focus.

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:35.195
Gosh.

00:21:39.448 --> 00:21:43.410
Good spirits shall be caught by life.

00:21:43.419 --> 00:21:46.905
Evil spirits shall be caught by death.

00:21:54.196 --> 00:21:55.615
It's all set.

00:21:56.765 --> 00:21:59.360
I closed your spirit gate.

00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:01.500
So just take care of your body.
You know what I mean, right?

00:22:01.503 --> 00:22:02.670
All right. Thank you.

00:22:02.671 --> 00:22:05.055
Good. Now I'm leaving.

00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:08.395
Good job.

00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:12.910
Shall we? Are you ready?

00:22:12.915 --> 00:22:14.435
Is there anything you need?

00:22:15.184 --> 00:22:16.705
No.

00:22:16.919 --> 00:22:18.535
Just make sure to not be in the way.

00:22:19.688 --> 00:22:23.545
Goodness. Look at how rude he is. Let's go.

00:22:53.322 --> 00:22:54.875
Let me see your hand.

00:23:26.288 --> 00:23:27.735
Hey! What's wrong?

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:32.475
He's not possessed.

00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:35.745
Are you saying that was not a spirit?

00:23:35.964 --> 00:23:37.345
You saw it.

00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:41.015
If he was possessed,

00:23:41.537 --> 00:23:44.185
he would have reacted to the hidden cross.

00:23:45.107 --> 00:23:46.955
He's a patient.

00:23:47.443 --> 00:23:49.395
I've seen many people before...

00:23:49.878 --> 00:23:52.518
who hallucinate, hurt themselves,
and have multiple personalities.

00:23:52.815 --> 00:23:54.855
I visited those who were
suspected to be possessed,

00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:58.875
but what they needed was psychotherapy.

00:24:00.322 --> 00:24:02.875
He's not possessed. He's ill.

00:24:03.792 --> 00:24:05.245
He is possessed.

00:24:05.494 --> 00:24:06.915
He has a spirit in him.

00:24:07.296 --> 00:24:08.815
I saw it.

00:24:09.998 --> 00:24:11.060
You saw it?

00:24:11.066 --> 00:24:13.155
I can see...

00:24:13.335 --> 00:24:15.970
when the one possessed by Park
Il Do is about to commit murder.

00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:17.330
I can't see all of it though.

00:24:17.339 --> 00:24:19.670
It seems like you need a
psychotherapy as well.

00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:22.365
You don't have to believe
me if you don't want to,

00:24:22.578 --> 00:24:24.740
but if we let him like that,
another person will be killed.

00:24:24.746 --> 00:24:26.595
Just leave it to the police.

00:24:27.616 --> 00:24:29.665
This is not a possession.

00:24:30.986 --> 00:24:32.875
I say it is!

00:24:36.692 --> 00:24:38.759
What other proof do you need?

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.715
What is it? What else do you need?

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.945
Are you still upset?

00:25:43.425 --> 00:25:45.245
Men don't get upset.

00:25:46.061 --> 00:25:48.485
Goodness. Shut your mouth and eat.

00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:50.615
How could I eat with my mouth shut?

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.715
You must be kidding me.

00:25:55.537 --> 00:25:58.255
It's better not to talk with you.
I always get angry.

00:26:01.343 --> 00:26:02.570
Stop being mad at me.

00:26:02.578 --> 00:26:04.525
I quit looking into that case.

00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:07.010
Really?

00:26:07.015 --> 00:26:09.865
Yes. I've decided not to care about it.

00:26:10.085 --> 00:26:13.280
That's great. You've finally
come to your senses.

00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:15.775
I told you that you shouldn't trust him.

00:26:15.924 --> 00:26:17.690
He got lucky last time...

00:26:17.693 --> 00:26:19.590
during Kim Young Soo's case.

00:26:19.595 --> 00:26:22.890
I think he's a total con-artist.
He's insane.

00:26:22.898 --> 00:26:26.600
He investigates cases and claims
that he solved them on the internet.

00:26:26.602 --> 00:26:29.930
He's a psychopath. No, what do you call it?

00:26:29.938 --> 00:26:32.325
He's an attention seeker.

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.609
Ma'am, can we get another bottle of soju?

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:35.965
Sure.

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:38.640
What's the occasion? You
don't usually drink.

00:26:38.647 --> 00:26:40.235
It's for you.

00:26:40.282 --> 00:26:41.880
You look really excited right now.

00:26:41.883 --> 00:26:46.380
What are you talking about?
I'm not excited at all.

00:26:46.388 --> 00:26:48.405
Ma'am, give me a cold bottle of soju!

00:26:49.558 --> 00:26:53.360
Goodness. You should stop
fussing over cases like that...

00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:55.129
and meet your friends to go clubbing...

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.885
and eat at fancy restaurants.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.585
Oh, you don't have friends, right?

00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:05.700
Gil Young, why did you stop
investigating the case?

00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:09.825
The missing woman turned out to be at home.

00:27:10.445 --> 00:27:12.565
She had to take care of something urgent.

00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:15.380
What a messed-up family.

00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:17.450
Her kid is sick at home,
and she goes out...

00:27:17.452 --> 00:27:19.805
and doesn't come home all night?

00:27:19.855 --> 00:27:21.275
It is strange.

00:27:22.758 --> 00:27:25.159
Why is it so hot in here? Isn't
there any air-conditioning?

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.645
Here is your soju.

00:27:27.829 --> 00:27:30.015
She's wearing long sleeves. My gosh.

00:27:30.298 --> 00:27:31.930
Is she trying to cover something?

00:27:31.933 --> 00:27:34.400
What if she has dragon
tattoos all over her body?

00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:37.000
It will be cool if there
were two huge dragons.

00:27:37.005 --> 00:27:38.455
Wait.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.095
What?

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:42.925
She was wearing long sleeves too.

00:27:43.912 --> 00:27:45.079
Was she covering something?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.710
That can't be true. I saw her.

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:49.135
She was lying in the trunk
with her hands tied.

00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:52.775
I have to go somewhere.

00:27:53.622 --> 00:27:55.575
Hey! Where are you going?

00:27:56.058 --> 00:27:57.505
You have to pay for this!

00:27:58.226 --> 00:28:02.045
Oh my goodness. I can't
even cancel the order.

00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:05.315
Give me your credit card!

00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.295
- What is it this time?
- Show me your wrist.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.165
I have to check something.

00:28:22.584 --> 00:28:24.135
What is this about?

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:31.845
You were abducted, right?

00:28:34.429 --> 00:28:35.785
The truth is...

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.625
He told me not to call the police.

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:45.670
He said he'd kill everyone if I did.

00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:47.425
He said he knew my address.

00:28:48.343 --> 00:28:51.935
He also took my cellphone and my ID.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.795
How did you escape?

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:12.555
There was a car accident.

00:29:12.968 --> 00:29:15.355
The car trunk was damaged and it opened.

00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:20.225
That's how I escaped.

00:30:30.512 --> 00:30:32.465
An Yoo Mi.

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:36.305
Come out!

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.645
I have your wallet and
your cellphone right here.

00:30:46.595 --> 00:30:47.945
Hey!

00:30:49.331 --> 00:30:50.945
You better not call the police.

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:53.855
I know your home address.

00:30:54.202 --> 00:30:56.025
I'll find you and kill you.

00:30:57.072 --> 00:31:00.625
I'll find all your family
members and rip them apart!

00:31:01.877 --> 00:31:04.165
Do you remember where you were?

00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:07.935
I'm not sure.

00:31:08.783 --> 00:31:10.165
I saw...

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.335
many old cars.

00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:16.075
You didn't see his face?

00:31:16.558 --> 00:31:17.975
No.

00:31:20.161 --> 00:31:22.015
I didn't look on purpose.

00:31:22.797 --> 00:31:25.885
What about his voice? Was
there anything peculiar?

00:31:26.835 --> 00:31:28.185
There was...

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.985
one strange thing.

00:31:46.788 --> 00:31:48.575
I'm going to do it more intensively.

00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:50.505
Don't stop me.

00:32:01.202 --> 00:32:02.430
Don't come near me.

00:32:02.437 --> 00:32:04.070
Don't do it!

00:32:04.072 --> 00:32:06.100
Don't do it! No!

00:32:06.107 --> 00:32:07.600
You're hurting my brother.

00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:09.165
Stop!

00:32:10.946 --> 00:32:12.535
Who are you?

00:32:12.948 --> 00:32:14.965
Tell me. Who are you?

00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:18.050
The great angel, Saint Michael.

00:32:18.053 --> 00:32:20.275
Please protect us from this fight.

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:23.350
Please protect us from the
wickedness and lies of the devil.

00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:26.475
Die, you jerk! I'm going to kill you.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.985
We ask for your holy power
to tie this demon up.

00:32:33.068 --> 00:32:34.885
We bow down and pray to you.

00:32:36.838 --> 00:32:38.725
What's happening?

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.125
The power goes out sometimes.

00:32:41.142 --> 00:32:42.925
I have a flashlight somewhere.

00:32:44.913 --> 00:32:47.110
I pray to the holy leader of the heavens.

00:32:47.115 --> 00:32:48.510
I pray that you will use your power...

00:32:48.516 --> 00:32:51.235
to kill all the demons and
evil spirits in this world...

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:54.805
and send them to the afterlife.

00:32:55.523 --> 00:32:57.045
Amen.

00:33:12.007 --> 00:33:13.395
We were wrong.

00:33:14.342 --> 00:33:16.310
He's not reacting to the prayer.
He's not possessed.

00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:17.895
What? Again?

00:33:18.813 --> 00:33:20.235
Darn it.

00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:22.335
Let me try it.

00:33:26.287 --> 00:33:28.405
Look. You know him, right?

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:31.605
Look closely. You've met him, haven't you?

00:33:40.802 --> 00:33:42.325
What's wrong?

00:33:45.507 --> 00:33:47.525
Why do you have this picture?

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.465
Do you know him?

00:33:55.917 --> 00:33:57.935
What are you doing? Where's the flashlight?

00:34:01.256 --> 00:34:02.645
It's right here.

00:34:17.672 --> 00:34:19.095
He's gone.

00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:21.455
How did he untie it?

00:34:39.127 --> 00:34:40.675
What are you doing, Choi Min Gu?

00:34:40.862 --> 00:34:42.515
Calm down and put the knife down.

00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:44.315
Put it down right now.

00:34:45.066 --> 00:34:47.785
Min Sang, go stop your brother.

00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:51.555
Calm down, Choi Min Gu.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.725
Calm down and put the knife down.

00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:57.165
Min Sang.

00:34:57.278 --> 00:35:00.295
What are you doing? Come
and stop your brother.

00:35:00.882 --> 00:35:02.335
What was strange?

00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:04.565
From the beginning,

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:10.205
he was talking to himself...

00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:12.045
as if...

00:35:13.661 --> 00:35:14.990
he was talking to someone.

00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:16.445
I got one.

00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:19.415
She seems clueless.

00:35:21.002 --> 00:35:23.555
She's much better than...

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:26.655
the woman with a flower tattoo.

00:35:27.809 --> 00:35:29.225
Do you see it?

00:35:29.277 --> 00:35:31.925
Excuse me. Sir.

00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:35.435
I'd like to just get off here.

00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:03.325
So...

00:36:07.916 --> 00:36:10.105
There was a man.

00:36:10.518 --> 00:36:13.675
There are two culprits?

00:36:19.627 --> 00:36:20.945
Min Sang.

00:36:59.701 --> 00:37:01.655
You read my thought.

00:37:02.203 --> 00:37:03.585
How was it?

00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:07.240
That blood just now...

00:37:07.242 --> 00:37:10.395
feels hot in your hand, doesn't it?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.135
Doesn't it feel nice?

00:37:18.453 --> 00:37:20.035
You brat!

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:23.775
Why are you so full of yourself?

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:38.130
Bong Sang. Come to the junkyard quickly.

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:40.655
What are you talking about? What now?

00:37:41.042 --> 00:37:42.925
Hwa Pyung was right.

00:37:43.077 --> 00:37:45.395
That woman was kidnapped.

00:37:45.647 --> 00:37:47.365
The two brothers are accomplices.

00:37:47.482 --> 00:37:48.965
Hurry up.

00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:09.785
You were right.

00:38:10.738 --> 00:38:12.600
She told me the truth.

00:38:12.607 --> 00:38:14.895
She said she got kidnapped and escaped.

00:38:16.978 --> 00:38:18.325
Hello?

00:38:23.318 --> 00:38:24.705
You...

00:38:26.287 --> 00:38:27.635
Who are you?

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:05.675
Father, you're good.

00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:08.775
When you were praying next to me,

00:39:09.897 --> 00:39:11.715
it was...

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:14.385
It was really...

00:39:15.336 --> 00:39:17.625
painful!

00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:27.965
Gosh.

00:39:28.983 --> 00:39:31.065
I feel much better now.

00:39:31.686 --> 00:39:33.075
Hey.

00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:36.105
Why do you keep following me?

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:40.775
Your grandfather will be sad...

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.285
if his only grandson dies.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.765
There we go.

00:40:04.685 --> 00:40:06.575
Now it's bright.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.060
You brat!

00:40:17.064 --> 00:40:21.630
I'll trample you to death!

00:40:21.636 --> 00:40:24.325
Just die!

00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:33.765
Where is the car to carry their corpses?

00:40:34.415 --> 00:40:35.765
Where is it?

00:40:35.817 --> 00:40:37.235
Let's go!

00:40:44.392 --> 00:40:48.275
Little brothers have to be
beaten to learn lessons.

00:40:49.897 --> 00:40:51.515
Don't you think, Father?

00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:53.855
You should have...

00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:57.700
listened to your brother as well.

00:40:57.705 --> 00:41:00.795
Then the policewoman wouldn't have died.

00:41:24.599 --> 00:41:26.055
I have a question.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.525
Are you...

00:41:31.339 --> 00:41:33.155
Father Choi's little brother?

00:41:47.688 --> 00:41:49.575
Are you Father Choi's little brother?

00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:57.445
How do you know that?

00:42:39.006 --> 00:42:40.395
I told you...

00:42:41.909 --> 00:42:45.395
not to ditch school.

00:42:47.515 --> 00:42:50.265
I told you not to ditch school.

00:42:54.889 --> 00:42:57.250
Wait! Wait!

00:42:57.258 --> 00:42:58.745
Let me ask you one question.

00:42:59.427 --> 00:43:02.275
How couldn't we notice
that you're possessed?

00:43:08.603 --> 00:43:12.125
His brother accepted us.

00:43:13.107 --> 00:43:15.965
We're one.

00:43:16.243 --> 00:43:17.965
Then what about your little brother?

00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:20.535
He's just crazy.

00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:23.835
You guys were mistaken.

00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:26.920
But thanks to that, you guys ended up here.

00:43:26.921 --> 00:43:28.505
His brother...

00:43:29.056 --> 00:43:32.305
wanted to kill everyone.

00:43:33.894 --> 00:43:35.575
Hatred.

00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:38.545
Resentment.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.655
More than the little brother.

00:43:41.969 --> 00:43:43.325
Why?

00:43:44.305 --> 00:43:45.885
Because you were abused?

00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.855
Because of your mom?

00:43:52.146 --> 00:43:53.565
Mom?

00:44:15.336 --> 00:44:16.785
Stop it!

00:44:21.509 --> 00:44:23.065
Come here.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.305
Mom.

00:44:54.208 --> 00:44:56.925
Pull up your shirts.

00:45:05.586 --> 00:45:08.605
She starved us, locked us up,

00:45:08.689 --> 00:45:10.145
and pierced us again.

00:45:12.026 --> 00:45:13.375
She beat us up.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.115
So?

00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:24.485
You killed women because of
your hatred for your mom?

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:27.155
Three women at that?

00:45:33.414 --> 00:45:34.835
No.

00:45:34.915 --> 00:45:36.765
I killed two, actually.

00:45:37.084 --> 00:45:39.065
And that little brother started first.

00:45:39.453 --> 00:45:42.075
He liked a girl,

00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:44.875
so he flirted with her.

00:45:45.059 --> 00:45:48.545
When she turned him down, he beat her.
But the thing is,

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.185
he ended up killing her.

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:54.185
His big brother saw it.

00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:56.255
That's when...

00:45:57.037 --> 00:45:58.755
we came into...

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:00.925
this guy's body.

00:46:01.842 --> 00:46:03.195
"We"?

00:46:07.114 --> 00:46:08.635
We...

00:46:10.484 --> 00:46:11.905
I...

00:46:14.155 --> 00:46:15.505
I...

00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:19.045
We...

00:46:21.028 --> 00:46:22.445
We're...

00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:25.985
one.

00:46:40.314 --> 00:46:42.635
You dirty little punk.

00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:48.075
How does it feel to peep at us every day?

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.875
Did you feel it...

00:46:51.759 --> 00:46:53.315
in your hands?

00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:58.085
The feeling of cutting someone up.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.115
Did you enjoy it?

00:47:01.669 --> 00:47:03.025
Did you?

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.155
When did you meet Park Il Do?

00:47:08.742 --> 00:47:11.025
When and where did you meet him?

00:47:11.145 --> 00:47:13.135
Isn't that why you became possessed?

00:47:23.858 --> 00:47:27.015
You'll never find him...

00:47:28.896 --> 00:47:34.085
because I'm going to kill you now!

00:47:57.191 --> 00:47:58.390
It's him!

00:47:58.392 --> 00:48:00.375
The big brother who just
went out is possessed.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:51.595
Did you find him?

00:48:51.712 --> 00:48:53.235
He got away.

00:48:53.447 --> 00:48:55.635
- Where is your car key?
- Let me come with you.

00:48:57.418 --> 00:48:58.865
How do you know?

00:48:58.919 --> 00:49:01.235
Why do you have a picture of my brother?

00:49:01.755 --> 00:49:03.875
Why did you show it to
the possessed people?

00:49:04.491 --> 00:49:05.975
I'll explain later.

00:49:12.066 --> 00:49:13.615
Where is your brother?

00:49:17.504 --> 00:49:18.955
Where is your brother now?

00:49:19.707 --> 00:49:21.570
He's not your brother right now.

00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:23.425
He might kill more people.

00:49:25.746 --> 00:49:27.235
Mom.

00:49:27.648 --> 00:49:29.735
I hate Mom.

00:49:30.751 --> 00:49:32.750
Because I hate Mom...

00:49:32.753 --> 00:49:34.120
Where is he?

00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:35.535
Hold on.

00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:37.575
Let me talk to him.

00:49:45.499 --> 00:49:47.985
You want to save your brother, don't you?

00:49:49.136 --> 00:49:50.685
Where is he now?

00:49:59.013 --> 00:50:00.465
Choi Min Gu.

00:50:01.382 --> 00:50:03.535
Who answered your phone earlier?

00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:08.250
Why?

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:10.375
The older brother, Choi Min Sang.

00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:14.420
She told me the truth.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:16.615
She said she got kidnapped and escaped.

00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:22.485
All right.

00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.700
No, I don't want it.

00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:28.955
You have to take it.

00:50:29.209 --> 00:50:31.525
It tastes too bitter.

00:50:32.012 --> 00:50:34.135
What do you want me to do?

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.105
Will you take it if I buy you candies?

00:50:42.823 --> 00:50:44.175
Yes.

00:51:07.414 --> 00:51:08.835
Thank you.

00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.425
Excuse me.

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.935
I'm sorry,

00:51:42.483 --> 00:51:44.705
but where is Yongho Elementary School?

00:51:47.621 --> 00:51:50.875
Go straight and turn right.

00:52:12.913 --> 00:52:14.280
Where is your mom?

00:52:14.281 --> 00:52:17.765
She went out to get candies.
She hasn't come home yet.

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:53.875
Do you see anything?

00:52:54.188 --> 00:52:57.145
No, I don't see anything. I
have no idea where she is.

00:53:50.277 --> 00:53:52.125
Please...

00:54:12.666 --> 00:54:14.015
You little...

00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:18.385
I said I'd kill you if you report.

00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:36.945
Too late.

00:54:55.776 --> 00:54:58.165
You little punk. Come with me.

00:54:58.845 --> 00:55:00.710
I'm taking him to the station.
What's the matter?

00:55:00.714 --> 00:55:02.265
We lost his brother.

00:55:02.416 --> 00:55:04.535
Ask the boy where his brother is.

00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:05.680
Hold on.

00:55:05.686 --> 00:55:07.580
Hey. Where's your brother right now?

00:55:07.587 --> 00:55:08.780
Where is he?

00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:09.850
I wanted to stop,

00:55:09.856 --> 00:55:13.090
but both my brother and I were scared.

00:55:13.093 --> 00:55:14.460
What are you rambling on about?

00:55:14.461 --> 00:55:16.245
Tell me where your brother is.

00:55:17.331 --> 00:55:18.785
Pull yourself together.

00:55:18.999 --> 00:55:20.515
Let me talk to him.

00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:24.755
You want to?

00:55:48.962 --> 00:55:50.415
Come here.

00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.545
Be quiet.

00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:02.195
Why do you show up here unannounced?

00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:05.525
Why do you keep coming here?

00:56:06.146 --> 00:56:09.165
I need to keep something in the basement.

00:56:09.282 --> 00:56:12.065
What's up with all this
shenanigan every night?

00:56:12.185 --> 00:56:14.605
You're just like your dad.

00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:20.845
Is that...

00:56:22.596 --> 00:56:24.085
Min Gu?

00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.845
Yes.

00:56:26.199 --> 00:56:27.915
You crazy little punk.

00:56:38.445 --> 00:56:39.925
Be quiet.

00:56:51.525 --> 00:56:54.175
- Please... - Min Gu.

00:56:54.694 --> 00:56:56.145
Stop now.

00:56:56.563 --> 00:56:58.390
We used to play together.

00:56:58.398 --> 00:57:00.330
He gave me game consoles and yoghurt.

00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:03.385
He'd play videos for me too.

00:57:04.104 --> 00:57:06.325
Your brother.

00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:14.195
I'm looking for my brother too.

00:57:15.649 --> 00:57:17.165
He is...

00:57:20.587 --> 00:57:22.075
also possessed.

00:57:22.622 --> 00:57:24.105
He's possessed by a spirit.

00:57:25.492 --> 00:57:27.420
He used to be kind and quiet,
but he suddenly changed.

00:57:27.427 --> 00:57:28.915
Your brother did too, right?

00:57:31.398 --> 00:57:33.115
You want to go back, don't you?

00:57:34.568 --> 00:57:36.555
You want your brother back.

00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:38.955
I'll help you.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:44.965
Your brother.

00:57:46.513 --> 00:57:47.935
Where is he?

00:58:25.051 --> 00:58:27.575
- Who is it? - Open the door!

00:58:29.189 --> 00:58:30.705
I'm busy, Mom.

00:58:31.291 --> 00:58:32.745
Later.

00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:36.375
Open the door!

00:58:42.636 --> 00:58:44.185
Get lost!

00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:47.255
I killed women because of you!

00:59:02.489 --> 00:59:03.975
No!

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:58.825
It's over.

00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.295
You're...

01:00:02.315 --> 01:00:06.765
under arrest for kidnap and murder...

01:00:41.588 --> 01:00:43.175
What are you doing now?

01:00:43.523 --> 01:00:45.190
You want to take him away like last time?

01:00:45.191 --> 01:00:46.645
Gosh.

01:00:48.094 --> 01:00:49.660
Just give me some time to exorcize him.

01:00:49.663 --> 01:00:50.960
I need to get some information from him.

01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:52.860
Are you serious?

01:00:52.866 --> 01:00:54.555
If you take him now,

01:00:55.035 --> 01:00:58.055
he'll try to kill himself like
the previous one. You know that.

01:01:00.774 --> 01:01:02.955
Please trust me.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.165
Two hours.

01:01:09.582 --> 01:01:12.305
- After that, I'm taking him. - Okay.

01:01:19.359 --> 01:01:20.815
Hold on.

01:01:21.127 --> 01:01:22.915
What is he doing?

01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:25.615
- Hey. - Hey.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.399
- Hey. - Why can't I open it?

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.885
Gosh.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:32.325
- Stop it! - Stop right now!

01:01:32.706 --> 01:01:34.125
Stop!

01:01:34.174 --> 01:01:36.025
Stop right now!

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.325
Open the door!

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.465
That little punk...

01:01:59.399 --> 01:02:02.655
- Stop. - Stop right now.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:06.430
What are you doing?

01:02:06.439 --> 01:02:07.895
- Hey! - Hey!

01:02:12.612 --> 01:02:14.065
Hold on.

01:02:14.247 --> 01:02:17.265
Park Il Do!

01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:24.375
Gosh.

01:02:53.686 --> 01:02:55.775
I don't feel like myself.

01:02:55.922 --> 01:02:57.445
I get texts...

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:59.145
from Park Il Do.

01:02:59.392 --> 01:03:02.715
Are you still chasing that spirit?

01:03:02.762 --> 01:03:05.385
I want to hear about the day when
my brother became possessed.

01:03:05.665 --> 01:03:08.660
That crazy monster who killed the
police officer and the family.

01:03:08.668 --> 01:03:10.215
Is he your brother?

01:03:10.236 --> 01:03:11.770
Priest Choi is not the culprit.

01:03:11.771 --> 01:03:14.295
Park Il Do who moved from me to him did it.

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:16.240
The female police officer
who died that day...

01:03:16.242 --> 01:03:17.695
is my mom.

01:03:17.844 --> 01:03:19.510
You can blame me if you want.

01:03:19.512 --> 01:03:21.135
It's my fault.
