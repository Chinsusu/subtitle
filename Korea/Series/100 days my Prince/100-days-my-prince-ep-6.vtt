WEBVTT

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:30.165
That body is not that of the Crown Prince.

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:34.105
If the Crown Prince is
alive, kill him for certain.

00:00:34.718 --> 00:00:40.005
You must bring me his head.

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:02.895
That must have been the Crown Prince.

00:01:08.218 --> 00:01:10.475
Where did the guard roll down?

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.215
Not even the palace guards
were able to track him down.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.755
We should head into the village then.

00:01:27.437 --> 00:01:29.100
What is the problem?

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:30.695
He is coming this way.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.340
That is Ma Chil. He looks nice,

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:35.940
but he is so cruel.

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:39.265
He often beats up people
regardless of gender.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.080
You must be careful about him too.

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:47.015
If you run into him, make
sure you run away, okay?

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:57.325
I am feeling very uncomfortable.

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.800
It... It is because it is cramped.
Hang on a little.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.865
It is not because of that.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.705
Then why?

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:13.975
What is making you uncomfortable?

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:18.405
I think my memory has returned.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.475
What does his memory being
restored mean for me?

00:02:23.827 --> 00:02:25.915
Will he find out...

00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:28.915
that I have been lying to him?

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:53.875
You said my body would remember
even if my head does not.

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.345
I think my body remembers you.

00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:03.485
Stay here for a second.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.555
Why? Where are you going?

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.775
Is it good?

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.275
Why would you take that from a young child?

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.345
My goodness, that punk!

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.900
I can pay.

00:03:43.907 --> 00:03:47.195
You should pay today. I am not
letting you run a tab today.

00:03:47.344 --> 00:03:49.695
I have money for this.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.765
Do you have a vacancy?

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.075
One just became available. This way.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.750
If someone came across the corpse,

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:01.320
he would be under the name John Doe.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.159
Ask the morgue worker at
the magistrate's office.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.785
We must find the body and
bring it to Vice-Premier.

00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:10.925
Even if he survived the fall,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:13.630
he would not have been able to move.

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:17.165
Meet physicians and ask
them about recent patients.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.765
- Yes, master. - Yes, master.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.035
There are 22 villages near Mount Chunwoo.

00:04:25.815 --> 00:04:27.735
We must hurry.

00:04:31.821 --> 00:04:34.215
Won Deuk, there you are.

00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:37.559
I was impressed by your words
at the magistrate's office.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.360
Instead of being painted a fool,

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.390
you would take on the responsibility
of paying back your debt.

00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.625
You threatened to sell Hong Shim off.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.370
It must be a nightmare
to think of your debt.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.765
I know what you are going through.

00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.800
This is between you and me,

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.240
but Hong Shim is worth at least 50 yang.

00:04:55.245 --> 00:04:58.480
Pay off your debt with it
and we will share the rest.

00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:00.035
What do you say?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.110
You are annoying me.

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.550
Loan sharks are supposed to be annoying.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.575
You are supposed to be uncomfortable.

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:09.515
Still, since you are quite likable,

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.560
I will do you a favor and
sell her off as a concubine,

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.255
not a slave.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:19.555
What is up with your cold eyes?

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:21.955
I am going to be a bit upset too.

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:24.095
Drop your eyes.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:28.140
I heard you lost your memory.

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.765
I guess you lost your fear along with it.

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:33.435
Drop your darn eyes.

00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:38.020
Look at you.

00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:39.720
You must be confident in fighting.

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:41.590
I have no memory of fighting with someone.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:43.590
I have no memory of it either...

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:46.185
because I always beat
people up unilaterally.

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:51.285
I will drop my eyes if
that is what you want.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.455
- Will this much enough?
- Are you kidding me?

00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.165
I am not kidding.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.935
Why is he not coming?

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.745
Is he getting beaten up by Ma Chil?

00:06:14.758 --> 00:06:16.615
Come look around.

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:20.485
Welcome. Take a look.

00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:42.965
Seok Ha?

00:07:45.748 --> 00:07:48.735
I am Yoon Yi Suh.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.405
I think you are mistaken.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.085
Hey.

00:08:19.782 --> 00:08:21.275
I am right.

00:08:22.619 --> 00:08:24.105
It is you.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.675
You are still horrible at swordsmanship.

00:08:41.838 --> 00:08:43.325
How...

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.565
could you do this?

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:48.765
You are alive like this,

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:50.635
so how could you...

00:08:52.382 --> 00:08:54.335
I thought you were dead.

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:58.045
I thought you would never come to see me...

00:08:58.054 --> 00:09:01.145
unless you were dead.

00:09:02.659 --> 00:09:05.415
Do not tell me you forgot.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.055
We promised to meet at Mojeong
Bridge if we parted ways.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.185
Did you forget about it?

00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:16.095
Why did you do it?

00:09:16.439 --> 00:09:18.065
Why in the world?

00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:22.570
Tell me something.

00:09:22.579 --> 00:09:24.735
Tell me your excuses.

00:09:32.855 --> 00:09:36.315
You know how much I missed you?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.785
I missed you too.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.535
Seok Ha, what is...

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:10.745
I have to go.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.890
No... No way.

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:14.630
There is something I must resolve.

00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:17.355
I will go find you once it is over.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.625
No, do not go. I will never let you go.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:25.465
We are not supposed to exist in this world.

00:10:25.908 --> 00:10:29.365
So we must not see each other either.

00:10:29.746 --> 00:10:33.235
We can live in hiding
so no one can find us.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.505
This is the last.

00:10:35.818 --> 00:10:39.675
Once I get this done, I can leave with you.

00:10:40.289 --> 00:10:42.115
Wait a little more.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.715
It will not take long.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.309
It is the house on Gomdallae Road
with a cherry tree in its yard.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.865
You have to keep your promise this time.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.115
What are you staring at?

00:11:24.634 --> 00:11:26.285
It is nothing.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.500
I told you to wait.

00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:32.095
Do not tell me you had gukbap alone.

00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:37.095
Did you cry?

00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:44.105
The gukbap place is not that way.

00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:48.050
It is just a bowl of it, not two.

00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:50.045
Are you not going to buy me even that?

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.785
That would be so cheap of you.

00:11:55.898 --> 00:11:57.455
Go eat it alone.

00:11:58.735 --> 00:12:00.685
Are you giving me all this money?

00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:05.595
Then I will have gukbap
and meat pancakes too.

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:11.005
- I will have yellow corvina too.
- Suit yourself.

00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:16.035
It is uncomfortable to eat alone.

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:18.775
You said you would share a bowl with me.

00:12:19.188 --> 00:12:21.745
Your Highness...

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:23.415
Your Highness...

00:12:23.693 --> 00:12:26.615
Your Highness...

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:31.725
Who is it? Come here.

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:37.300
How are you alive?

00:12:37.306 --> 00:12:38.940
I thought you went to the rain
ritual with the Crown Prince.

00:12:38.941 --> 00:12:41.270
I got rashes all over my
body, so he left without me,

00:12:41.277 --> 00:12:43.595
saying it was unclean and uncomfortable.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.810
There is no way the Crown
Prince has passed away.

00:12:45.815 --> 00:12:48.605
It is not true, is it?
It is a dream, right?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.405
I am still in my dream, am I not?

00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:01.685
It is not a dream, right?

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.855
Your Highness...

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:11.795
Your Highness.

00:13:12.175 --> 00:13:13.865
What is written here?

00:13:14.944 --> 00:13:16.635
You know what it is about?

00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:20.435
What is the meaning of that Chinese letter?

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.050
It indicates the death of the Crown Prince.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.050
What?

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.980
How did he end up dying
at such a young age?

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:28.975
He must have been darned.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.920
His father killed so many people...

00:13:30.927 --> 00:13:33.285
just to become a king.

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:38.025
Oh, no.

00:13:38.768 --> 00:13:40.525
- Gosh. - How poor.

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:42.355
- The Crown Prince... - What happened?

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:45.225
Hong Shim, what should we do?

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:47.595
The Crown Prince passed away.

00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:49.235
What?

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:53.580
Who died?

00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.910
The Crown Prince. He is such a jerk.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.680
He was going to pass away this early,

00:13:58.688 --> 00:14:00.905
then why did he order us to get married?

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:10.215
Is the news of his death that shocking?

00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:39.085
We have ruined the body so that
others cannot recognize its shape,

00:14:39.595 --> 00:14:42.155
but are you sure we will not get caught?

00:14:42.198 --> 00:14:45.055
What if someone recognizes it is not him?

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.125
We just need to pass through
the shrouding process.

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:55.135
No one will get to see the sight
of the Crown Prince ever again...

00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:57.535
because he will be stuck...

00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:00.605
in a casket forever.

00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:07.245
Eunuch Yang, please check
through His Highness' body.

00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:18.525
How is he still alive?

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.360
Your Highness.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:51.255
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:54.100
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:56.695
Your Highness.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:12.080
I feel so sorry for the Crown Prince.

00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:14.750
Is it not enough that you suffered under...

00:16:14.757 --> 00:16:16.650
the nasty punk for 10 years?

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:18.590
Get over it now.

00:16:18.594 --> 00:16:20.360
Do not say that!

00:16:20.363 --> 00:16:22.785
He complained every day,

00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:24.760
but he was very thoughtful.

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:27.055
He lost his mother the day
his father became king...

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.370
and yearned for a girl.

00:16:29.372 --> 00:16:32.525
He hurt inside and that made
him have a bit nasty temper.

00:16:39.815 --> 00:16:41.235
Your Highness.

00:16:42.018 --> 00:16:44.605
If you were to die so early,

00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.515
why did you read so much?

00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:53.615
Your Highness.

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:21.245
You must look decent for the rain ritual.

00:17:22.224 --> 00:17:26.245
Are you saying I do not look decent now?

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:33.960
I apologize. Are you okay?

00:17:33.969 --> 00:17:35.525
Would I be?

00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:38.565
Your face makes me uncomfortable.

00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:42.565
Fingernails.

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:44.379
What? Fingernails?

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.080
Yes, his fingernails. Something is off.

00:17:47.083 --> 00:17:48.975
I am sure that I...

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:54.950
Arrest him this instant.

00:17:54.957 --> 00:17:56.515
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

00:18:00.763 --> 00:18:04.755
What is this about? Why are you doing this?

00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:26.975
You kept going out to work for money.

00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:30.115
Just look at you now.

00:18:30.493 --> 00:18:32.585
Sit up.

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:41.425
Chew on this to get the fever down.

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:44.155
Go on.

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:47.095
What is wrong with you?

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:52.005
Did Won Deuk get into trouble
again at the marketplace?

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:54.505
I should just...

00:18:57.319 --> 00:19:01.005
I met my brother.

00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:06.985
In the marketplace. I saw my brother.

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.225
Is that not a good thing?

00:19:12.468 --> 00:19:14.655
Why are you sick in bed?

00:19:15.304 --> 00:19:19.340
He left. We did not have time to talk.

00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:21.570
What punk would do that?

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.640
You missed him for over 10 years.

00:19:23.646 --> 00:19:25.765
Did he disappear again?

00:19:26.048 --> 00:19:28.080
He must sort something out.

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:31.775
He said he will come for
me when that is over.

00:19:34.256 --> 00:19:38.115
If that is the case, can you not go...

00:19:38.194 --> 00:19:40.715
and stay with me instead?

00:19:40.829 --> 00:19:43.190
What if we are found out?

00:19:43.199 --> 00:19:45.400
No, you will fall into danger too.

00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:47.995
What about Won Deuk then?

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:52.765
It was a sham marriage just to
obey the Crown Prince's order.

00:19:53.042 --> 00:19:56.165
And he is dead anyway.

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.605
What are they talking about?

00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:17.185
Say something. Make an excuse at least.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.325
Who was...

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.795
that man?

00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:42.445
What is it? Is Hong Shim
giving you a hard time?

00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:44.920
Did she kick you out? Throw you out?

00:20:44.927 --> 00:20:46.660
I have a question.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:48.385
A question?

00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:51.399
It must be something very urgent.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.285
Why would you be here in
the middle of the night...

00:20:56.572 --> 00:20:59.470
You could have a question.
You could be curious.

00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:03.210
Can you not get your body
to do what you want?

00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:08.149
Go into detail. Which
part is worrying you how?

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.550
- Hong Shim. - Yes, what about her?

00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:15.050
Was she with another man while
I was serving our country?

00:21:15.057 --> 00:21:17.190
That could not be.

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:20.290
To be honest, quite a few men...

00:21:20.296 --> 00:21:23.755
showed an interest in her. But...

00:21:24.366 --> 00:21:28.525
she did not fall for any of them.
Try as they might, she did not.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.665
I have never even seen her smile at a man.

00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:36.710
My wife Kkeut Nyeo says...

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.840
she never heard that
Hong Shim dated someone.

00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:43.180
She did not even know that
you two were betrothed.

00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:45.650
You two seem to have dated for years,

00:21:45.654 --> 00:21:46.950
but we knew nothing.

00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:49.175
If you did not know about me,

00:21:49.325 --> 00:21:52.490
then you might know of
her other boyfriends.

00:21:52.494 --> 00:21:54.785
You have a point.

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:59.460
There is nothing to worry about.

00:21:59.468 --> 00:22:01.830
The men in her past have nothing over her.

00:22:01.837 --> 00:22:05.770
A man is about power and
you have it all now.

00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:10.635
Now you are Hong Shim's
husband and she is your wife.

00:22:11.447 --> 00:22:13.840
I have no idea what you are saying.

00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.950
What I am saying is,

00:22:15.951 --> 00:22:19.250
you should gain some points tonight.

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.580
So she will not get distracted.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:23.050
Look at Kkeut Nyeo. She
is never distracted.

00:22:23.058 --> 00:22:24.645
I am a man.

00:22:29.064 --> 00:22:31.455
The first thing to do is...

00:22:42.044 --> 00:22:43.440
Why are you zoning out?

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:45.865
I never go out at night
to have enough sleep.

00:22:46.949 --> 00:22:49.275
Why would I zone out?

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:57.115
What did the Crown Prince's
sealed letter say?

00:22:58.327 --> 00:23:00.085
It was a riddle.

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:02.085
A riddle?

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:07.600
You look disappointed, which means
you were unable to solve it.

00:23:07.603 --> 00:23:09.470
I could have but I did not.

00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.570
Why not? It was from the Crown Prince.

00:23:11.573 --> 00:23:14.365
Why bother solving it when he is dead?

00:23:14.476 --> 00:23:18.305
Even if I solved it, he could not
say if I were right or wrong.

00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:21.835
Even if I were right, he
could not promote me.

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:24.280
Where is the Je Yoon I know?

00:23:24.286 --> 00:23:28.245
The Je Yoon who does things that
others say you should not care for?

00:23:28.724 --> 00:23:30.950
There is no point in doing that.

00:23:30.959 --> 00:23:34.545
I have decided to stop
going out of my way...

00:23:34.663 --> 00:23:37.355
to do things I do not need to.

00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:41.525
Sure. It is your life and your choice.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.495
I cannot force you.

00:23:50.913 --> 00:23:52.765
What is wrong with your foot?

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.405
The new socks my mother
made for me are small.

00:23:57.553 --> 00:23:59.475
My heel is scraped.

00:24:00.823 --> 00:24:02.475
Your heel?

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:07.545
So what about it? I will not bother.

00:24:07.663 --> 00:24:10.055
- Go. - Weirdo.

00:24:19.842 --> 00:24:23.065
Who knows the Crown Prince the best?

00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:25.379
You gave up on the riddle.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.405
I realized that there is
no reason to give up.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:30.805
Eunuch Yang, right?

00:24:31.854 --> 00:24:33.575
Is he alive?

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.415
I cannot guarantee he is.

00:24:40.329 --> 00:24:43.355
Why can you not guarantee that?

00:25:03.652 --> 00:25:05.750
It is said your wish will come true...

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:07.745
if the lantern reaches the sea safely,

00:25:07.856 --> 00:25:10.045
so I floated it on the water for you.

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:11.915
I prayed for you...

00:25:12.027 --> 00:25:14.845
to meet your brother again.

00:25:20.802 --> 00:25:24.655
Thanks to you, I was able to meet him.

00:25:33.849 --> 00:25:38.545
That expression is for when
you yearn for someone.

00:25:44.059 --> 00:25:45.585
Her movements...

00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.515
also indicate that she is
desperately waiting for someone.

00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:07.035
If you see Hong Shim,

00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:09.610
just walk towards her.

00:26:09.618 --> 00:26:11.319
Keep on walking.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.045
What is important is your gaze.

00:26:15.724 --> 00:26:18.615
"I am on fire tonight."

00:26:18.727 --> 00:26:21.960
That must be the gaze you hold.

00:26:21.964 --> 00:26:23.090
I do not want to.

00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:25.199
This is not for my sake.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.255
I am trying to help you.

00:26:29.671 --> 00:26:32.525
I see that you do not need it.

00:26:35.043 --> 00:26:36.635
Your normal gaze...

00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:39.035
will do the trick.

00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:41.935
- Your gaze... - What was I expecting?

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.180
No, wait!

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.145
It is time for the good stuff.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.845
Where were you wandering about at night?

00:26:51.627 --> 00:26:55.460
Pick a bouquet of pretty
flowers on your way.

00:26:55.464 --> 00:26:58.725
In my experience, all women love flowers.

00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:04.755
Hand it to her nonchalantly...

00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:08.125
and deliver the line to seal the deal.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.565
I picked it on my way home
since they reminded me of you.

00:27:12.948 --> 00:27:15.575
They reminded you of me?

00:27:16.418 --> 00:27:20.375
These flowers that stink of dog pee?

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:22.375
Dog...

00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:26.090
- What? - Maybe it is because of its scent,

00:27:26.094 --> 00:27:29.030
but all dogs in the village pee on them.

00:27:29.031 --> 00:27:32.185
That is why nobody touches them.

00:27:38.974 --> 00:27:41.440
Do not pick flowers from now on.

00:27:41.443 --> 00:27:42.610
Wherever they are,

00:27:42.611 --> 00:27:46.205
they are most beautiful where they grow.

00:27:47.516 --> 00:27:49.080
Head inside and go to bed.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:51.105
I am going for some fresh air.

00:27:55.457 --> 00:27:57.145
I would rather you do not.

00:28:20.248 --> 00:28:21.835
What are you doing?

00:28:22.718 --> 00:28:24.175
You...

00:28:25.854 --> 00:28:27.545
did not meet my gaze.

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:47.065
- What was that for?
- I could ask you the same thing!

00:28:47.109 --> 00:28:49.740
Your lips were only inches away.

00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:51.365
Why stop in your tracks?

00:28:51.947 --> 00:28:54.265
I did not wish to kiss her.

00:28:54.516 --> 00:28:56.375
It was to confirm a theory.

00:28:57.085 --> 00:29:00.245
I read her gaze.

00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:01.915
Goodness.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.690
I thought it was only letters,

00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:05.685
but you read gazes too?

00:29:06.962 --> 00:29:09.960
Won Deuk, please do not be like this.

00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:12.360
Get your act together.

00:29:12.367 --> 00:29:14.000
Think about what you have done so far.

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.400
All you brought her is debt.

00:29:15.403 --> 00:29:17.570
If you were in her shoes,

00:29:17.572 --> 00:29:20.595
would you find yourself a reliable husband?

00:29:21.943 --> 00:29:23.435
Goodness.

00:29:23.879 --> 00:29:25.605
Who am I to blame you though?

00:29:25.847 --> 00:29:28.535
I am the one who dragged
you here to marry her.

00:29:33.188 --> 00:29:34.520
Time is ticking.

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.775
Head inside and transcribe more books.

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:39.485
Paying off your debt will
restore your dignity.

00:29:39.928 --> 00:29:42.255
Hurry. Go on.

00:29:42.297 --> 00:29:44.185
Won Deuk, are you home?

00:29:56.678 --> 00:29:59.005
Please let me see His Majesty!

00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:02.575
I have something urgent to tell him!

00:30:02.984 --> 00:30:07.075
Please let His Majesty know.

00:30:11.259 --> 00:30:13.920
Eunuch Yang is causing a
commotion and demanding

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:15.715
an audience with you.

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:20.325
Here.

00:30:21.736 --> 00:30:25.765
You want Won Deuk to read this to you?

00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:26.870
Yes.

00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:30.510
I saw at the party that he can read.

00:30:30.512 --> 00:30:32.940
No can do. He is busy.

00:30:32.948 --> 00:30:35.905
He has no time for this, so hurry home.

00:30:36.084 --> 00:30:38.675
- Come on. - I can read them for you,

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.875
but not for free.

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:44.345
2 pun for documents and 5 pun for books.

00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:49.230
Yes, of course. It cannot be for free.

00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:52.800
We do not have any money though.

00:30:52.801 --> 00:30:54.885
We do not.

00:30:54.936 --> 00:30:57.795
Then find someone else
to read them for you.

00:30:57.939 --> 00:31:00.025
I have work to do.

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:02.095
You do not.

00:31:08.116 --> 00:31:10.705
Do not bother with your urgent business...

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.450
and read the books for them for free.

00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:16.175
You said we needed to earn money.

00:31:17.692 --> 00:31:19.490
Look at them.

00:31:19.494 --> 00:31:23.085
I wish to make up for my
mistake as soon as possible.

00:31:24.032 --> 00:31:26.255
It is for my sake...

00:31:26.835 --> 00:31:28.655
and for yours.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.770
I will not let you especially
if it is for my sake.

00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:33.540
A man should...

00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.265
not exploit the poor.

00:31:35.377 --> 00:31:36.995
Hong Shim.

00:31:37.312 --> 00:31:41.135
We desperately need the
money to pay off the debt.

00:31:41.516 --> 00:31:44.535
The late hours must have
clouded my judgement.

00:31:45.387 --> 00:31:47.475
One's knowledge is to be shared.

00:31:47.489 --> 00:31:49.615
A great man...

00:31:49.758 --> 00:31:52.359
should share the knowledge
he has with others.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.115
Is it for free then?

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:55.829
Thank you, Won Deuk.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.755
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

00:32:02.337 --> 00:32:04.670
Vice-Premier, there must
be a misunderstanding.

00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:08.309
You must find it suspicious
that I stayed behind,

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.470
but the Crown Prince ordered me not to.

00:32:10.478 --> 00:32:12.365
There are witnesses, my lord.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.365
Please believe me.

00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.250
Do you wish to live?

00:32:16.251 --> 00:32:19.205
Yes, I do. Please spare my life.

00:32:19.487 --> 00:32:23.175
Are you willing to do anything that...

00:32:23.591 --> 00:32:25.615
I order you to do?

00:32:25.827 --> 00:32:29.115
Of course. I am at your disposal.

00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:32.460
During your trial,

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:34.625
no matter what I ask,

00:32:34.836 --> 00:32:37.355
your answer will be this.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.095
The...

00:32:40.608 --> 00:32:42.095
Queen.

00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:44.370
Yes, Vice-Premier. No matter what you ask,

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:47.705
that will be my answer to every question.

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:54.580
By the way, what is it that you urgently...

00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:57.445
wished to tell His Majesty?

00:33:04.265 --> 00:33:06.355
Well...

00:33:06.935 --> 00:33:09.725
The body at the funeral parlor...

00:33:12.207 --> 00:33:15.270
I do not believe it is the Crown Prince.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:17.795
How dare you speak such nonsense!

00:33:18.613 --> 00:33:21.135
- I checked the body myself.
- His fingernails.

00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:22.680
Before he left for the rain ritual,

00:33:22.684 --> 00:33:25.405
I trimmed his nails personally.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.505
This I remember clearly.

00:33:27.689 --> 00:33:30.175
I made a mistake on his ring finger,

00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:33.685
but the corpse's was too neat.

00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:44.695
If the body is not the Crown Prince,

00:33:47.342 --> 00:33:49.195
then he might still...

00:33:49.744 --> 00:33:51.435
be alive.

00:33:52.213 --> 00:33:54.965
Yes, that is correct.

00:33:55.183 --> 00:33:56.835
Who else...

00:33:57.919 --> 00:33:59.845
have you told this?

00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:02.275
No one, my lord.

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.559
I still do not know who
attacked the Crown Prince,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.845
so I have kept quiet.

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:17.755
I am proud of you.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.395
If I had not come to see you,

00:34:22.844 --> 00:34:25.010
I would have been in big trouble.

00:34:25.013 --> 00:34:28.465
Does this mean you will set me free?

00:34:32.153 --> 00:34:33.645
My lord?

00:35:04.752 --> 00:35:06.475
Should I inform that you are here...

00:35:12.026 --> 00:35:13.815
Leave us alone.

00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:19.085
Why do you look so upset?

00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:22.455
Everything has been settled.

00:35:26.674 --> 00:35:28.625
On the day when I stabbed...

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.895
the heart of the late former
king, who was also my friend,

00:35:31.946 --> 00:35:33.865
I promised myself...

00:35:34.516 --> 00:35:38.580
that I would never kill
anyone with my hands.

00:35:38.586 --> 00:35:42.175
But all my determination went in vain...

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:46.015
just because of you.

00:35:46.694 --> 00:35:50.130
I lived like pigs and dogs. My life
was no different from a butcher.

00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:53.855
I realized this position, my
world, by shedding tears of blood.

00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:57.325
But I am about to lose it because of you.

00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:02.495
Who is...

00:36:03.611 --> 00:36:05.110
the baby's father?

00:36:05.113 --> 00:36:07.635
Do you think I have let him live?

00:36:08.216 --> 00:36:10.750
I have the same blood with
yours running in my body.

00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:14.405
No, you could not kill him.

00:36:14.656 --> 00:36:18.575
No man has died recently
among those I know.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.855
There is no way that you have become
pregnant with a mere peasant's son.

00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:26.025
I spilled this water,

00:36:26.801 --> 00:36:29.095
so I shall deal with it on my own.

00:36:30.238 --> 00:36:33.300
Give me some time.

00:36:33.308 --> 00:36:34.540
I will give you four days.

00:36:34.542 --> 00:36:36.210
If I do not hear any news of
the death of a nobleman...

00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:38.165
within those days,

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.565
I shall make a move myself.

00:36:41.749 --> 00:36:44.835
You do not seem so busy with your
work in Office of Trial Processes.

00:36:45.353 --> 00:36:49.015
Your job is to frame the
Queen and Prince Seowon.

00:36:49.257 --> 00:36:51.545
I will do my job,

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.915
so you should do yours.

00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:00.985
You better bring me...

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.855
evidence of that man's death.

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:06.825
I shall do it.

00:37:36.537 --> 00:37:40.040
Tell her to clear out her
residence in several days.

00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:43.295
She should not leave any single court lady.

00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:45.040
Yes, lord.

00:37:45.046 --> 00:37:49.349
So are you saying you came back
even without getting in there?

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.850
My apology.

00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:54.320
We must find it before the trial.

00:37:54.322 --> 00:37:55.850
But...

00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:59.660
the Crown Princess does not
step outside her residence.

00:37:59.661 --> 00:38:01.160
I shall call her out.

00:38:01.162 --> 00:38:04.885
I will make her empty her
residence, so find it out.

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:09.795
If you cannot get anything this
time, we will all be dead.

00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:13.325
Both me and Prince Seowon.

00:38:15.176 --> 00:38:16.865
No.

00:38:17.512 --> 00:38:18.965
Before then,

00:38:19.647 --> 00:38:22.805
you will be dead by my hands first.

00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:36.115
Did she try to curse the
Crown Princess too?

00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:39.885
- That is... - Do not inform her I am here.

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:42.925
I do not think I can face her right now.

00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:52.140
I am the bailiff of Capital District
Office. I came to see Eunuch Yang.

00:38:52.146 --> 00:38:53.865
You are too late.

00:39:13.368 --> 00:39:15.455
This is a slave contract.

00:39:15.503 --> 00:39:19.070
You signed a contract to be a slave...

00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:20.570
in exchange for what you have borrowed.

00:39:20.575 --> 00:39:24.395
If you do not repay it by tomorrow,
you will be sold as a slave.

00:39:24.479 --> 00:39:26.540
Goodness gracious.

00:39:26.547 --> 00:39:31.605
How am I supposed to
repay my debt in a day?

00:39:38.426 --> 00:39:40.085
You are lucky.

00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.755
Give this to the creditor for now.

00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:48.260
Fortunately, it does not say you
have to repay your debt all at once.

00:39:48.269 --> 00:39:51.870
So give that to them and buy some time.

00:39:51.873 --> 00:39:57.095
Gosh, thank you. Thank
you so much, Won Deuk.

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:06.750
Pack your stuff once you get home.

00:40:06.754 --> 00:40:10.050
Demand the payment for your year's labor,

00:40:10.057 --> 00:40:12.290
and move out of the house with that money.

00:40:12.293 --> 00:40:14.520
- What? - A few years ago,

00:40:14.529 --> 00:40:18.285
your son sacrificed his
life to save your owner.

00:40:18.433 --> 00:40:21.060
- Yes. - The court took highly of it...

00:40:21.068 --> 00:40:24.700
and ordered your master to free you.
That is what this document is about.

00:40:24.705 --> 00:40:25.770
Are you serious?

00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:28.395
You should have been freed a year ago,

00:40:28.709 --> 00:40:30.710
but your master fooled you.

00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:34.410
So make sure you get paid
for your labor for a year.

00:40:34.415 --> 00:40:38.405
My goodness. I am not supposed
to be a slave anymore?

00:40:40.688 --> 00:40:42.550
Thank you, Won Deuk.

00:40:42.557 --> 00:40:47.515
How dare you? I have not
permitted you to hold my hand.

00:40:48.229 --> 00:40:50.985
Who said Won Deuk was useless?

00:40:51.532 --> 00:40:54.300
He is not useless at all.

00:40:54.302 --> 00:40:57.695
He is handsome and good at reading too.

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:00.440
No one can be compared to him.

00:41:00.441 --> 00:41:01.870
Right.

00:41:01.876 --> 00:41:04.535
- She is right. - Goodness.

00:41:04.579 --> 00:41:06.510
- Thank you. - He is brilliant.

00:41:06.514 --> 00:41:08.510
He is amazing.

00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:10.805
You already held my hand,
so what can I do about it?

00:41:17.058 --> 00:41:20.445
I want you to repair this.

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:22.955
Repair this?

00:41:23.297 --> 00:41:25.925
What is this for?

00:41:28.302 --> 00:41:29.870
What are you doing?

00:41:29.871 --> 00:41:33.340
I told you to repair it,
not turn it into a wreck.

00:41:33.341 --> 00:41:35.970
No, my finger did not even touch.

00:41:35.977 --> 00:41:37.740
- Why... - Gosh, forget it.

00:41:37.745 --> 00:41:39.840
I can repair this in a second.

00:41:39.847 --> 00:41:42.310
You should go keep on bragging.

00:41:42.316 --> 00:41:43.875
Bragging?

00:41:46.053 --> 00:41:48.505
Sorry. I take it back.

00:41:49.123 --> 00:41:50.715
You are smiling.

00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:53.185
So what?

00:41:54.128 --> 00:41:55.928
You look pretty with
that smile on your face.

00:41:57.965 --> 00:41:59.960
What are you doing?

00:41:59.967 --> 00:42:01.660
What are you all doing here?

00:42:01.669 --> 00:42:04.030
Go home and grab your gear.

00:42:04.038 --> 00:42:05.995
We have to go climb Mount Chunwoo.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:07.570
- Hurry. - What?

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:10.140
We have been ordered to offer sable fur.

00:42:10.144 --> 00:42:13.040
We only have four days, so hurry up.

00:42:13.047 --> 00:42:14.140
It has been more than five years...

00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:15.549
since sables disappeared in Mount Chunwoo.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.580
How can we offer sable fur
when there is not any sable?

00:42:17.585 --> 00:42:20.075
This is not for me.

00:42:23.925 --> 00:42:25.985
Am I the only one who is
uncomfortable right now?

00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:29.129
This is so foolish.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.415
You are telling us to catch
sables when there is not any?

00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:33.530
Should you not ask them...

00:42:33.534 --> 00:42:36.595
if we could offer something else

00:42:36.737 --> 00:42:38.670
from Mount Chunwoo instead?

00:42:38.673 --> 00:42:41.770
What then? Do you think
they will permit it?

00:42:41.776 --> 00:42:44.040
The king collects salt from a
village on the other side.

00:42:44.045 --> 00:42:47.140
It is not located on a seashore,
but he still asks for salt.

00:42:47.148 --> 00:42:49.950
He does not care about his subjects at all.

00:42:49.951 --> 00:42:53.075
- He is incompetent and greedy...
- He is not such a person.

00:42:53.154 --> 00:42:54.575
He is...

00:42:55.022 --> 00:42:56.475
His Majesty is...

00:43:01.062 --> 00:43:04.085
He is what?

00:43:04.465 --> 00:43:05.760
You know the king?

00:43:05.766 --> 00:43:08.500
Others might think you
and the king are close.

00:43:08.502 --> 00:43:11.700
Why do you not tell him to come
down here and catch sables?

00:43:11.706 --> 00:43:15.170
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.935
Hurry.

00:43:17.578 --> 00:43:20.035
I am dying here too. Hurry.

00:43:25.486 --> 00:43:27.605
What should I take?

00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.420
Stay here. You will not be of help anyway.

00:43:30.424 --> 00:43:32.690
What do you mean? You
saw what I did earlier.

00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:36.055
People lined up to get some of my help.

00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:38.555
There is something you should do at home.

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:42.030
If someone comes to see me while I am away,

00:43:42.036 --> 00:43:45.755
tell him that I will be back soon
and make sure he stays here.

00:43:45.806 --> 00:43:49.065
Is it a man?

00:43:51.912 --> 00:43:53.405
Yes.

00:43:53.547 --> 00:43:56.235
Tell me what he looks like.

00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:59.645
Whether he is ugly or handsome.

00:43:59.654 --> 00:44:01.520
His age too.

00:44:01.522 --> 00:44:03.050
You do not need to know
those kinds of stuff.

00:44:03.057 --> 00:44:07.985
Just tell him to wait because
I will be back soon.

00:44:08.162 --> 00:44:12.055
Do not wander around outside
and stay home, okay?

00:44:34.055 --> 00:44:37.550
Come tomorrow if you are not
here for an urgent matter.

00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:41.120
I have lost my acupuncture
needles, so I cannot treat you.

00:44:41.128 --> 00:44:42.960
I am here to check something.

00:44:42.963 --> 00:44:46.599
Have you treated someone
shot by an arrow in a month?

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.700
Is it because I am getting old?
I cannot remember.

00:44:50.705 --> 00:44:54.300
Even if I do, I cannot tell you.

00:44:54.308 --> 00:44:56.265
Goodbye.

00:45:06.487 --> 00:45:08.780
Do you still not remember?

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:12.245
What did you say you wished to know?

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:22.755
She did not feel lust even for her husband,

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.595
but she felt for her family's slave?

00:45:27.041 --> 00:45:29.195
Who is the man that will come to see her?

00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:31.595
What is their relationship...

00:45:33.114 --> 00:45:35.435
that she would ask me,

00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:37.905
her husband, to stop him?

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.245
Is that him at last?

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.120
- You are... - Meok Goo.

00:45:48.129 --> 00:45:49.855
It could not be you.

00:45:50.064 --> 00:45:52.285
The man was very tall.

00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:57.470
All the normal men went to the mountain.

00:45:57.471 --> 00:45:59.900
You must be really slow
if they left you behind.

00:45:59.907 --> 00:46:03.195
How dare you? You are much younger than me.

00:46:08.249 --> 00:46:09.610
Eat this.

00:46:09.617 --> 00:46:12.550
Hong Shim asked me to bring you some food.

00:46:12.553 --> 00:46:14.645
Rice wrapped in a lotus leaf?

00:46:24.732 --> 00:46:26.385
It smells good.

00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:34.195
This feels so very familiar.

00:46:45.019 --> 00:46:46.905
I will know when I taste it.

00:46:54.261 --> 00:46:57.215
Meok Goo, did Hong Shim really
ask you to do this for me?

00:47:08.275 --> 00:47:10.695
Who are you?

00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:14.410
Why are we doing this in
the middle of the night?

00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:16.735
Even the fire is acting up.

00:47:18.485 --> 00:47:20.945
Should we plead...

00:47:20.955 --> 00:47:22.775
as Won Deuk said?

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:26.145
Ask if we can offer something
else since we have no sable fur?

00:47:26.193 --> 00:47:29.260
No way. We will just get punished.

00:47:29.263 --> 00:47:30.785
Right.

00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.330
Are we all jinxed?

00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:35.725
Why is there not even a hare?

00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:41.840
Is it because of the wolves?

00:47:41.842 --> 00:47:43.465
Did they all run away?

00:47:45.813 --> 00:47:48.480
I should get back to town.

00:47:48.482 --> 00:47:50.905
I have paperwork to finish.

00:47:51.085 --> 00:47:52.605
Is it this way?

00:47:53.354 --> 00:47:56.420
Bok Eun, that stupid officer...

00:47:56.423 --> 00:48:00.585
I will go and bring him back.

00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:02.515
Do not dare.

00:48:05.065 --> 00:48:08.130
Can we not go home as well?

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:10.825
I am so scared that my heart is pounding.

00:48:11.405 --> 00:48:12.870
My goodness.

00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:14.270
If you want to go home,

00:48:14.275 --> 00:48:17.510
do not just sit there and get moving.

00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:20.010
We must find something at least.

00:48:20.014 --> 00:48:23.005
I cannot afford to be
up here for three days.

00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:26.250
Let us check the traps...

00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:27.875
and dig up some kudzu.

00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:29.120
Come on.

00:48:29.123 --> 00:48:32.145
- Let us do that. - Okay then.

00:49:11.632 --> 00:49:15.355
Yesterday, Master Choi's
servant ran away from home.

00:49:16.036 --> 00:49:18.870
Won Deuk has been reading for them...

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:21.340
and the whole town is in an uproar.

00:49:21.342 --> 00:49:22.940
Oh dear me.

00:49:22.943 --> 00:49:26.679
We cannot let him be.

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.380
What can we do?

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:30.480
It is true that we fooled...

00:49:30.484 --> 00:49:31.850
the illiterate peasants.

00:49:31.852 --> 00:49:34.750
What is so bad about
deceiving the lowly folk?

00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:36.615
That is true.

00:49:37.524 --> 00:49:39.145
But...

00:49:40.494 --> 00:49:42.585
- Magistrate. - What is it?

00:49:42.596 --> 00:49:44.760
Do you have the sable fur?

00:49:44.765 --> 00:49:48.130
It looks like we have but we have not,

00:49:48.135 --> 00:49:50.125
which is hard to tell...

00:49:54.475 --> 00:49:55.895
Here you go.

00:49:59.613 --> 00:50:02.180
30 coats of sable for our town's tributary.

00:50:02.182 --> 00:50:05.805
Does this look like sable fur to you?

00:50:06.453 --> 00:50:08.050
It looks like wild ginseng.

00:50:08.055 --> 00:50:11.045
You can trade wild ginseng
with sable fur in Hanyang.

00:50:11.191 --> 00:50:14.160
If you bargain well, you can get 32 coats.

00:50:14.161 --> 00:50:16.415
Please get a good deal.

00:50:18.365 --> 00:50:19.930
I told you to bring sable fur.

00:50:19.933 --> 00:50:22.000
Did I ask for wild ginseng?

00:50:22.002 --> 00:50:25.400
Sable disappeared from Mount
Chunwoo over five years ago.

00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:27.670
You must be aware of that.

00:50:27.674 --> 00:50:29.840
Taking herbs all the way
to Hanyang to trade it...

00:50:29.843 --> 00:50:32.710
with sable fur that we
cannot get ourselves here...

00:50:32.713 --> 00:50:34.710
is just irrational.

00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:37.180
Please write a petition to the government.

00:50:37.184 --> 00:50:38.980
Shut your mouth!

00:50:38.986 --> 00:50:40.650
Calm down.

00:50:40.654 --> 00:50:43.045
Stop.

00:50:44.425 --> 00:50:47.590
You served in court yourself, master Park.

00:50:47.594 --> 00:50:49.515
I beg of you.

00:50:49.663 --> 00:50:52.660
We will provide everything we can and must.

00:50:52.666 --> 00:50:55.930
If it were something we can
find in Mount Chunwoo,

00:50:55.936 --> 00:50:58.225
it would lessen our burden.

00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:00.065
Please try to understand.

00:51:01.842 --> 00:51:05.535
Very well. I will think about it.

00:51:06.413 --> 00:51:07.905
Thank you.

00:51:14.221 --> 00:51:15.945
You will think about it?

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.145
We need sable fur.

00:51:20.594 --> 00:51:23.860
It could become a problem
if word were to get out.

00:51:23.864 --> 00:51:26.399
We should deal with this quietly.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.030
What will you do?

00:51:28.035 --> 00:51:30.970
It is not rare for lowly peasants...

00:51:30.971 --> 00:51:33.465
to suffer untimely deaths.

00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:48.575
Won Deuk.

00:51:59.833 --> 00:52:02.100
Where did you go? I told
you to stay at home.

00:52:02.102 --> 00:52:05.325
I thought the backyard was home too.
Is it not?

00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:10.309
Did anyone come by while I was out?

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.010
Yes. Someone young, handsome...

00:52:14.014 --> 00:52:16.005
and very tall.

00:52:16.683 --> 00:52:19.075
- Where is he? - He left.

00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:21.075
Without a word.

00:52:21.321 --> 00:52:22.745
So what?

00:52:23.323 --> 00:52:25.790
You let him go? You did not stop him?

00:52:25.792 --> 00:52:27.815
He disappeared with a blink of an eye.

00:52:30.964 --> 00:52:35.255
Three very tall men did
come by a few days ago.

00:52:36.103 --> 00:52:37.970
I did not see them since.

00:52:37.971 --> 00:52:40.065
Did they say where they were headed?

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.965
I do not know.

00:52:42.476 --> 00:52:44.865
I think they mentioned Mount Chunwoo.

00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:58.615
Why you...

00:53:01.895 --> 00:53:04.185
Sorry. I am in a hurry.

00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:08.200
We should make it clear.
I did not do anything.

00:53:08.202 --> 00:53:10.025
You bumped into me.

00:53:11.305 --> 00:53:13.770
Go on, hurry on your way.

00:53:13.774 --> 00:53:15.170
You are in a rush.

00:53:15.175 --> 00:53:17.665
Why are you acting so out of character?

00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:20.935
Because of Won Deuk.

00:53:21.014 --> 00:53:22.505
Won Deuk?

00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.850
- You should be severely punished. - What?

00:53:27.854 --> 00:53:30.020
You got my hand print on a blank paper...

00:53:30.023 --> 00:53:31.720
and forged the contract.

00:53:31.725 --> 00:53:34.015
Loan-sharking is forbidden.

00:53:34.161 --> 00:53:35.960
A 50-percent interest rate...

00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.730
on top of fraud?

00:53:37.731 --> 00:53:39.360
According to the Ming Criminal Code,

00:53:39.366 --> 00:53:41.755
you should be beaten 80 times.

00:53:41.835 --> 00:53:43.269
What are you talking about?

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.625
I could report you to the magistrate,

00:53:45.706 --> 00:53:47.495
but I will not.

00:53:47.774 --> 00:53:49.365
I have a condition.

00:53:49.543 --> 00:53:52.735
Never say again that you
will sell Hong Shim.

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.305
Also, you must not to
threaten or blackmail her.

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.275
If you do not accept those conditions,

00:53:59.853 --> 00:54:01.875
I will not pay you back.

00:54:03.724 --> 00:54:05.790
Are you threatening me?

00:54:05.792 --> 00:54:08.415
No, I am asking for a favor.

00:54:09.263 --> 00:54:10.885
From one man to another.

00:54:10.964 --> 00:54:12.685
"A favor"?

00:54:13.934 --> 00:54:15.955
"From one man to another"?

00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:22.170
Won Deuk said that to you?

00:54:22.175 --> 00:54:25.210
The dumb troublemaker turned
out to be a devoting husband.

00:54:25.212 --> 00:54:28.505
He is truly worried about your safety.

00:54:28.915 --> 00:54:30.505
Anyway, see you.

00:55:12.592 --> 00:55:14.515
Are you drunk?

00:55:18.932 --> 00:55:20.525
Yes.

00:55:21.835 --> 00:55:24.600
I drank a whole jar.

00:55:24.604 --> 00:55:26.095
A whole jar?

00:55:27.174 --> 00:55:30.835
Alcohol must be prohibited
since the Crown Prince died.

00:55:31.111 --> 00:55:33.010
What if you get arrested for drinking?

00:55:33.013 --> 00:55:35.280
That is why I drank in the first place.

00:55:35.282 --> 00:55:38.605
The alcohol would have gone to waste.

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:50.760
This is all because of you.

00:55:50.764 --> 00:55:52.430
I asked you...

00:55:52.432 --> 00:55:54.730
to make whoever comes by stay.

00:55:54.735 --> 00:55:57.625
- Still you... - How brazen of you.

00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.839
- What? - The man you are waiting for...

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.370
did not show up.

00:56:01.375 --> 00:56:05.735
Only a beggar came by the house
to ask me to read a book.

00:56:08.615 --> 00:56:11.880
Are you insane? Why did you lie to me?

00:56:11.885 --> 00:56:14.575
- Why did you...
- It was to confirm a theory.

00:56:14.855 --> 00:56:17.520
You fell in love with another man
while I served in the military.

00:56:17.524 --> 00:56:19.690
So you must not have wanted...

00:56:19.693 --> 00:56:21.385
to marry me.

00:56:21.495 --> 00:56:25.385
However, the Crown Prince
ordered all singles to marry.

00:56:25.766 --> 00:56:28.125
I do not know why,

00:56:28.335 --> 00:56:30.600
but instead of the other man,

00:56:30.604 --> 00:56:34.395
you forced yourself into
a marriage with me.

00:56:35.075 --> 00:56:39.510
The other man returned and
stirred up your heart.

00:56:39.513 --> 00:56:43.135
That pain is what led you to drink tonight.

00:56:44.284 --> 00:56:46.205
He is my brother.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.515
10 years ago, I lost touch with him...

00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:56.085
and have not known whether
he is alive or not.

00:56:56.863 --> 00:56:58.955
We recently ran into each other.

00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.225
He said he had unfinished business...

00:57:02.502 --> 00:57:06.195
and promised to come back
when he sorts that out.

00:57:07.574 --> 00:57:09.925
That is who I have been waiting.

00:57:11.311 --> 00:57:13.435
You have no idea...

00:57:14.581 --> 00:57:18.050
how much it hurts to desperately wish...

00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:20.545
to meet someone again.

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.815
Yes,

00:57:25.892 --> 00:57:27.615
I do know.

00:57:29.563 --> 00:57:31.885
I think that I have...

00:57:32.799 --> 00:57:35.725
been waiting for someone my whole life too.

00:57:35.802 --> 00:57:37.600
Nonsense.

00:57:37.604 --> 00:57:39.895
You have no memories.

00:57:43.643 --> 00:57:45.165
Did you just laugh?

00:57:45.412 --> 00:57:48.380
How could you when I am heartbroken?

00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:49.780
This is all good.

00:57:49.783 --> 00:57:52.775
You now know that your brother is alive,

00:57:53.019 --> 00:57:57.445
and I know that you are not waiting...

00:57:57.524 --> 00:57:59.245
for the man you love.

00:58:05.365 --> 00:58:07.655
I shall permit you to hold my hand.

00:58:08.602 --> 00:58:12.025
You seem like you need the support.

00:58:20.213 --> 00:58:24.305
I said you can take it.
I gave you permission!

00:59:25.946 --> 00:59:28.480
Why are you alone? Where
is the Crown Princess?

00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:30.610
She secretly left the palace...

00:59:30.617 --> 00:59:33.535
to see her father at his residence.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.605
Good.

00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:40.745
So Ri, go to her chamber and
search for the talisman.

00:59:40.794 --> 00:59:43.460
You must retrieve it. Do you understand?

00:59:43.463 --> 00:59:44.955
Yes, Your Highness.

00:59:49.202 --> 00:59:54.495
I wonder why the Crown Princess
left the palace at such a time?

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:58.655
The Crown Prince always
used to stop at this point.

01:00:59.472 --> 01:01:02.265
It is where his steps grew heavy.

01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:05.910
Eunuch Yang would know more about it.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:10.705
Is there a reason why he would stop here?

01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:13.845
There used to be a cherry tree.

01:01:14.054 --> 01:01:18.545
He planted it himself on the
day he became Crown Prince.

01:01:44.017 --> 01:01:45.850
Every year, when cherry blossoms bloomed,

01:01:45.852 --> 01:01:47.645
he would stop in his tracks...

01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:50.445
and gazed at it for some time.

01:01:51.324 --> 01:01:53.775
His gaze was truly sad.

01:02:01.101 --> 01:02:04.925
Why is it not here anymore?

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:09.165
I heard that the Crown
Princess had it cut down.

01:02:56.122 --> 01:02:58.115
Bring me the keys.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.130
My gosh!

01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:12.195
- You are not supposed to be here.
- Then why are you here?

01:03:24.184 --> 01:03:25.950
Search every corner of the chamber.

01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:27.445
- Yes, lady. - Yes, lady.

01:03:39.499 --> 01:03:42.425
- I found them. - Arrest them right away.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:49.725
It feels like...

01:03:51.144 --> 01:03:53.395
I am to blame for your death.

01:03:57.951 --> 01:04:00.235
I should not have sent you there.

01:04:01.955 --> 01:04:03.375
At that time,

01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:07.445
I should not have sent you there.

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:14.260
Your Majesty.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.500
Office of Trial Processes...

01:04:15.501 --> 01:04:18.255
has arrested people who are suspected
to be behind the incident.

01:04:19.172 --> 01:04:22.165
- Who are they? - I think...

01:04:23.209 --> 01:04:25.795
they are related to the Queen.

01:04:26.479 --> 01:04:27.935
What?

01:04:45.932 --> 01:04:48.455
Can you come teach me how
to make straw ropes?

01:04:48.668 --> 01:04:51.995
This straw does not listen to me at all.

01:05:02.515 --> 01:05:04.750
You are good at using your brain,

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:06.780
but how can you be this
bad at physical labor?

01:05:06.786 --> 01:05:09.320
I just cannot twist it into
a rope, so what can I do?

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.745
Look.

01:05:12.425 --> 01:05:14.115
It will not work.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.415
This is not hard at all.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.455
Try it again.

01:05:22.535 --> 01:05:24.925
Here. Spread your palms.

01:05:27.273 --> 01:05:30.165
Spin the straw like this.

01:05:32.612 --> 01:05:35.165
Do not put too much of your strength.
Do it softly.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.935
Like this.

01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:43.875
Like this.

01:05:52.932 --> 01:05:54.030
Just do it.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.725
Then you will get the hang of it.

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.925
I did not know you had a brother.

01:06:04.978 --> 01:06:06.795
How did you happen to part ways with him?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:13.035
Literally speaking, it just happened.

01:06:15.088 --> 01:06:17.575
Where is the pouch of coins?

01:06:19.425 --> 01:06:20.845
I do not know.

01:06:21.027 --> 01:06:23.715
I must have left it somewhere in the room.

01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:30.795
Give it to me.

01:06:32.005 --> 01:06:33.595
Give it to me already.

01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:36.425
What are you doing?

01:06:51.691 --> 01:06:53.275
I bought a book.

01:06:54.027 --> 01:06:56.615
You will be surprised to see it too.

01:06:56.662 --> 01:06:59.660
Right, I am surprised.

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:02.030
How can you cause trouble every single day?

01:07:02.035 --> 01:07:03.460
Where is it? Return it right now.

01:07:03.469 --> 01:07:06.625
No. I cannot do that.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.865
Excuse me.

01:07:09.842 --> 01:07:12.610
I heard this is the Solution Agency...

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.665
where you resolve every problem.

01:07:15.214 --> 01:07:17.165
Can I make a request?

01:07:18.584 --> 01:07:20.875
Of course, you can.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.220
But our popularity is
getting higher day by day.

01:07:24.223 --> 01:07:26.945
I will pay as much as you want.

01:07:39.872 --> 01:07:41.365
Gosh.

01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:46.335
What is taking so long?

01:07:48.781 --> 01:07:50.705
Are you not done yet?

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:53.505
I am done now.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:23.405
Did you really accept it?

01:08:24.150 --> 01:08:27.005
- Yes. - You took her request...

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.520
for me to be her lover?

01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:31.145
Yes, she offered 20 yang.

01:08:31.724 --> 01:08:34.385
You sold off your husband
for the mere 20 yang?

01:08:34.827 --> 01:08:36.290
What do you mean, the mere 20 yang?

01:08:36.295 --> 01:08:38.390
I can afford a thatched
house with that much money.

01:08:38.397 --> 01:08:41.485
I cannot believe my ransom
is worth a thatched house.

01:08:47.807 --> 01:08:51.510
She might try not to pay us
if you go out of her favor.

01:08:51.511 --> 01:08:53.135
So do it hard.

01:08:54.981 --> 01:08:56.665
Do what hard?

01:09:01.854 --> 01:09:04.915
Do everything that she asks for.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.445
You mean it?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.915
Of course, I mean it.

01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:13.085
You...

01:09:15.601 --> 01:09:17.125
really want me to go?

01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:20.555
Yes.

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:23.925
Okay.

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:27.065
I will do hard in playing her lover.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.635
Gosh, what is taking you so long?

01:09:34.387 --> 01:09:37.075
Oh my goodness. Look at his face.

01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:40.575
He is all ready.

01:09:45.865 --> 01:09:48.125
My goodness.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:52.725
You look so decent, dressed up like that.

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:56.495
Let us go together now.

01:10:16.696 --> 01:10:18.985
She will not want him...

01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:23.725
to act like her lover
until night, will she?

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.925
No way. It cannot be.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.625
Gosh.

01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:32.495
Should I have not sent him?

01:10:34.413 --> 01:10:37.265
No, it is worth 20 yang.

01:10:38.951 --> 01:10:40.805
I should not be doing this.

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:42.750
I must find the book...

01:10:42.755 --> 01:10:45.075
which he bought for nothing.

01:10:46.092 --> 01:10:50.085
I wonder where he hid it.

01:10:51.564 --> 01:10:54.960
It feels like I am really with my lover.

01:10:54.967 --> 01:10:57.285
And my heart flutters.

01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:01.165
How dare you?

01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:03.525
I am a married man.

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:06.510
I already paid 20 yang,

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.735
so you should do the money's worth.

01:11:10.283 --> 01:11:12.435
Look. He is coming.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:18.845
Gosh.

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.595
He paid money...

01:11:36.242 --> 01:11:38.465
to buy this book?

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:47.975
Smash them all.

01:11:51.457 --> 01:11:53.175
- What... - Smash them.

01:11:54.093 --> 01:11:55.915
Do it.

01:11:58.097 --> 01:11:59.655
Find it now.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.655
Find it.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:06.970
Why are you doing this?

01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:08.400
What is wrong with you?

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.567
Did you not know this land
belongs to the Park family?

01:12:10.843 --> 01:12:13.243
Why would you build a house and
live in someone else's land?

01:12:13.346 --> 01:12:15.140
It was built 30 years ago.

01:12:15.147 --> 01:12:17.665
Why are you making it an
issue all of a sudden?

01:12:30.663 --> 01:12:32.985
Where is the house of the
Yeons in this village?

01:12:35.468 --> 01:12:36.925
There.

01:12:40.973 --> 01:12:43.725
Let us go. Take her.

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:46.595
Goodness.

01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:56.745
Hey.

01:12:57.757 --> 01:12:59.315
Tell Won Deuk about this, okay?

01:13:04.363 --> 01:13:06.515
You have met that man,

01:13:06.699 --> 01:13:08.385
so you wish to break up with me now?

01:13:08.501 --> 01:13:12.895
You are the one who cheated on me first.

01:13:13.005 --> 01:13:17.165
It is wrong for a man to
cheat on his betrothed.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:21.705
I will comfort your broken heart.
Forget about him.

01:13:21.814 --> 01:13:24.675
I have forgotten about him already.

01:13:25.885 --> 01:13:29.675
He will cause you as many
problems as he is handsome.

01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:32.775
I will see how long you two last.

01:13:38.964 --> 01:13:44.285
You must keep up the act. He
might turn around to look.

01:13:49.775 --> 01:13:52.695
Won Deuk.

01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:56.305
Won Deuk.

01:13:58.984 --> 01:14:01.319
We have a serious problem.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.050
Hong Shim. She was dragged off.

01:14:04.056 --> 01:14:05.120
What do you mean?

01:14:05.124 --> 01:14:09.660
You know that mountain path
at the foot of Mount Chunwoo?

01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:12.115
They want to see you there.

01:14:12.998 --> 01:14:14.455
Hurry.

01:14:19.305 --> 01:14:21.055
Watch out.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:25.295
He can ride a horse too?

01:14:25.344 --> 01:14:27.235
How?

01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:38.520
He is on horseback.

01:14:38.524 --> 01:14:40.475
He is here.

01:14:41.794 --> 01:14:45.115
It is you, Won Deuk. I almost
did not recognize you.

01:14:52.037 --> 01:14:54.200
Won Deuk, get out of here.

01:14:54.206 --> 01:14:57.165
You wench. Shut your mouth.

01:15:42.254 --> 01:15:45.145
Who on earth is Won Deuk?

01:15:47.393 --> 01:15:50.485
The Vice-Premier killed the Crown Prince?

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:53.155
Why did you press down?

01:15:53.933 --> 01:15:55.600
You are exaggerating.

01:15:55.601 --> 01:15:58.225
I do not wish to regain my memory.

01:15:58.404 --> 01:16:01.795
I want to stay with you.

01:16:02.007 --> 01:16:04.570
- Get him! - Get him!

01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:08.510
Do not go. Stay here with me.

01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:11.349
I will be here forever. Do not worry.

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:13.605
I will not leave you alone.

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:16.805
I am your husband.
