00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.347
Was he shot by an arrow?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.050
Something must have happened
during his military service.

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:40.396
He came back as a mess.

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:44.120
I dressed the wound with pine
bark and red spider lily extract,

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:45.519
and it almost healed.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.059
The wound started bleeding
again because it got infected.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.959
So? Will something bad happen to him?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.404
Let me see.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.156
His pulse feels empty,
and he is low in energy.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.936
However, I do not think
that is why he fainted.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.031
The prolonged lack of
energy and nourishments...

00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.098
caused dizziness and palpitations.

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.304
Gosh, I am utterly frustrated.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.299
Put it in simple terms and
talk faster, will you?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.199
Are you saying that it is
something serious or not?

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.169
In layman's terms,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.823
he fainted from hunger.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.963
What?

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.225
He has not been eating much for
he is an extremely picky eater.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.309
What are you talking about?

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.219
The other day, he ate a whole
bowl of gukbap at the market.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710
He should not have done that.

00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:49.790
Wounds tend to get worse
when you eat hot soup.

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:53.635
Well, then he brought that upon himself.

00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.100
I will prescribe him a
nourishing herbal remedy.

00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.021
Decoct the herbs for him
with all of your heart.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.900
It also has deer antlers, so
it will be pretty expensive.

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.675
It will be very effective though.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.040
What... Deer antlers?

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.539
Make sure he eats a proper
meal before taking the remedy.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210
When you feel weak,

00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:15.650
even ailments that were almost
gone come back in full force.

00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:17.589
Gosh, I need not be worried.

00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:21.528
He is not even human. He is a
goblin that eats up all our money.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.360
Why did you let the physician go like that?

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.759
We should listen to him and
get the remedy for Won Deuk.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.529
You see, I have not defecated in 10
days for I have not eaten anything.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.019
We cannot afford an herbal
remedy with deer antlers.

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.647
There is only one way Won
Deuk can eat deer antlers.

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:44.800
- What? - I will have to catch a deer.

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:48.879
But I have not seen a single deer
in Mount Chunwoo in my life.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.297
In other words, it is
impossible to catch one.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.450
I must do something. I should go
and try to get some meat at least.

00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:57.819
Gosh, it is not like you
can get meat for free.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.629
He already owes 30 yang. Will
you put him in more debt?

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.670
You said you want him to work.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.999
Then we should at least help him recover.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.499
If he stays bedridden like that,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.662
how will he work and pay off the debt?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.265
But still...

00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:14.700
There cannot be more debt.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.745
So you will not listen to me?

00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:21.321
Fine. He is your husband,
so do as you please.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.227
Let him die if you want.
I will stop caring.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.735
Gosh, what am I to do?

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:34.070
If the one who owes all the money
dies, who will pay off his debt?

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.264
Who will have to pay?

00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:38.124
Will I have to?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.665
The bane of my existence.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.313
Oh, boy.

00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.301
I am actually glad that he fell ill.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.307
Thanks to it, the two of them
spent the night in the same room.

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:09.982
I should make them spend time
together whether they fight or not.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.114
I must not get involved.

00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:21.278
I am going to the mountains.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.500
Did you not tell me to use separate rooms?
Why did you sleep here?

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.378
I barely saved you from dying, and
look at how you are talking to me.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:51.023
It was because I had to
nurse you all night.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.813
What happened?

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.536
Do you not remember what
happened a few days ago now?

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.098
You fell down and lost your consciousness.

00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.038
You broke the water jar
in Mount Chunwoo too.

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.370
You look nice and healthy,

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.350
but you cannot even handle
carrying a water jar.

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:12.999
Why did you break it?

00:08:13.341 --> 00:08:16.268
I climbed up the mountains and
started having a serious headache.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.879
It felt suffocating that
I could not breathe.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.526
I wonder what happened to me there.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.650
Maybe you went to get firewood and
ran into a tiger or something.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.693
I became curious on my way back...

00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:34.271
about what story I had.

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:36.811
And...

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.223
with you too.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.868
Tell me what kind of man I was.

00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:50.194
You were a good man.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.388
Yes, you were very nice.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.537
Be more specific.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.525
Well, that is...

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:03.096
Won Deuk?

00:09:04.691 --> 00:09:07.751
He was manly and reliable.

00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:10.359
He was easy-going too.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.217
Tell me something he was good
at, not his personality.

00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.457
What kind of work should I make
him do to pay off the debt?

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.300
He is good at being handsome.

00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:21.063
I see.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.962
What?

00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:28.311
That is all?

00:09:32.051 --> 00:09:34.749
You were a hardworking man in short.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.989
Whether it was rice planting,
plowing, or feeding animals,

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:41.060
you finished your job in half a
day while others took a full day.

00:09:41.061 --> 00:09:42.519
That is not the answer I wanted.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.895
I cannot picture myself with such a story.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.593
Is that right?

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.183
Then...

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.209
What should I tell you?

00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.109
My goodness.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.790
I was boiling water on the cauldron
and completely forgot about it.

00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:19.662
You do not know who you are,

00:10:19.961 --> 00:10:21.908
so how am I supposed to know?

00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:28.119
By the way, how did it end up this way?

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.181
Gosh, it is hot.

00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.844
Why are you standing there?

00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:52.458
I heard in my sleep...

00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:54.399
that your father was going on his duty.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.797
It is not the day today though.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.836
Did Gu Dol fake sickness again?

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.557
That punk has no sense of responsibility.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.007
How are you feeling?

00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:07.979
I feel much better.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.723
You must be after all I
have done to nurse you.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.619
I searched everywhere in the mountains...

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.590
to feed you with healthy food.

00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:20.618
Did you hurt your cheek because of it?

00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:29.850
I will make you breakfast,
so go wait inside.

00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.143
You might collapse again otherwise.

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.674
What is that?

00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:45.576
I am making earthworm soup.

00:11:57.961 --> 00:11:59.021
What...

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.570
Was it this soup which you
fed me last night as well?

00:12:02.571 --> 00:12:05.396
Yes, these are not common earthworms.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.964
These worms have a white
strip around their necks.

00:12:13.581 --> 00:12:14.601
Wait.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.350
Do not throw up.

00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:20.155
You do not know how
valuable earthworms are.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.025
Swallow it even if it comes up.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.629
Are you okay? Did you stop gagging?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.752
Are you out of your mind?

00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.259
How could you feed me with
such disgusting creatures?

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.899
But you enjoyed it.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.576
Because I did not know what it was made of.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.100
I was unconscious too.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.349
Do you not know the story of Monk Won Hyo?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.497
He went inside a cave and drank water.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.345
He gulped it down really well.

00:12:46.441 --> 00:12:49.571
But he found out that it was
from a skull the next morning.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.917
Do you think he vomited like you...

00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:54.213
after finding it out?

00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:57.649
No, he came to a realization.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.395
The same water tasted delicious
yesterday but disgusting today.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.755
He thought it was wrong.

00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:05.146
He realized everything
was up to your heart.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.893
We call this One Mind Enlightenment.

00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:11.006
Are you trying to teach me now?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.869
Those earthworms live only in soil,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.670
so why do you judge them
by their appearance?

00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.387
Then why do you not try eating some?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.207
I would never eat it.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.588
Honestly, the soup is not my style.

00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:25.161
How outrageous.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.456
I will not let you get away with it.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.277
I shall punish you.

00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:35.779
- What is wrong? - Because I am happy.

00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.700
I was actually worried...

00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:40.026
if your condition was serious.

00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:43.124
But seeing how you are yelling,
I think you are all better now.

00:13:44.041 --> 00:13:47.947
Don't get sick or hurt from now on.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.746
Your body is not solely yours.

00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:53.996
What do you mean?

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.645
Your body is mine until
you pay off all the debt.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.104
What is wrong with you?

00:14:04.921 --> 00:14:06.042
Let go of my hand.

00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:21.033
Gosh.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.175
- Are you a beacon man? - Yes.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.529
I am on my way to do my duty.

00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:28.687
Who are you?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.490
I am a palace guard officer from Hanyang.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.719
I see.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.565
Have you not seen a strange man
in this mountain a few days ago?

00:14:37.791 --> 00:14:39.657
I have not.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.807
I am a beacon man, so I climb up
and down the mountain many times.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.783
I have only seen animals but not humans.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.390
Hardly anyone comes around this area.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.864
By the way, whom are you looking for?

00:14:57.181 --> 00:14:59.119
- That is... - Master.

00:15:02.311 --> 00:15:03.708
You must hurry.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.270
Okay.

00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:07.723
- You are excused. - Yes, master.

00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:16.167
I do not know whom you are looking for,

00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:19.408
but you will never be
able to find that person.

00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:21.751
What is the matter?

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.800
We have found a tunic down the stream,

00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:25.401
and it is suspected to be His Highness'.

00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:37.521
Are you telling me to chop firewood?

00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:39.361
You said you wanted to regain your memory.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.955
It is all to help you remember
what kind of person you are.

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:53.537
It looks unfamiliar no matter
how much I look at it.

00:15:53.561 --> 00:15:54.753
Try doing it first.

00:15:55.031 --> 00:15:57.284
Your body might remember
even if your head does not.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.399
It is not like you cannot run
away from a crazy dog...

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.021
just because you have not run for a month.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.567
That is the way your body works.

00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:05.851
You will regain your memory as you do it.

00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:27.177
This thing called a
sickle is very dangerous.

00:17:27.731 --> 00:17:29.526
It was not my kind of work.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.169
Every man is born differently.
We must have different talents.

00:17:35.571 --> 00:17:37.712
There must be something I am good at.

00:17:37.841 --> 00:17:39.575
We must find it.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.185
Your silence makes me uncomfortable.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.747
Everything about you
makes me uncomfortable.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.721
The horrible nobleman speech
is your worst feature.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.669
Carry this and follow me.

00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:12.133
We will be able to find him soon.

00:18:13.541 --> 00:18:15.243
We should.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.489
You cause trouble for me
even in death, Crown Prince.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.312
Over here!

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:50.917
That is the Crown Prince's tunic.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.730
Do not just stand there. Check the body.

00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:00.572
I will...

00:19:02.721 --> 00:19:04.495
check myself.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.393
Show your respects.

00:20:07.991 --> 00:20:09.724
It is the Crown Prince.

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:12.026
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.459
All that dust made me thirsty.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.082
I would like a bowl of cold baesuk...

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.903
Water will do too.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.539
Why are you here?

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.389
- Pay for the water jar. - The interest?

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.889
Come on. Your business is not urgent.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.420
Pay for the water jar first.

00:20:46.991 --> 00:20:49.530
He borrowed from me 15 days ago...

00:20:49.531 --> 00:20:51.560
and smashed the jar a few days ago.

00:20:51.561 --> 00:20:53.498
You should pay me back first.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.129
The water jar belonged to
the magistrate's office.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.740
They should pay the government first.

00:20:57.741 --> 00:21:00.340
Can you not do anything
without a water jar?

00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:03.196
Ma Chil. Are you talking back to me?

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.109
I am an official, you know.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.849
You are just a loan shark
operating illegally. Watch it.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.349
How dare you look down on me when
you are just a lowly officer?

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.799
What? A lowly officer?

00:21:14.551 --> 00:21:15.672
Amazing.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.260
Hey! Do you think you are all that
because you know the magistrate?

00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:23.442
I should just beat this fool up
with my martial arts skills.

00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:25.459
What fool? I am a fool?

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.129
When were you born?

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.030
In the year of the monkey.

00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:30.230
What?

00:21:30.231 --> 00:21:33.040
One punch from me and you
will end up a cripple.

00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:34.709
You will drool forever.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.939
I should just... You fool, you...

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.179
I would love to just...

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.750
I will make sure that you end
up with two walking sticks.

00:21:42.751 --> 00:21:45.607
- You... - No. Not here. Not this.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.012
Why you...

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.459
You are just...

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.276
Stop it, both of you!

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.730
Pay for the water jar first.

00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.771
No way. My interest comes first.

00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:02.346
This is a very expensive flower.
It almost got crushed.

00:22:03.271 --> 00:22:05.892
Come with me.

00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:07.462
Where are we going?

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.139
I cannot pay the debt.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.292
Why can you not pay what you borrowed?

00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:26.065
Master. That man called Won Deuk...

00:22:26.091 --> 00:22:28.171
signed the contract.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.553
This is the document right here.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.184
That is not binding.

00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:42.675
A document he signed himself...

00:22:43.011 --> 00:22:44.740
is not binding?

00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:46.879
Do you remember Mal Nyeon
who died two years ago?

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.750
She used to stick a flower
this big in her hair.

00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:50.750
Yes.

00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:54.189
She stole a jade ring and
she was not punished.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.520
Why was that?

00:22:55.521 --> 00:22:56.948
She was totally off...

00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:01.580
That was because she was insane.

00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:04.099
Yes, that is correct.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.976
You did not charge her because
she was mentally unstable.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.038
My husband Won Deuk...

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.441
is also the same.

00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:17.800
Are you saying that Won Deuk...

00:23:18.241 --> 00:23:19.974
is totally dumb?

00:23:20.241 --> 00:23:22.280
You cannot say that now.

00:23:22.281 --> 00:23:23.720
He looks fine.

00:23:23.721 --> 00:23:25.550
You told me clearly that...

00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:28.649
he seems to be wrong in the head,
so there is no use for him...

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.324
and that you would sell me instead.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.584
What?

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.755
I am not a fool. I am perfectly fine.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.093
He says he is fine.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.888
I can prove otherwise.

00:23:44.001 --> 00:23:46.699
He did not know what went
on in the watermill,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.189
so I thought that was strange.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.250
Oh, Mount Chunwoo. When
we went to Mount Chunwoo,

00:23:54.251 --> 00:23:55.879
I told him to carry the A-frame...

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.880
and he wore it back to
front which was shocking.

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:02.316
I told him to pay for the soup
and rice that he had eaten,

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.874
and he winked at me like this.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.389
I could not believe such
an idiot could exist.

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:14.225
Some time ago he grabbed my wrist
and shoved my hand into feces.

00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:17.270
He kept running away from
me, refusing to return...

00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:20.259
the black shoes he
borrowed for the wedding.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.277
I found that very odd but...

00:24:22.971 --> 00:24:25.562
The whole village talks about him.

00:24:25.741 --> 00:24:27.516
That Won Deuk is GFN.

00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:30.708
He is good for nothing.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.720
All those stories make me think that...

00:24:39.721 --> 00:24:42.189
he is indeed not right in the head.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.230
How could a document he was...

00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:46.098
duped into signing be binding?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.042
I beg that you make a wise ruling.

00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:55.931
I am wise. Yes, you do have a good point.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.366
Master.

00:24:57.981 --> 00:24:59.204
What?

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.928
However, it is true that he borrowed money.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.720
Take back all the items he
purchased with the loan.

00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:08.812
I disapprove.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.959
He has lost his mind.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.817
- What? You cannot say that.
- He has no manners.

00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:15.290
I am a magistrate.

00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.473
I have no intention of returning anything.

00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:22.151
I cannot admit that I am a
fool who is unstable in mind,

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.721
and I do not want my debt
waived for that reason.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.840
Won Deuk.

00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:43.142
He is her husband and her problem.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.997
We must go.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:54.395
Clear out.

00:25:58.541 --> 00:26:01.263
- Are you crazy? - I wish to ask you that.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.038
Just for some money,

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.064
you turn your normal husband into a fool?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.873
You are normal?

00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:09.949
Did you not hear what the people said?

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.750
You are not normal.

00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:13.250
You told me that...

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.388
I did everything well.

00:26:15.751 --> 00:26:18.443
I am just having difficulty
due to losing my memory.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.030
Instead of covering for my mistakes...

00:26:21.031 --> 00:26:22.560
It is 30 yang.

00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:25.763
I could get that waived. Who
cares if you are dumb or dumber?

00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:28.264
Why did you not become a concubine?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.869
- What? - You must have known I was poor.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.910
Why did you agree to marry me?

00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:38.642
If you like money that much, you
should have become a concubine.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.110
What? You did not want an old husband...

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.577
and you preferred young,
physically-able me?

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.389
How dare a woman...

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.874
slap her husband?

00:27:22.751 --> 00:27:25.107
The whole village talks about him.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.789
That Won Deuk is GFN.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.880
He is good for nothing.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.420
All those stories make me think that...

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.854
he is indeed not right in the head.

00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:09.661
Why did you not keep your word?

00:28:11.001 --> 00:28:13.139
Father, you promised me
that you would find...

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.925
a wonderful man like yourself for me.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:21.046
Now that I am Yeon Hong Shim
and no longer Yoon Yi Suh,

00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:23.489
do you not consider me
your daughter anymore?

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.528
Had you been alive,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.455
I definitely would not have
married a man like Won Deuk.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.780
I am sorry to interrupt you, Your Majesty.

00:28:46.571 --> 00:28:49.011
A messenger just arrived from
Mount Chunwoo with this letter.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.028
His Majesty's face turned pale
after reading the letter.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:20.038
The letter must contain bad
news about the Crown Prince.

00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:21.632
Bad news?

00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:24.122
That is good news for us, is it not?

00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:27.024
Now, you should focus on
increasing your influence.

00:29:27.311 --> 00:29:28.371
Understood.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.981
Okay.

00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:47.452
I do not want to.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.028
Kim Cha Eon's daughter? I
absolutely do not want to.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.414
It is terrifying. It is awful.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.767
Only he...

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.681
can protect us both.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.899
Had we not met as husband and wife,

00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:23.846
we would not have ended up like this.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.679
I hope you are at a better place now.

00:30:41.221 --> 00:30:42.444
It is odd.

00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:44.749
There must be something.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.711
He fell off the cliff and passed away.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.609
One of the neighbors found him.

00:30:55.801 --> 00:30:57.780
I have no idea why he went there.

00:31:06.481 --> 00:31:08.681
There is an urgent matter I
must report to you, master.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.910
There is a more urgent matter.

00:31:10.051 --> 00:31:12.570
Someone vandalized the wall at
the chief governor's residence.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.143
Hurry there and deal with it.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.582
He is livid. We might
get fired at this rate.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.492
The arrow maker, who holds the key...

00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:21.121
to the female physician case, is dead.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.370
They must know that I am investigating it.

00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:25.129
I bet they killed him for they fear us...

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:26.590
finding out who is behind it all.

00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:28.730
You can stop digging into that case now.

00:31:28.731 --> 00:31:29.792
Wait.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.054
Because she has no family, and
such a death is insignificant?

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.270
Master, I told you that there must be...

00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:40.179
a big scheme behind this case.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.515
The culprit turned himself
in while you were gone.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.304
How long have you used this?

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.732
For about two years, master.

00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:08.631
Is that so?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.553
Then shall we see whether or
not you are truly the culprit?

00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:43.667
You are very good.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.941
How can that prove anything?

00:32:47.281 --> 00:32:48.709
It is not like he killed her intentionally.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.110
He took her life by mistake as
the arrow went the wrong way.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.880
He is not the killer.

00:32:53.081 --> 00:32:55.539
However, please lock him
up for the time being.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.985
Why must we lock him up
if he is not the killer?

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.991
- For what reason? - Because today is...

00:33:03.031 --> 00:33:04.183
the 15th of the month.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.477
What does that have to do with it? Hey.

00:33:10.031 --> 00:33:11.121
Wait, Je Yoon!

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.700
Will you not go to the chief
governor's residence?

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:31.115
It is a beautiful night.

00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:32.760
How about a drink?

00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:33.953
I think it is a great idea.

00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:36.300
- I will treat you today. - Nice.

00:33:52.511 --> 00:33:54.723
Gosh, your brother is very mean.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.217
He ought to keep the
promise he made to you.

00:34:05.061 --> 00:34:06.244
Let me see.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.584
What are you doing now?

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.043
I wanted to see your face.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.169
I suppose women fell for you
whenever you hit on them like this.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.720
No, that is not true. I have
never hit on anyone before.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.894
So I am the first one?

00:34:23.741 --> 00:34:26.291
That offends me even more.
Do I seem that easy to you?

00:34:26.511 --> 00:34:28.417
This may surprise you,

00:34:30.011 --> 00:34:32.950
- but I have a confession to make.
- Do not do it.

00:34:32.951 --> 00:34:34.511
You do not know what I want to confess.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.651
Over there.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.332
I am here to make your wish come true.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.176
It is said your wish will come true...

00:34:54.571 --> 00:34:56.091
if the lantern reaches the sea safely,

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.711
so I floated it on the water for you.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.974
I prayed for you...

00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:03.277
to meet your brother again.

00:35:15.761 --> 00:35:16.781
Gosh.

00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.461
No.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.195
No, wait.

00:35:26.801 --> 00:35:30.278
Wait here. I will go in the water and...

00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:32.504
I should take this off.

00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:37.009
Keep an eye on these for me. I will...

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.293
My goodness. I will...

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.857
This... I should...

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.552
Gosh, it is dangerous.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.491
Are you a snail or what? You
are excruciatingly slow.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.210
How dare you lie to me?

00:36:06.281 --> 00:36:08.524
You wrote down your wish, not mine!

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.479
No, that is not true. Do not misunderstand.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.612
"Please help me so that I can meet
that lady in Songjoo Village again."

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.795
Well, here. Look at the
back of the lantern.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.136
I wrote down your wish first.

00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:29.161
There was a lot of space
left, so I wrote down...

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.207
my wish as well just to use up the space.

00:36:36.911 --> 00:36:39.429
I wrote down your wish in big letters...

00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:42.462
and wrote mine in tiny letters.

00:36:54.391 --> 00:36:55.583
Why are you...

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.089
nice to me?

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.421
Since I was little,

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.887
I have never been able to
recognize people's faces.

00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:10.950
They call the condition prosopagnosia.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.909
To me, people's faces...

00:37:15.681 --> 00:37:17.965
always look blurry like
watered-down portraits.

00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:22.523
Your face was different.

00:37:23.121 --> 00:37:26.527
I could clearly see your pure eyes...

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.792
and rosy lips.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:32.728
At first, it seemed strange.
Later, it felt interesting.

00:37:35.301 --> 00:37:38.839
Come to think, it might be destiny.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.355
Let us just hurry and float
this lantern already.

00:37:47.351 --> 00:37:51.320
I am worried it might not float well
because of the shallow river...

00:37:51.321 --> 00:37:52.882
caused by the drought.

00:37:53.321 --> 00:37:57.911
Let us see. That place
should be good enough.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.331
I am okay. I am fine.

00:38:14.241 --> 00:38:16.689
That is our master's lantern.

00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:19.001
You punk.

00:38:20.451 --> 00:38:23.103
How dare you ruin our master's wish?

00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:26.180
I am sorry. If you dry it nicely,

00:38:26.181 --> 00:38:27.220
it should be okay.

00:38:27.221 --> 00:38:29.189
- Why you... - Enough.

00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:33.404
I am in a high position
unlike the way I look.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.855
Do not use violence.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.660
Is that right? But our master...

00:38:39.661 --> 00:38:42.996
told us not to discriminate
against people by status.

00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:47.927
What a respectable master you are serving.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:51.401
Gosh.

00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:52.702
Goodness.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.350
Go get him.

00:38:56.351 --> 00:38:58.595
- Stop right there. - Stop.

00:39:05.661 --> 00:39:09.536
Go with me. Go with...

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.462
Stop right there.

00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:13.100
- Hey. - Goodness.

00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:15.345
- Stop. - Get him.

00:39:22.369 --> 00:39:27.369
<font color="#0080ff"><font color="#ff8080">tvN E05 '100 Days My Prince'</c>
<font color="#ff0080">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</c>

00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:36.634
Do I have to wait another month?

00:40:07.321 --> 00:40:09.024
Thank you for the lantern.

00:40:10.821 --> 00:40:14.196
It has been such a long time...

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.600
since I last received a
touching gift from someone.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.750
Even if my wish does not come true,

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.906
I am happy enough.

00:40:24.841 --> 00:40:27.240
I have been going to that
bridge for 10 years...

00:40:27.241 --> 00:40:30.984
to meet my brother whom I parted with.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.273
I was hopeful for the first few years.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:40.330
But I suffered as the years passed by.

00:40:42.351 --> 00:40:43.819
On the 15th of every month,

00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:47.179
I was forced to admit...

00:40:47.661 --> 00:40:50.078
that he was not alive anymore.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:58.800
Please stop...

00:40:59.301 --> 00:41:02.605
going to the bridge to see me...

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.648
for I will never go there again.

00:41:20.661 --> 00:41:23.108
Hong Shim has not come
back home for a few days.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.934
Maybe she ran away from home.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.490
I would do exactly the same
if my husband was like you.

00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:33.535
I was joking.

00:41:33.841 --> 00:41:36.054
It must be because it is the 15th.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.640
She goes to Hanyang around
that time every month.

00:41:38.641 --> 00:41:40.079
- Hanyang? - Yes.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.140
She says she goes there to help out
her cousin who runs a bookstore.

00:41:43.451 --> 00:41:45.120
Anyway, she will come back today...

00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:48.078
to attend a party. Go wait
for her in your house.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.030
Won Deuk, you are here.

00:41:58.031 --> 00:41:59.632
I am on my way back from your house.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.100
What? Are you sulky?

00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:05.672
You are no friend of mine.

00:42:05.801 --> 00:42:08.085
You called me dumb in
front of other people.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:11.577
Eat this and feel better.

00:42:11.741 --> 00:42:13.950
I did it all for your sake.

00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:16.591
I thought it would be good if you
did not have to repay your debt.

00:42:17.851 --> 00:42:21.186
Is it not delicious? I got it for you.

00:42:25.321 --> 00:42:27.737
No, the rest is for Kkeut Nyeo.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.957
Where can I get that meat pancake?

00:42:41.185 --> 00:42:43.894
I am here to receive my
payment for my work.

00:42:43.895 --> 00:42:45.795
But why did you bring him with you?

00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:47.529
I am here to have meat pancakes.

00:42:47.926 --> 00:42:52.015
Goodness. You think meat
pancakes are for free?

00:42:52.065 --> 00:42:54.305
You are not good at anything.

00:42:54.306 --> 00:42:57.295
Give him some chores.

00:42:57.306 --> 00:42:58.874
He is not asking for payment.

00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:01.457
He is here for a few meat pancakes.

00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:05.354
What kind of work...

00:43:06.446 --> 00:43:10.189
should I give this GFN?

00:43:11.915 --> 00:43:14.332
How dare you?

00:43:22.495 --> 00:43:25.423
What special day is it today
that things are so hectic?

00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:30.211
Master Park is holding his
60th birthday party today.

00:43:31.306 --> 00:43:32.498
Master Park?

00:43:34.406 --> 00:43:37.944
He is the actual influence of this village.

00:43:38.446 --> 00:43:41.244
You know, the old man
who made a huge fuss...

00:43:41.245 --> 00:43:43.806
about having Hong Shim as his concubine.

00:43:45.515 --> 00:43:48.719
- Live a healthy, long life. - Goodness.

00:43:51.526 --> 00:43:53.708
Do not stare at him for too long.
He might notice you.

00:43:53.895 --> 00:43:55.525
Move quickly. You will
not be able to have...

00:43:55.526 --> 00:43:58.493
zucchini pancakes, let alone meat pancakes.

00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:18.131
- Is it good? - It is delicious.

00:44:20.585 --> 00:44:21.953
Eat a lot.

00:44:27.796 --> 00:44:29.662
Are you being punished again?

00:44:30.796 --> 00:44:33.896
So why do you keep playing
with Father's sword?

00:44:34.065 --> 00:44:37.104
You should be playing with
needles instead of his sword.

00:44:37.105 --> 00:44:38.982
I told you. I do not like
those kinds of stuff.

00:44:39.006 --> 00:44:42.923
I knew you would say that
and prepared a huge needle.

00:44:48.446 --> 00:44:49.771
Seok Ha.

00:45:27.926 --> 00:45:30.813
Even the royal court is prohibiting
people from killing cows.

00:45:30.855 --> 00:45:32.325
Who dropped this valuable pancake?

00:45:39.895 --> 00:45:41.639
I was not going to eat it.

00:45:42.136 --> 00:45:43.235
Why are you here?

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:45.754
Is that all you can say after
disappearing for days?

00:45:46.205 --> 00:45:48.244
How could you leave the
house without any word?

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.113
You know how...

00:45:52.815 --> 00:45:54.039
uncomfortable I was?

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:57.133
I am very uncomfortable
having you around here.

00:45:57.256 --> 00:45:58.511
Go home already.

00:45:59.085 --> 00:46:02.798
What is wrong with you? I
am here for business too.

00:46:04.596 --> 00:46:07.595
Do not be like this. I brought him here.

00:46:07.596 --> 00:46:10.394
Are you out of your mind? All
the stuff here is expensive.

00:46:10.395 --> 00:46:13.064
Why did you have to bring
this troublemaker?

00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:16.365
It was because he whined so much
about eating meat pancakes.

00:46:16.366 --> 00:46:18.140
- When? - My goodness.

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:24.289
You were not going to eat this?

00:46:28.015 --> 00:46:29.750
Eat this and please...

00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:32.763
go home, dear husband.

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.729
Were you really going to eat it?

00:46:38.596 --> 00:46:39.880
You eat it.

00:46:41.225 --> 00:46:43.795
This is delicious.

00:46:43.796 --> 00:46:45.122
It is.

00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:50.661
- Drink, drink. - Sure.

00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:57.632
I cannot believe you are 60 already.

00:46:58.145 --> 00:47:00.584
You would pass for a 50-year-old.

00:47:00.585 --> 00:47:02.483
That is just nonsense.

00:47:02.815 --> 00:47:04.110
He looks like he is 40.

00:47:05.986 --> 00:47:07.791
You will tell me to marry again next.

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.850
Eat this.

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:15.614
- Come on. - Hello.

00:47:16.326 --> 00:47:18.682
Everything is so delicious.

00:47:21.065 --> 00:47:24.850
I have a feeling that I
should be sitting there.

00:47:29.946 --> 00:47:33.179
I have a feeling that you will
not get any meat pancakes.

00:47:33.815 --> 00:47:37.692
That is why people call you stupid.
Get back to work.

00:47:37.756 --> 00:47:38.836
You little...

00:47:43.225 --> 00:47:44.928
What lovely writing.

00:47:49.326 --> 00:47:51.534
"Byeonhwang byeonhwang yo."

00:47:51.535 --> 00:47:53.371
"Hongsek jeokhong yo."

00:47:53.765 --> 00:47:57.203
"Namnam jeok cheongcheon, jinhoa hoa."

00:47:58.136 --> 00:48:00.012
Look at this.

00:48:00.306 --> 00:48:02.753
You are a true poet.

00:48:03.506 --> 00:48:05.615
This would make Tang poet Du Fu cry.

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.885
Master, the bird's nest soup is ready.

00:48:07.886 --> 00:48:09.069
Bring it in.

00:48:09.785 --> 00:48:12.784
I prepared a little
something to help you...

00:48:12.785 --> 00:48:14.825
age backwards a little.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:17.655
Bird's nest soup?

00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:19.629
That is so very rare.

00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:21.952
Good for you.

00:48:22.426 --> 00:48:24.129
- Oh dear. - My goodness.

00:48:24.265 --> 00:48:26.376
What a mess.

00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:31.178
Why did you spill it on such a special day?

00:48:31.506 --> 00:48:34.464
I am so sorry. I will prepare some more.

00:48:34.506 --> 00:48:36.587
Some... Some more?

00:48:37.315 --> 00:48:39.081
That is very hard to find and...

00:48:39.315 --> 00:48:40.877
I got it from a Ming merchant.

00:48:41.216 --> 00:48:44.354
The bowl that you just spilled
is worth at least 100 yang.

00:48:44.355 --> 00:48:47.079
How do you think you will be able to...

00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:49.325
prepare another bowl?

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:50.825
Forgive me, master.

00:48:51.056 --> 00:48:53.401
Roll her up and beat her.

00:48:53.866 --> 00:48:55.457
Do not just stand there.

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:57.197
Drag her outside.

00:48:58.736 --> 00:48:59.756
Oh dear.

00:49:04.006 --> 00:49:05.127
Master.

00:49:05.205 --> 00:49:08.745
You need not draw blood from someone
so lowly on such a good day.

00:49:08.906 --> 00:49:10.914
Please show some mercy.

00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:12.375
Do you even know...

00:49:12.645 --> 00:49:14.787
she upset a whole bowl of bird's nest soup?

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.405
How would she have known
it was so expensive?

00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:24.038
- She unwillingly made a mistake...
- A mistake?

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:28.218
According to your logic,
if you killed someone...

00:49:28.326 --> 00:49:30.494
and claimed it were a mistake,

00:49:30.495 --> 00:49:31.893
you would deserve forgiveness.

00:49:32.395 --> 00:49:34.704
The same logic does not
apply to both situations.

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.878
How dare you keep talking back?

00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:39.822
Drag both of them out of here!

00:49:41.475 --> 00:49:42.668
Let it go.

00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:44.641
It is my birthday.

00:49:46.245 --> 00:49:48.898
Will you come and pour me a drink?

00:49:50.616 --> 00:49:52.900
If you serve me drinks,

00:49:52.915 --> 00:49:55.404
I will consider the soup eaten.

00:49:56.256 --> 00:49:58.095
If you let me touch your wrist,

00:49:58.096 --> 00:50:01.461
I will pretend you were not so out of line.

00:50:03.366 --> 00:50:04.456
What do you say?

00:50:05.466 --> 00:50:08.005
Will you come and serve me drinks,

00:50:08.006 --> 00:50:10.831
or will you be dragged outside and beaten?

00:50:12.906 --> 00:50:14.129
What do you say?

00:50:14.645 --> 00:50:18.317
I am not fond of waiting.

00:50:18.776 --> 00:50:21.335
- Say yes. - Hong Shim.

00:50:25.685 --> 00:50:26.838
Oh dear.

00:50:27.756 --> 00:50:28.979
Too bad.

00:50:29.625 --> 00:50:31.462
You ruined a party.

00:50:31.725 --> 00:50:33.633
You must pay for it.

00:50:35.495 --> 00:50:38.963
Seeing that you think
so highly of my wrist,

00:50:39.966 --> 00:50:41.566
I do not know what to say.

00:51:01.455 --> 00:51:03.292
Do not take another step...

00:51:04.196 --> 00:51:05.318
without my permission.

00:51:09.596 --> 00:51:11.635
Highborn men like yourselves should not...

00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:13.094
taunt a married woman.

00:51:14.136 --> 00:51:16.654
I see that you seem to have no manners.

00:51:16.866 --> 00:51:18.202
Do excuse us.

00:51:19.835 --> 00:51:22.762
How dare that fool just leave like that?

00:51:24.145 --> 00:51:28.124
Are you showing some bravado
because you are a man yourself?

00:51:30.785 --> 00:51:34.426
Rumors say that you are good for nothing.

00:51:35.285 --> 00:51:38.055
I find it ridiculous that
you wish to show off...

00:51:38.056 --> 00:51:39.831
in front of a woman.

00:51:44.495 --> 00:51:46.943
You brag about a poem an
eight-year-old could write,

00:51:47.265 --> 00:51:48.735
and I am ridiculous?

00:51:48.736 --> 00:51:50.715
An eight-year-old? Why you...

00:51:51.306 --> 00:51:54.075
How dare you speak with that
tone when you are illiterate?

00:51:54.076 --> 00:51:56.555
"Byeonhwang byeonhwang yo,
hongsek jeokhong yo."

00:51:56.806 --> 00:51:59.426
"Namnam jeok cheongcheon, jinhoa hoa."

00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:02.550
"It is yellow, yellow."

00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:04.846
"It is red, red."

00:52:05.415 --> 00:52:07.118
"Blue, blue is the sky."

00:52:07.685 --> 00:52:10.379
"It is nice, so very nice."

00:52:11.096 --> 00:52:12.890
Do you call that a poem?

00:52:13.455 --> 00:52:15.741
Of course, it is, you dog.

00:52:16.225 --> 00:52:19.560
"It is yellow, it is red."

00:52:19.696 --> 00:52:21.034
"Oh, the blue sky."

00:52:21.035 --> 00:52:23.932
How lovely is that? You
write something then.

00:52:24.076 --> 00:52:25.198
Master.

00:52:25.435 --> 00:52:28.158
If your poem is worse than mine,

00:52:28.475 --> 00:52:31.708
then you and your wife
will both lose your lives.

00:52:31.745 --> 00:52:33.613
Why bother doing that?

00:52:33.915 --> 00:52:35.584
Take them both and...

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.115
"Cheukseosukyeong saseoui,"

00:52:37.116 --> 00:52:38.614
"anshinmiyak gwanchanghee".

00:52:38.915 --> 00:52:40.456
"Jisumanbok gengmusa,"

00:52:40.756 --> 00:52:42.592
"jitapcheonkyeong shinshiwi."

00:52:48.596 --> 00:52:51.084
- What did he say? - Must I translate too?

00:52:52.165 --> 00:52:53.635
The toilet rat scares easily...

00:52:53.636 --> 00:52:55.063
and the learned rat is suspicious.

00:52:55.306 --> 00:52:57.988
It steals grain from the safety
of the magistrate's storage.

00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:01.152
What they want is to satisfy
their greed and eat well,

00:53:01.346 --> 00:53:03.106
but when the earth splits
and the sky falls,

00:53:03.716 --> 00:53:05.246
they will be in danger.

00:53:05.676 --> 00:53:07.914
How dare you mock the nobles...

00:53:07.915 --> 00:53:09.853
with a poem you heard somewhere?

00:53:09.946 --> 00:53:13.904
Do you not know how serious of a
crime it is to mock a superior?

00:53:13.926 --> 00:53:16.303
You speak of morals
regarding status and birth.

00:53:17.026 --> 00:53:19.544
You told me to recite a poem, and I did.

00:53:19.855 --> 00:53:22.416
Take them both to the magistrate's office!

00:53:22.665 --> 00:53:24.532
- Immediately! - I have bad news.

00:53:25.596 --> 00:53:27.034
Terrible news, master.

00:53:27.406 --> 00:53:29.038
What is all the fuss about?

00:53:29.565 --> 00:53:30.901
The Vice-Premier...

00:53:31.136 --> 00:53:33.797
found a corpse and
returned with it in haste.

00:53:35.205 --> 00:53:36.500
It is said to be...

00:53:41.815 --> 00:53:45.182
What will we do about this?

00:53:45.285 --> 00:53:47.631
We have no time for this.

00:53:48.026 --> 00:53:50.269
Put everything away this instant!

00:53:50.495 --> 00:53:51.624
Now!

00:53:51.625 --> 00:53:52.994
Get out of here.

00:53:52.995 --> 00:53:54.250
- Go home. - Leave.

00:53:54.526 --> 00:53:55.995
Go away.

00:53:57.466 --> 00:53:58.516
Get out.

00:54:01.406 --> 00:54:02.456
Let go.

00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:06.859
What happened? Where did
you hear that poem?

00:54:06.975 --> 00:54:08.678
How did you know about morals?

00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:09.995
How...

00:54:10.745 --> 00:54:13.060
What did you do while
you served the country?

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:15.971
If I knew that, I would not have amnesia.

00:54:19.185 --> 00:54:21.500
You know what happens if
you stand up to a noble.

00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:24.555
We would have been beaten until dead.

00:54:24.556 --> 00:54:26.055
We both got out alive.

00:54:26.656 --> 00:54:29.012
- That is so but... - What was your plan?

00:54:29.625 --> 00:54:33.033
Were you going to serve the old man drinks?

00:54:33.835 --> 00:54:35.305
You came to work at the
house of the old man...

00:54:35.306 --> 00:54:36.786
who wished to make you his concubine.

00:54:38.435 --> 00:54:40.006
Why did you wear lipstick?

00:54:41.875 --> 00:54:44.089
- To impress him. - What?

00:54:46.276 --> 00:54:50.090
It was a party and we
were told to dress well.

00:54:50.145 --> 00:54:52.736
That way, I get to work and get paid.

00:54:54.185 --> 00:54:56.195
You told me to be his concubine.

00:54:56.486 --> 00:54:58.363
What? Are you jealous now?

00:54:58.426 --> 00:55:00.293
If this uncomfortable feeling is jealousy,

00:55:01.225 --> 00:55:02.491
then perhaps I am.

00:55:07.665 --> 00:55:09.849
Do not enter that man's gate again,

00:55:10.205 --> 00:55:11.735
and unless it is for me,

00:55:17.875 --> 00:55:19.446
do not wear lipstick either.

00:55:25.315 --> 00:55:27.263
I had no memory of you
which was frustrating,

00:55:27.986 --> 00:55:29.250
but I know one thing.

00:55:30.926 --> 00:55:33.649
- What? - I am not a fool.

00:55:34.625 --> 00:55:35.747
I know poems.

00:55:39.296 --> 00:55:40.458
The meat pancakes.

00:55:41.535 --> 00:55:43.136
I never got to eat one.

00:55:44.076 --> 00:55:45.331
It was all for nothing.

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.217
Your Majesty.

00:56:13.035 --> 00:56:15.146
Please kill me.

00:56:17.375 --> 00:56:19.273
That cannot be the Crown Prince.

00:56:20.645 --> 00:56:25.134
There is no way he would die like this.

00:56:28.085 --> 00:56:30.839
- I must see his face.
- You must not, Your Majesty.

00:56:31.515 --> 00:56:32.715
Step aside.

00:56:32.716 --> 00:56:34.925
I checked myself and verified
that it is him, Your Majesty.

00:56:34.926 --> 00:56:36.825
He has already started to decompose.
It is too cruel for you to see that.

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.693
I told you to step aside!

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:01.268
Your Majesty.

00:57:10.556 --> 00:57:11.678
Do you not want it?

00:57:12.725 --> 00:57:15.582
Then shall I work for Master
Park and get some meat pancakes?

00:57:16.096 --> 00:57:18.789
I refuse to eat meat pancakes if
we must obtain them that way.

00:57:30.205 --> 00:57:31.746
This tastes awful.

00:57:36.815 --> 00:57:38.244
I suppose it is healthy.

00:57:38.915 --> 00:57:40.966
They say that bitter
things are good for you.

00:57:51.096 --> 00:57:53.865
By the way, Won Deuk was...

00:57:53.866 --> 00:57:55.701
honestly so romantic earlier.

00:57:56.866 --> 00:58:00.242
"Do not take another step
without my permission."

00:58:03.145 --> 00:58:04.514
Romantic, my foot.

00:58:04.515 --> 00:58:06.755
He will get himself in big
trouble if he is not careful.

00:58:06.875 --> 00:58:08.644
Gosh, he is such a troublemaker.

00:58:08.645 --> 00:58:11.255
For me, it was very gratifying.

00:58:11.256 --> 00:58:13.825
I mean, it is unfair that
we always have to obey...

00:58:13.826 --> 00:58:15.655
and bend over backwards for those noblemen.

00:58:15.656 --> 00:58:16.746
- Yes. - You are right.

00:58:18.296 --> 00:58:22.304
By the way, I thought
Won Deuk was an idiot.

00:58:22.596 --> 00:58:24.604
But it looked like he can read.

00:58:25.265 --> 00:58:26.394
No way.

00:58:26.395 --> 00:58:29.322
He probably heard a poem or two
while serving in the military.

00:58:30.105 --> 00:58:31.360
You think so?

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:40.293
Can you read this? Try reading it aloud.

00:58:41.446 --> 00:58:44.852
Why does a gluttonous man have 50 shadows?

00:58:46.185 --> 00:58:48.981
You can read these letters?

00:58:52.225 --> 00:58:54.540
"50 Shadows of the Gluttonous Man".

00:58:57.596 --> 00:58:59.316
"The Cowherd and the Straightforward Girl".

00:58:59.895 --> 00:59:02.312
It must be a badly-written, romance novel.

00:59:13.515 --> 00:59:15.963
Who says that you are GFN?

00:59:16.015 --> 00:59:20.544
Won Deuk, you are more than useful.
You are amazing!

00:59:23.355 --> 00:59:26.792
That smile of yours is making
me very uncomfortable.

00:59:32.995 --> 00:59:35.484
Since His Majesty is utterly
devastated at the moment,

00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:38.454
I will relay his orders to you ministers.

00:59:43.306 --> 00:59:45.387
"Killing the Crown Prince..."

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:49.178
"is like assassinating me, the King."

00:59:50.015 --> 00:59:54.442
"It is clearly an
unforgivable act of treason."

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.000
"Form a special investigation
bureau immediately."

00:59:58.355 --> 01:00:01.282
"Catch everyone who is responsible
for the treacherous crime..."

01:00:01.696 --> 01:00:03.496
"and punish them to set
a deterrent example."

01:00:04.366 --> 01:00:06.068
"I would like Vice-Premier Kim Cha Eon..."

01:00:06.535 --> 01:00:09.595
"to lead the special investigation bureau."

01:00:11.406 --> 01:00:14.507
"Only allow a couple of dieners in
to prepare his body for the burial."

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:21.444
"I do not want people to see the
horrible state his body is in."

01:00:22.315 --> 01:00:25.549
"Also, minimize the burial procedures."

01:00:25.716 --> 01:00:27.868
"I am greatly concerned..."

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:31.000
"that all of this may cause public unrest."

01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:34.525
It is very strange.

01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:36.894
How could he not even let the royal
relatives in before the burial?

01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:38.976
But it works to our advantage.

01:00:39.265 --> 01:00:41.305
Minimizing the funeral procedures...

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:44.145
will help us expedite the
installation of a new crown prince.

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:49.760
What is more urgent is for us to stop...

01:00:50.076 --> 01:00:53.074
the Vice-Premier from becoming the
head of the investigation bureau.

01:00:53.815 --> 01:00:56.397
He will obviously hold us and
the Queen responsible...

01:00:56.815 --> 01:00:58.824
to get rid of us.

01:00:59.116 --> 01:01:00.818
It will not be easy.

01:01:01.556 --> 01:01:03.325
The Vice-Premier without
the Crown Prince...

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.091
is like a tiger without teeth.

01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:09.624
Even his followers will start
betraying him one by one.

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:10.891
You fool.

01:01:11.236 --> 01:01:14.397
Do you not know how menacing
and underhanded he can be?

01:01:14.806 --> 01:01:16.366
I bet he will use trickery.

01:01:16.736 --> 01:01:19.459
And we should do the same against him.

01:01:19.605 --> 01:01:21.105
Just wait and see.

01:01:21.406 --> 01:01:25.190
His Majesty will abandon
him soon and side with us.

01:01:26.076 --> 01:01:28.432
We have his only heir,

01:01:29.315 --> 01:01:31.559
Prince Seowon, you know.

01:01:43.526 --> 01:01:46.698
We did it. It is happening.

01:01:46.796 --> 01:01:48.743
You will become the king of this country.

01:01:49.466 --> 01:01:51.604
Crown Prince's Palace
will be yours very soon.

01:01:51.605 --> 01:01:54.054
Did something bad happen to Yul?

01:01:54.306 --> 01:01:58.048
- Yes. - What now? The Crown Princess...

01:01:59.076 --> 01:02:01.814
Prince Seowon, pull yourself together.

01:02:01.815 --> 01:02:04.885
There are thousands of eyes
and ears inside the palace.

01:02:04.886 --> 01:02:06.894
If anyone finds out about the way you feel,

01:02:08.256 --> 01:02:10.499
both you and I will die.

01:02:18.995 --> 01:02:20.118
You may go now.

01:02:22.236 --> 01:02:23.327
Go!

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:35.744
Why do you think that he is not the killer?

01:02:36.216 --> 01:02:38.136
He said that he has used
it for about two years,

01:02:38.486 --> 01:02:42.056
but I am certain that he held
it for the first time that day.

01:02:42.285 --> 01:02:44.539
That is not how you hold
that type of arrow.

01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:47.921
He probably did not know that
I would ask him to shoot it.

01:02:49.995 --> 01:02:52.179
And I know that he does not
frequent Mount Baegak.

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:55.036
I searched his house,

01:02:55.435 --> 01:02:57.823
and there was black soil
on all of his shoes.

01:02:58.705 --> 01:03:01.075
If somebody ordered him to turn himself in,

01:03:01.076 --> 01:03:03.626
we should torture him to find
out who put him up to it.

01:03:03.716 --> 01:03:07.459
Why must you do this? Why
let him go so easily?

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:11.204
Torturing someone is such
an inhumane thing to do.

01:03:11.815 --> 01:03:15.150
Tailing him would be a faster way
to find out who put him up to it.

01:03:15.526 --> 01:03:17.667
Then why are you still standing here?

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:05.809
What is the matter with me these days?

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:13.170
My apologies.

01:04:14.745 --> 01:04:16.888
Have you seen a man in a
black robe by any chance?

01:04:17.455 --> 01:04:19.425
He must have walked by here just now.

01:04:21.826 --> 01:04:23.009
I guess you have not.

01:04:24.196 --> 01:04:25.553
I was only speculating,

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.174
but I am now quite certain that
you cannot recognize faces.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.307
You are Ae Wol.

01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:54.541
You must recognize people by their voices.
Am I right?

01:04:58.355 --> 01:05:00.977
Oh, by the way,

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:03.441
you should be careful from now on.

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:06.689
I heard that the Crown Prince passed away.

01:05:06.796 --> 01:05:08.704
It means there will be a
bloodbath at court soon.

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:10.434
The Crown Prince passed away?

01:05:10.435 --> 01:05:11.965
You did not know about it?

01:05:12.435 --> 01:05:15.035
A notice has been put up in front
of the Capital District Office.

01:05:21.446 --> 01:05:23.166
I heard that you wanted to see me, my lord.

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:33.572
You made a mistake that
can cost you your life.

01:05:34.426 --> 01:05:37.597
That body is not that of the Crown Prince.

01:05:37.895 --> 01:05:40.334
I saw him falling after
getting hit by my arrow.

01:05:40.335 --> 01:05:41.662
It is his guard.

01:05:42.165 --> 01:05:43.941
They must have swapped their clothes.

01:05:46.105 --> 01:05:48.493
It was such a crucial
mission, and yet you failed.

01:05:49.406 --> 01:05:51.487
Do you expect me to spare your life?

01:05:54.915 --> 01:05:57.160
The hunting game is not over yet,

01:05:57.185 --> 01:05:59.358
so it is too soon for you to
kill your hound, my lord.

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.377
Just remember...

01:06:01.926 --> 01:06:04.036
the consequences of your mistake.

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.772
Go to Mount Chunwoo immediately.

01:06:08.796 --> 01:06:11.519
And find his body.

01:06:12.236 --> 01:06:15.326
If the Crown Prince is alive,

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.299
kill him for certain.

01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:19.908
You must bring me...

01:06:21.306 --> 01:06:22.938
his head.

01:06:29.523 --> 01:06:30.890
What happened?

01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:35.224
I did not see you around for a few days.
Did you leave the palace to...

01:06:35.724 --> 01:06:38.897
Yes, I moved in secret
to find His Highness.

01:06:48.144 --> 01:06:51.001
He gave this to me on the day
he left for the rain ritual.

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:53.695
Why are you giving this to me?

01:06:53.814 --> 01:06:56.054
He told me to hand this to you
on the 15th of the month.

01:06:56.615 --> 01:06:59.313
I wondered why he was telling
me to hand this to you...

01:06:59.314 --> 01:07:01.723
instead of doing it himself at that time.

01:07:01.724 --> 01:07:02.907
Now that I think about it,

01:07:04.424 --> 01:07:06.496
he must have meant to hand this to you...

01:07:07.495 --> 01:07:08.616
if he did not make it back.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:28.843
Is this not the Chinese letter...

01:07:29.684 --> 01:07:30.775
for "elbow"?

01:07:37.525 --> 01:07:39.245
Are you telling me to transcribe all these?

01:07:40.254 --> 01:07:43.018
I have brought only the bestsellers.

01:07:43.735 --> 01:07:45.937
They offered us two jeon per book.

01:07:46.064 --> 01:07:47.329
We can earn a lot of money.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:48.893
"Tale of Manly Man"?

01:07:50.104 --> 01:07:52.574
What are the odds about the manly man?

01:07:52.575 --> 01:07:54.442
It is the must-read book
among married women.

01:07:55.575 --> 01:07:58.267
"I wish to be your honey."

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.142
"Hold me tight..."

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:02.037
"before I..."

01:08:03.085 --> 01:08:04.339
"jump on you."

01:08:05.655 --> 01:08:08.275
I do not wish to read such a corny story.

01:08:09.424 --> 01:08:10.649
Do not read it then.

01:08:12.854 --> 01:08:16.772
"The two people entered a
pavilion to avoid the rain."

01:08:17.934 --> 01:08:20.657
"Yeon Hee's face was glowing
from the moonlight."

01:08:20.735 --> 01:08:22.672
"She was beautiful."

01:08:23.775 --> 01:08:26.997
"Seob grabbed her hand."

01:08:27.304 --> 01:08:28.427
"And..."

01:08:32.714 --> 01:08:33.806
And?

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.729
Just transcribe it yourself.

01:08:39.384 --> 01:08:42.791
My vision is blurry from
reading for a long time.

01:08:47.764 --> 01:08:50.213
Continue reading if you
wish to earn two jeon.

01:08:52.564 --> 01:08:53.891
Start with "And".

01:09:03.304 --> 01:09:05.864
"He untied her breast-tie."

01:09:06.615 --> 01:09:10.044
"Yeon Hee's bare skin was finally exposed."

01:09:15.924 --> 01:09:16.994
"It was so beautiful."

01:09:16.995 --> 01:09:18.923
"Seob caressed her face and kissed her."

01:09:18.924 --> 01:09:20.557
"Her soft lips..."

01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:24.256
Enough.

01:09:25.264 --> 01:09:26.967
Why? Did you not tell me to continue?

01:09:27.434 --> 01:09:28.658
It does not make sense.

01:09:29.004 --> 01:09:30.943
I mean, they just met that day.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.574
It could happen if they fell
in love at first sight.

01:09:33.575 --> 01:09:34.768
Why does it not make sense?

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:41.377
Did you fall in love with
me at first sight too?

01:09:42.615 --> 01:09:44.389
What did you like so much about me?

01:09:46.985 --> 01:09:49.095
I am already aware that
you fell for my thighs.

01:09:49.754 --> 01:09:51.050
Tell me something else.

01:09:51.695 --> 01:09:54.463
You were the one who liked me first.

01:09:54.464 --> 01:09:57.063
You were desperate to go on a date with me,

01:09:57.064 --> 01:09:59.278
so I did it as a favor.

01:09:59.764 --> 01:10:02.865
But you do not look like
someone I would try to hit on.

01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:07.238
Says who?

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:09.571
Look at me closely.

01:10:09.575 --> 01:10:13.186
If you do, you will fall helplessly for me.

01:10:14.884 --> 01:10:17.057
Is that right? Let me see.

01:10:28.064 --> 01:10:29.421
From up close, you look...

01:10:32.894 --> 01:10:34.058
It is nothing.

01:10:35.634 --> 01:10:36.787
What?

01:10:43.945 --> 01:10:46.744
You transcribed all these
books in one night?

01:10:46.745 --> 01:10:47.765
Goodness.

01:10:48.014 --> 01:10:50.911
Hong Shim, you are impressive.

01:10:51.115 --> 01:10:52.135
Hold on.

01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:54.275
Here.

01:10:56.325 --> 01:10:58.129
I am the one who is impressive, not her.

01:10:59.025 --> 01:11:00.115
I did the job.

01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:04.250
Then you must be a perfect couple.

01:11:05.665 --> 01:11:08.520
If you have jobs to do, leave
them to us from now on.

01:11:08.735 --> 01:11:10.744
We can make brand new, typo-less copies...

01:11:11.104 --> 01:11:13.798
with a great handwriting
in a short period of time.

01:11:14.245 --> 01:11:15.672
Okay.

01:11:16.344 --> 01:11:17.396
Instead,

01:11:18.075 --> 01:11:19.268
make it three jeon per copy.

01:11:23.754 --> 01:11:25.683
Now, you know how to bargain too.

01:11:25.684 --> 01:11:27.255
How dare you?

01:11:27.485 --> 01:11:29.799
I am just saying because I am proud of you.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:32.477
Are you that happy?

01:11:32.724 --> 01:11:36.397
Of course. I have never earned
this amount of money before.

01:11:37.035 --> 01:11:38.728
I am going to have a bowl of gukbap...

01:11:38.964 --> 01:11:40.244
and buy a pair of leather shoes.

01:11:40.665 --> 01:11:42.572
You cannot. We need to repay the debt.

01:11:43.235 --> 01:11:45.071
Part of that money is mine.

01:11:46.205 --> 01:11:47.632
Forget about leather shoes.

01:11:48.174 --> 01:11:50.796
We will order a bowl of
gukbap and share it.

01:11:50.875 --> 01:11:52.710
I thought you were a woman of high caliber.

01:11:53.144 --> 01:11:54.512
You are cheaper than you look.

01:11:55.585 --> 01:11:57.484
We would have been able to
have some meat pancakes...

01:11:57.485 --> 01:11:58.841
had it not been for your debt.

01:12:03.554 --> 01:12:04.778
Look at all this dust.

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:07.605
- What is this?
- We're trying our best to clean.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.494
What is wrong?

01:12:10.495 --> 01:12:11.975
The gukbap restaurant is right there.

01:12:14.665 --> 01:12:17.082
- What is the problem?
- He is coming this way.

01:12:19.804 --> 01:12:21.944
That is Ma Chil. He looks nice,

01:12:21.945 --> 01:12:23.577
but he is so cruel.

01:12:23.644 --> 01:12:26.398
He often beats up people
regardless of gender.

01:12:28.184 --> 01:12:30.044
You must be careful about him too.

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.534
If you run into him, make
sure you run away, okay?

01:12:44.394 --> 01:12:45.864
I am feeling very uncomfortable.

01:12:50.974 --> 01:12:54.004
It... It is because it is cramped.
Hang on a little.

01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:56.972
It is not because of that.

01:13:02.014 --> 01:13:03.106
Then why?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.081
What is making you uncomfortable?

01:13:07.224 --> 01:13:08.377
I think...

01:13:09.325 --> 01:13:10.446
my memory has returned.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.757
What should I do if he has
found his memory back?

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.234
Drop those eyes of yours.

01:13:56.335 --> 01:13:59.803
If that is what you want,
will this much be enough?

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.145
If someone comes looking
for me while I am away,

01:14:02.344 --> 01:14:03.701
make him stay.

01:14:04.144 --> 01:14:06.114
Is it a man?

01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:09.534
Your lips will meet hers
if you move a bit closer.

01:14:09.814 --> 01:14:11.008
You are smiling.

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.375
- So what?
- You look pretty when you smile.

01:14:17.594 --> 01:14:18.794
I picked these on my way here.

01:14:19.195 --> 01:14:20.449
They resemble you.
