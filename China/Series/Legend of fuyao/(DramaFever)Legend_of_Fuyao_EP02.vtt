00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.441
Your Highness, the king has conferred you
as the legal heir of the Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:47.045
Is this true?

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.870
What do you think?

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:57.581
Good.

00:01:57.582 --> 00:01:59.251
Sure...

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:05.715
I'll be the king.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.333
Godfather, why did you let him live?

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:19.398
You even made him
the legal heir to the throne.

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.366
He's just a fool.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:22.887
Godfather, don't tell me you really...

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:55.192
Yun Hen, have you carried out
the tasks I assigned to you?

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:59.277
All armed forces in Qing Province
are to halt until further notice.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.730
How is the king?

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:06.121
After taking the medication,
the king has remained unconscious.

00:03:06.122 --> 00:03:08.734
I'm afraid he won't
ever regain consciousness.

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:10.386
However, the royal physician said

00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:13.042
that the king can surely survive
until the legal heir takes his throne.

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:14.424
It's just that...

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:15.954
It's just that...

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:25.061
You don't understand why I stopped right
before we were about to succeed, do you?

00:03:25.062 --> 00:03:27.384
Godfather, you must've had
your reasons for doing so.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:30.883
I've carefully
planned this out for years.

00:03:30.884 --> 00:03:33.903
But there's one matter I overlooked.

00:03:34.903 --> 00:03:37.113
Even if you have me killed

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:39.812
without a legal royal heir to the throne

00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:44.375
the sovereignty will be
returned to Tianquan Kingdom!

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:47.942
What did you say?

00:03:47.943 --> 00:03:49.458
Should a royal family die out

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.960
the kingdom shall be forfeited.

00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:54.914
This is the foremost rule that all
five kingdoms must abide by.

00:03:54.915 --> 00:03:57.930
How could an outsider
like you know of it?

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:02.098
Should the royal family
of Xuanyuan be eliminated today

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:09.812
the Taiyuan Kingdom will be
no more than a state of lakes.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.042
Before we master
the skill of manipulating water

00:04:28.043 --> 00:04:31.384
we can only serve this fool
as he's legal heir to the throne.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:35.606
Have you looked into his background?

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.563
I've sent my men to investigate him.

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:40.571
It's said that Xuanyuan Min
was raised in luxury.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:42.739
Since his father,
the arch prince, passed away

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.758
he's either been out at the opera

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.597
or gambling with disreputable friends.

00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:49.905
That's how he used up
all of his huge inheritance.

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.158
He even has quite a few debts.

00:04:53.648 --> 00:05:01.648
A good-for-nothing like him is
the most suitable candidate for heir.

00:05:03.098 --> 00:05:08.739
However, he might not be as
simple as we think he is. Is he?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.075
Godfather, you still
have doubts about him?

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:13.811
All members of the royal
Xuanyuan family can manipulate water.

00:05:13.812 --> 00:05:15.535
I've already tested him.

00:05:15.536 --> 00:05:18.308
But apart from the Xuanyuan family

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.114
anyone who's trained in the force
of Qiongcang can manipulate water too.

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:28.547
At the moment, the Xuanyuan family's
bloodline is soon to be wiped out.

00:05:28.548 --> 00:05:33.721
We can only keep him as
the current heir apparent.

00:05:35.278 --> 00:05:39.183
Send your men out there
to see if Fei Yan has any news.

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:40.277
Yes.

00:05:40.278 --> 00:05:41.886
Bear this in mind.

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:45.169
Before you receive
any further information

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.825
Xuanyuan Min is not to succeed
the throne back at the capital.

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.233
Yes!

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.119
I'm punished to do laundry?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.598
This is a great chance to see
how my new machine works.

00:06:03.194 --> 00:06:04.236
<i>Fu Yao!</i>

00:06:04.237 --> 00:06:05.302
Fu Yao!

00:06:05.303 --> 00:06:06.648
Quickly!

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:07.919
Go save White, quickly!

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920
What's wrong with White?

00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:11.027
White is sick again and has been
pacing back and forth all day!

00:06:11.028 --> 00:06:13.754
If this continues... We have
to get someone to treat it!

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:15.201
I'll go to Senior Yan for help.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.729
Why would he help us with such a matter?

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.395
We should come up with another solution.

00:06:19.396 --> 00:06:21.196
If this goes on, it may not
make it through tonight!

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:22.396
Nonsense.

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:25.256
Leave this to me.

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:26.341
Stay with White.

00:06:28.002 --> 00:06:30.167
Are you going up the
mountain for that flower?

00:06:30.168 --> 00:06:31.578
- That flower...
- Lower your voice.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:33.573
That won't do!

00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:36.210
You know that flower grows
on the Forbidden Cliff.

00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:38.136
No one but the Chief
and the elders can enter.

00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:39.337
You're doomed if you get caught.

00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:42.054
Not even Senior Yan can save you.
Do you know how dangerous it is?

00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:43.164
That's enough!

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.407
I'm not going there for the first time.

00:06:45.408 --> 00:06:46.940
Don't you want White to live?

00:06:46.942 --> 00:06:48.212
Stay here.

00:06:48.213 --> 00:06:49.225
I'll be right back.

00:08:54.789 --> 00:08:56.874
Don't you know it's
first come, first served?

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:00.774
In my book,
whoever gets it first owns it.

00:09:40.683 --> 00:09:43.720
It seems that Xuanyuan Sect's
martial arts skills are quite mediocre.

00:09:55.357 --> 00:09:56.379
You...

00:10:00.773 --> 00:10:04.394
The Forbidden Cliff of Mount
Xuanyuan can gobble people up.

00:10:05.698 --> 00:10:07.533
But these are just some vines.

00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:09.534
Do you think I can't make it out of here?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.277
Give it a try then.

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.170
There are many wild beasts around here.

00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:25.549
They'll be here to feast on you soon.

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.604
Fine, I admit defeat.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.899
Young lady, I wonder what
I should do to have you save me?

00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:37.672
Wouldn't it have been great
if you'd behaved this well earlier?

00:10:37.673 --> 00:10:39.936
Hand over that flower.

00:10:39.937 --> 00:10:41.337
Then I'll save you from there.

00:10:42.355 --> 00:10:43.572
Why should I trust you?

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.211
Why should you trust me?

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:50.138
Are you in a position
to negotiate terms with me now?

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:51.351
Fine.

00:10:52.706 --> 00:10:54.171
I'll die either way.

00:10:54.172 --> 00:10:57.428
Why don't I just gobble up
the Hundred-layered Orchid now?

00:10:57.429 --> 00:10:58.429
Don't!

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:03.181
I'll rescue you.

00:11:03.182 --> 00:11:04.293
Quickly!

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:09.407
Catch it!

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:10.408
Here.

00:11:14.705 --> 00:11:16.125
Try harder!

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:24.610
Pull harder!

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:26.624
How can I pull even harder?

00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:41.815
How'd you fall into the water?

00:11:41.816 --> 00:11:43.463
I just saved you!

00:11:43.464 --> 00:11:45.200
How can you be so ungrateful?

00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:47.271
You're the one who let go of the vine.

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:48.528
What did I do?

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.070
Nothing at all.

00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:52.295
I'll get going.

00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:53.494
Hold on!

00:11:54.178 --> 00:11:55.885
Can you leave the flower behind?

00:11:55.886 --> 00:12:00.298
Young lady, you're not in any
position to negotiate with me now.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.799
You can't sell that flower
for much money anyway!

00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:05.802
I need it to save a life!

00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.159
You should save yourself first.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.305
I'm off.

00:12:14.306 --> 00:12:15.306
Hey!

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:17.150
<i>Get back here!</i>

00:12:19.692 --> 00:12:21.101
Jerk!

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:22.246
Get back here!

00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:24.813
Get back here!

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.360
Leave the flower behind, asshole!

00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:20.139
The outcome of the Warrior Hunt
will affect Xuanyuan Sect's future.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.813
Have you thought it through carefully?

00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:29.364
I'm aware of the advantages
and disadvantages.

00:13:29.365 --> 00:13:31.372
Father, you need not worry.

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:37.447
All competent pugilists and nobility
will be here for the Warrior Hunt.

00:13:37.448 --> 00:13:39.941
You're the future Chief of Xuanyuan Sect.

00:13:39.942 --> 00:13:42.338
As for personal affairs
like romantic relationships...

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:44.136
I'll let you to weigh the pros and cons.

00:13:45.198 --> 00:13:46.804
Father, you're too sensitive.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.172
Although I've always
taken great care of Fu Yao

00:13:53.384 --> 00:13:56.539
she's just a slave under
the Xuanyou Division after all.

00:13:57.938 --> 00:14:02.538
I understand the favorable and
unfavorable factors in this matter.

00:14:18.298 --> 00:14:21.609
The Armillary Cauldron is a holy relic
passed down from the ancient firmament.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.798
It only shows itself every eight years

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:26.009
when the Warrior Hunt of
the Xuanyuan Sect takes place.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:28.643
I've long heard of the many
hidden talented individuals here.

00:14:28.644 --> 00:14:30.783
The Warrior Hunt is extremely thrilling.

00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:33.201
I happen to be here this time.

00:14:34.212 --> 00:14:36.812
Elder Statesman, why don't you
stay a few days longer?

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:41.590
By then, all the renown pugilists
and nobility of the Taiyuan Kingdom

00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:43.009
will be here as spectators.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:46.759
Since I'm just in time for the event,
how could I possibly miss it?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.093
I'll stay a few days longer then.

00:14:48.094 --> 00:14:50.586
I believe that the heir apparent
is also interested in it.

00:14:50.587 --> 00:14:54.393
He can also see the heroes
of Mount Xuanyuan for himself.

00:14:57.849 --> 00:15:00.280
Godfather, are we really
going to wait around?

00:15:02.984 --> 00:15:04.682
There's already news from the capital.

00:15:04.683 --> 00:15:06.382
It's been reported
that both Zhang He Nian

00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:09.576
Liu Song Ming and the others
are stirring up chaos.

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:10.727
Let them!

00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:17.758
Only in chaos can we find out
all the factions' true motives.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:19.138
Isn't that right?

00:15:21.489 --> 00:15:23.079
Who are the ones I can recruit?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.799
Who are the ones that must be killed?

00:15:26.299 --> 00:15:30.274
We will find out in time.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.450
<i>Pei Yuan asks
to meet the Elder Statesman.</i>

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:47.662
Elder Statesman,
it's an honor to have you visit us.

00:15:47.663 --> 00:15:49.266
I failed to welcome you sooner.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:50.500
Please don't take it to heart.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.086
There are no outsiders here.

00:15:53.087 --> 00:15:56.529
No need for formalities.

00:15:57.393 --> 00:15:58.793
Thank you, Uncle.

00:16:21.644 --> 00:16:22.917
I'm aware of it.

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:24.119
What's the rush?

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.278
I followed your instructions
to win over the pugilists

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:30.542
with my identity as
a disciple of the Xuanyuan Sect.

00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:32.950
It's been tough on you all these years.

00:16:32.951 --> 00:16:34.782
You've done really well.

00:16:34.783 --> 00:16:36.662
This is just what I should do.

00:16:36.663 --> 00:16:39.762
Besides, Mount Xuanyuan is a
remarkable place that fosters great men.

00:16:39.763 --> 00:16:41.696
It has made my stay here worthwhile.

00:16:41.697 --> 00:16:47.115
I'm afraid there's someone who has
made your stay worthwhile, isn't there?

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:51.388
Uncle, you're teasing me again.

00:17:00.537 --> 00:17:02.122
I knew that you'd come.

00:17:02.123 --> 00:17:04.527
You can't even wait
for such a short time?

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.942
Why did you get so dirty?

00:17:12.943 --> 00:17:14.210
Step off the mat quickly.

00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:15.887
Don't stain my straw mat.

00:17:15.888 --> 00:17:17.897
Isn't it all because of this?

00:17:19.419 --> 00:17:21.374
It really is very rare.

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:22.840
It took me a lot of effort.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:27.045
How could you want it
if it was something ordinary?

00:17:37.018 --> 00:17:38.117
Open your mouth.

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:40.700
Catch it.

00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:46.558
Just swallow it.

00:17:50.483 --> 00:17:51.835
You're not as quick as you used to be.

00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:53.700
It's just one trip
to the Forbidden Cliff.

00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:55.001
It took you so much time.

00:17:55.002 --> 00:17:56.560
Fortunately, you got back in time.

00:17:56.561 --> 00:18:00.200
If you got here much later,
the flower would've been useless.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.817
I ran into a troublesome girl.

00:18:02.818 --> 00:18:04.078
You got rid of her?

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:07.988
She must be a disciple
of the Xuanyuan Sect

00:18:07.989 --> 00:18:09.488
if was at the Forbidden Cliff.

00:18:09.489 --> 00:18:11.489
Weren't you worried
that she might recognize you?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.923
I find her quite interesting.

00:18:15.266 --> 00:18:16.687
This is so unlike you.

00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:19.031
All right, enough about that.

00:18:19.032 --> 00:18:21.863
How long does it take for the
Hundred-layered Orchid to work?

00:18:21.864 --> 00:18:23.601
You can try it now.

00:19:09.321 --> 00:19:11.047
It really is effective.

00:19:11.048 --> 00:19:13.038
Who told you to splash
my floor with water?

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:15.844
You'll feel an unusual stir
in your internal force these days.

00:19:15.845 --> 00:19:16.884
Be careful.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.337
Although the Hundred-layered Orchid
can only enhance superficial abilities

00:19:20.338 --> 00:19:22.651
it's enough to fool Qi Zhen.

00:19:22.652 --> 00:19:24.983
He already tested me once.

00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:27.383
Luckily, I resolved the crisis
with the force of Qiongcang.

00:19:27.384 --> 00:19:28.845
But judging by his suspicious nature

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:31.556
I'm afraid that he'll only put me
through more tests at the capital.

00:19:31.557 --> 00:19:32.585
Don't worry.

00:19:32.586 --> 00:19:33.885
I'll be there for you.

00:19:35.385 --> 00:19:37.799
The heir apparent
will take his leave then.

00:19:38.445 --> 00:19:39.480
I'm off.

00:19:45.763 --> 00:19:47.614
By the way, there's another matter.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.825
<i>That's not the way
to start fire with wood!</i>

00:20:07.826 --> 00:20:09.208
<i>You need more wood!</i>

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:12.355
<i>Put more in!</i>

00:20:12.356 --> 00:20:14.295
<i>Hurry up! Hurry up!</i>

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.827
<i>Fu Yao!</i>

00:20:24.951 --> 00:20:26.108
Where have you been?

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.523
Why are you such a mess?

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:33.620
I tripped and fell down over there.

00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:35.070
<i>You tripped and fell?</i>

00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:36.887
How did you get so dirty
from just tripping?

00:20:36.888 --> 00:20:38.144
It's true. It really hurts.

00:20:38.145 --> 00:20:39.588
Did you get into trouble again?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.599
I didn't.

00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:43.180
- Be honest with me.
- It's fine.

00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:44.752
I'll beat you if you don't tell me!

00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:45.975
Uncle Zhou!

00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.291
They came to prompt us again!

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:49.001
The banquet is about to begin!

00:20:49.002 --> 00:20:50.201
We have to serve the food quickly!

00:20:50.202 --> 00:20:51.382
Exactly!

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.643
Uncle Zhou, hurry up!

00:20:52.644 --> 00:20:54.649
Did you hear that?
The banquet is about to begin!

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:55.749
Go and see to it!

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.211
- Get changed now!
- Yes!

00:20:57.212 --> 00:20:58.558
You should hurry up too!

00:20:58.559 --> 00:20:59.607
Yes, right away!

00:20:59.608 --> 00:21:00.876
Do you all hear me?

00:21:00.877 --> 00:21:03.066
Fu Yao, well? Did you get the flower?

00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:04.237
Don't bring that up.

00:21:04.238 --> 00:21:05.569
- Why?
- Stop bringing it up!

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.994
Why... All right.

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:09.808
What about White?

00:21:13.902 --> 00:21:16.986
His Highness and Elder Statesman
Qi are visiting Mount Xuanyuan.

00:21:16.987 --> 00:21:21.030
It truly is an honor for me
and for Xuanyuan Sect.

00:21:21.031 --> 00:21:23.514
I'll drink a toast
to the both of you first.

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:24.658
Please have a drink.

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:26.375
Chief Yan, please have a drink.

00:21:26.376 --> 00:21:28.180
Your Highness?

00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:34.293
Your Highness!

00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.538
Let's drink!

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:43.914
Are you drinking a toast?

00:21:43.915 --> 00:21:46.873
Feel free. Help yourselves.

00:21:55.465 --> 00:21:56.893
- Mentor.
- Father.

00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.260
Why have you come so late?

00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:03.836
Senior Yan was examining
the food for the banquet.

00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:05.211
That's why he's held up.

00:22:05.212 --> 00:22:06.811
Mentor, please forgive him.

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:09.915
I'm afraid my son is remiss as a host.

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:13.324
Elder Statesman Qi and
Your Highness, please don't mind him.

00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:15.247
Allow me to make the introductions.

00:22:15.248 --> 00:22:16.882
This is...

00:22:16.883 --> 00:22:18.036
Greetings, Uncle.

00:22:27.538 --> 00:22:32.841
Yuan, I haven't seen you in years,
you've grown even prettier.

00:22:32.842 --> 00:22:35.469
Your aunt thought of you a few days ago

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.489
and asked when you'd be able
to meet her at the capital again.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.825
Oh?

00:22:41.339 --> 00:22:43.457
So Elder Statesman Qi is your uncle?

00:22:43.458 --> 00:22:46.599
Commandery Princess,
it was remiss of me to not know of it.

00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:49.002
Mentor, you're too kind.

00:22:49.003 --> 00:22:51.631
Since I'm training
under the Xuanyuan Sect

00:22:51.632 --> 00:22:54.127
I'm not a commandery princess,
but just a disciple here.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.789
Uncle, don't mind me.

00:23:20.325 --> 00:23:22.200
Who is the banquet for?

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.100
They made such a huge fuss over it.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.912
Important guests from the capital.

00:23:27.913 --> 00:23:30.624
One is the Elder Statesman
and the other, the heir apparent.

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:32.494
The heir apparent?

00:23:33.523 --> 00:23:35.922
It's said that he was
the legal first born of Quan City

00:23:35.923 --> 00:23:37.014
here in our commandery.

00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:39.214
The legal first born of Quan City?

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.954
Why does that sound so familiar?

00:23:46.673 --> 00:23:47.787
Junior Pei.

00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:51.084
You're actually Master Qi's niece?

00:23:51.085 --> 00:23:53.285
Why didn't you mention it?

00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:55.760
What is there to mention?

00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:57.740
I'm here to learn skills.

00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:59.893
My identity and social status
shouldn't matter.

00:23:59.894 --> 00:24:02.582
In front of you, I'm just me, Senior.

00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:03.679
Here.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.141
Senior Yan, here's a toast to you.

00:24:06.142 --> 00:24:07.287
Here.

00:24:11.323 --> 00:24:13.522
- Chief Yan.
- Elder Statesman Qi.

00:24:15.176 --> 00:24:16.998
How old is your son?

00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:19.400
My son will turn 20 next year.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.279
Has he made any marriage proposals?

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.659
Not yet.

00:24:33.142 --> 00:24:36.620
Elder Statesman Qi,
please enjoy yourself today.

00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:38.109
You must drink till you drop.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.652
Chief Yan, you're too kind.

00:24:47.335 --> 00:24:50.367
<i>It's said that he was
the legal first born of Quan City.</i>

00:24:50.368 --> 00:24:52.568
<i>Haven't you heard
of first come, first served?</i>

00:24:53.965 --> 00:24:57.615
In my book,
whoever gets it first owns it.

00:24:59.843 --> 00:25:00.885
Save me!

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:03.004
I'm the legal first born
of Quan City, Xuanyuan Min.

00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:04.005
Save me!

00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:07.694
<i>That doesn't seem right?</i>

00:25:12.643 --> 00:25:14.625
Your Highness,
you're charming and handsome.

00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:19.003
Even our servant can't
tear her eyes from you.

00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:27.012
Hey, little one!

00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:28.795
Come here.

00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:30.395
Pour me some wine.

00:25:53.002 --> 00:25:54.512
Do you even know how to serve anyone?

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280
My clothes...

00:26:00.384 --> 00:26:01.825
I have to change out of this.

00:26:06.423 --> 00:26:07.606
Little one!

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:09.392
You made the mess.

00:26:09.393 --> 00:26:10.731
Come help me get changed.

00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:16.563
Shouldn't you head over quickly?

00:26:43.348 --> 00:26:44.473
You, whatever you're called!

00:26:44.474 --> 00:26:46.075
Get me my clothes.

00:26:47.435 --> 00:26:48.471
Go on!

00:26:56.372 --> 00:26:57.417
You.

00:26:57.943 --> 00:26:59.044
Come with me.

00:27:06.468 --> 00:27:07.567
Close the door behind you.

00:27:17.036 --> 00:27:19.282
We meet again after
parting at Forbidden Cliff.

00:27:23.248 --> 00:27:26.048
Your Highness, I don't understand.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.240
Are you really smart
or just pretending to be ignorant?

00:27:34.691 --> 00:27:36.001
I see.

00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:39.768
Your Highness must have
run into my twin sister.

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:41.906
She's mischievous by nature.

00:27:41.907 --> 00:27:44.739
If she has offended
Your Highness in any way

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.164
please don't take it to heart.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:52.296
Your Highness.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.559
Your twin sister?

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.913
You'd even tell such a lie?

00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:11.685
Your Highness, can't you tell
any difference between me and my twin?

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.453
Darn you, little one!

00:28:24.454 --> 00:28:26.094
You even have such tricks up your sleeve.

00:28:28.087 --> 00:28:29.621
I already told you.

00:28:29.622 --> 00:28:32.002
There are gadgets
all around Mount Xuanyuan.

00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:36.304
Did you really think
this was an ordinary room?

00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:39.762
It really is you, you little liar.

00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:45.341
Whether or not I'm a liar,
that's not for sure.

00:28:45.342 --> 00:28:48.656
But you're definitely an impostor.

00:28:48.657 --> 00:28:50.259
Is that so?

00:28:52.428 --> 00:28:55.595
Your probably didn't know
that I'm the only one

00:28:55.596 --> 00:28:56.996
who has met the real heir apparent.

00:28:58.544 --> 00:29:01.665
If I expose you now

00:29:01.666 --> 00:29:04.567
do you think you can
leave the mountain alive?

00:29:06.439 --> 00:29:07.702
You're right.

00:29:07.703 --> 00:29:11.403
How about we make a deal?

00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:14.857
It would have been fine
if you hadn't offended me.

00:29:14.858 --> 00:29:16.368
Everything would have been fine.

00:29:16.369 --> 00:29:18.836
But you robbed me
of my Hundred-layered Orchid.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.180
You just want the orchid back?

00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:26.780
- Where is my flower?
- I ate it.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.942
<i>Your Highness, I've brought your clothes.</i>

00:29:32.682 --> 00:29:34.597
Hey!

00:29:36.163 --> 00:29:40.163
If you expose me now,
won't you be rendering a great merit?

00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:43.489
I still want to get my flower back.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:45.961
I won't get myself in trouble.

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:48.545
<i>Your Highness.
Please get changed quickly.</i>

00:29:48.546 --> 00:29:50.529
<i>They're still waiting
for you at the main hall.</i>

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.313
What are you doing?

00:30:18.314 --> 00:30:19.412
You're very smart.

00:30:19.413 --> 00:30:21.169
Unfortunately, you're too inexperienced.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.912
Did you really think that
the chains could hold me down?

00:30:23.913 --> 00:30:25.113
Your Highness!

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:29.409
Your Highness!

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.871
Don't behave so!

00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:32.557
What's the rush?

00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:34.002
I'm not even undressed yet.

00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:35.426
Forgive me, Your Highness.

00:30:50.241 --> 00:30:51.423
What is that about?

00:30:53.048 --> 00:30:54.940
He's just a fake prince.

00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:56.194
What a bully.

00:30:56.195 --> 00:30:57.203
Fu Yao!

00:30:57.204 --> 00:30:58.681
- What is it?
- White is dying!

00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:00.766
- What's wrong with White?
- Take a look quickly!

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:01.767
Hurry up!

00:31:04.232 --> 00:31:05.545
White!

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:06.644
White!

00:31:06.645 --> 00:31:08.803
White! What's the matter, White?

00:31:08.804 --> 00:31:09.893
White!

00:31:09.894 --> 00:31:12.616
White, if you don't even
make it past this winter

00:31:12.617 --> 00:31:14.451
I won't get to have any of your meat!

00:31:14.452 --> 00:31:15.680
What are you talking about?

00:31:15.681 --> 00:31:17.266
Are you raising White for pork?

00:31:17.267 --> 00:31:20.365
How sad would White be
if it heard you say that?

00:31:20.366 --> 00:31:21.604
What are you doing?

00:31:21.605 --> 00:31:22.733
White...

00:31:24.374 --> 00:31:25.932
What are you doing?

00:31:25.933 --> 00:31:27.731
- Take a look at it.
- What's the matter?

00:31:27.732 --> 00:31:29.210
Something's wrong with White.

00:31:29.211 --> 00:31:31.449
Here, take it.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.025
It's from the heir apparent.

00:31:33.026 --> 00:31:35.732
He said that it's an miraculous cure.

00:31:36.232 --> 00:31:37.680
Will it work?

00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:39.076
Whatever.

00:31:39.077 --> 00:31:40.845
It's as good as
trying to save a dead horse.

00:31:40.846 --> 00:31:42.198
But White is a pig!

00:31:42.199 --> 00:31:43.422
Just feed it quickly!

00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:45.748
All right... White, here's your medicine.

00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:47.329
Be good, White.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.179
Since you're willing to save
White, I'll let you off for now.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.300
Hey! Get up quickly.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.360
No, I have to wait till White is better.

00:31:55.361 --> 00:31:57.698
Seven will take care of White.

00:31:57.699 --> 00:31:59.154
- Come with me.
- No, it won't do.

00:31:59.155 --> 00:32:00.326
Don't worry about it.

00:32:00.327 --> 00:32:01.588
Take good care of White.

00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:02.764
Hurry up!

00:32:02.765 --> 00:32:03.935
Take good care of it!

00:32:03.936 --> 00:32:05.881
Take the medicine.

00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:07.272
You'll be fine after taking it.

00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:08.273
Get going.

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:10.647
Have you forgotten that

00:32:10.648 --> 00:32:12.634
you're Crown Prince Wu Ji
of the Tianquan Kingdom

00:32:12.635 --> 00:32:14.841
and the emperor in line
to govern the five kingdoms?

00:32:14.842 --> 00:32:18.025
Your mission is to pacify the unrest
in one of the vessel kingdoms and not...

00:32:18.026 --> 00:32:20.573
Not traveling and getting
involved in romantic relationships.

00:32:20.574 --> 00:32:25.376
Why did you give away my elixir
to a servant in Xuanyou Division then?

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:30.221
Do you know that I decocted
36 rare flowers in 49 days

00:32:30.222 --> 00:32:32.166
to produce that elixir?

00:32:32.167 --> 00:32:33.639
It's your lifesaver.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.192
That's very generous of you.

00:32:35.193 --> 00:32:37.943
So what? I took from her
so I had to pay it back.

00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:43.108
Now I'm really curious
to know what she's like.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.170
So am I.

00:32:54.603 --> 00:32:56.891
I really didn't get myself
into any trouble lately.

00:32:58.728 --> 00:33:01.547
Do you think that there's something
between me and that prince?

00:33:01.548 --> 00:33:03.097
There's really nothing at all.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.894
I actually just want to tell you that

00:33:05.895 --> 00:33:09.277
it's not busy in Xuanyou Division lately.

00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:11.377
Why don't you take a day off?

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.347
They told me about a market
at the bottom of the mountain.

00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:18.757
It's really bustling.

00:33:18.758 --> 00:33:20.006
Do you want to go there?

00:33:20.007 --> 00:33:21.507
If you do, I'll give you the badge.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:27.435
Get your hands off me!

00:33:27.436 --> 00:33:28.789
You must be ill.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.953
I'll get you White's medicine.

00:33:30.954 --> 00:33:32.200
That's enough.

00:33:32.201 --> 00:33:35.887
Don't always put up a strong front.

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:41.081
I know that although you're
always joking around

00:33:41.082 --> 00:33:45.199
you keep all the unhappiness bottled up.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.605
Right?

00:33:49.457 --> 00:33:50.617
What could possibly upset me?

00:33:54.011 --> 00:33:59.768
Who doesn't have any sad memories?

00:33:59.769 --> 00:34:02.832
I've been through all that.

00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:04.659
You should listen to me.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:11.109
Young Master Yan might treat you well
but you don't belong to the same world.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.299
In the end, you definitely
won't get to be with him.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:19.171
His marital bond with Miss Pei Yuan
is certainly expected...

00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:20.370
Hold on.

00:34:20.371 --> 00:34:22.371
Whose marital bond?

00:34:23.713 --> 00:34:28.064
Didn't Elder Statesman Qi give away
Miss Pei Yuan's hand in marriage

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:32.415
to Young Master Yan during
the welcome banquet today?

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:33.721
You were present.

00:34:33.722 --> 00:34:35.123
You should know about it.

00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:40.115
Pei Yuan... and Senior Yan?

00:34:44.516 --> 00:34:45.850
I'll ask him about it.

00:34:45.851 --> 00:34:46.944
Hey!

00:34:46.945 --> 00:34:48.147
Fu Yao!

00:34:48.148 --> 00:34:49.188
Fu Yao!

00:35:09.878 --> 00:35:10.962
Senior Yan!

00:35:10.963 --> 00:35:12.455
Senior Yan!

00:35:12.456 --> 00:35:14.386
Where is Senior Yan?

00:35:14.387 --> 00:35:15.935
Aren't you too bold?

00:35:15.936 --> 00:35:18.663
How can you come to the Xuanzheng
Division without being summoned?

00:35:18.664 --> 00:35:19.858
I'm here to see Senior Yan.

00:35:21.092 --> 00:35:22.549
What's the point of seeing him now?

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.317
He and Senior Pei will soon...

00:35:24.318 --> 00:35:25.625
- Where's Senior Yan?
- Shush!

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.300
Lower your voice.

00:35:27.301 --> 00:35:30.631
In the past, others in the Xuanzheng
Division didn't dare to trifle with you

00:35:30.632 --> 00:35:32.232
because Young Master Yan took your side.

00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:34.192
But he's marrying Senior Pei very soon.

00:35:34.193 --> 00:35:36.917
Do you know that
Senior Pei has a strong supporter?

00:35:36.918 --> 00:35:39.147
All right, get going now.

00:35:39.148 --> 00:35:41.065
If you don't leave,
I'll be punished for it.

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:43.134
Senior Yan!

00:35:43.135 --> 00:35:45.214
I already told you that he wasn't here.

00:35:45.215 --> 00:35:47.513
If you wish to see him,
go over to Senior Pei's.

00:35:47.514 --> 00:35:49.031
Senior Yan!

00:35:49.032 --> 00:35:50.456
Senior Yan!

00:36:00.797 --> 00:36:03.616
Senior Yan, regarding
Elder Statesman Qi's suggestion

00:36:03.617 --> 00:36:04.843
I think...

00:36:04.844 --> 00:36:06.565
As for that matter...

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.131
It's still too early to discuss that.

00:36:10.132 --> 00:36:12.239
Senior Yan, what is your concern?

00:36:13.827 --> 00:36:15.303
Junior Pei, don't be so sensitive.

00:36:15.304 --> 00:36:19.038
It's just that I have yet
to win the Warrior Hunt.

00:36:19.039 --> 00:36:22.033
Not to mention that I don't hold
a post in the royal court.

00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:24.061
I'm afraid that you
might be aggrieved by it.

00:36:25.255 --> 00:36:26.997
Why would you think
so little of yourself?

00:36:26.998 --> 00:36:30.267
The Warrior Hunt is just a trivial
contest that you can surely win.

00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:33.877
Then, we'll have Elder Statesman
Qi host the wedding for us.

00:36:33.878 --> 00:36:37.023
Our wedding will surely be
a grand occasion in the capital.

00:36:39.764 --> 00:36:40.764
Don't worry.

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.624
My aunt and uncle really dote on me.

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:44.850
As long as you come
with me to the capital

00:36:44.851 --> 00:36:47.751
you'll surely be guaranteed
a promising future.

00:37:23.282 --> 00:37:24.554
What's the matter?

00:37:26.938 --> 00:37:28.541
Everything's fine.

00:37:30.007 --> 00:37:31.113
It's getting windy.

00:37:31.114 --> 00:37:33.514
Why don't I walk you back
to your quarters?

00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:07.645
Senior Yan...

00:38:07.646 --> 00:38:09.847
There's no need to come after me.

00:38:19.092 --> 00:38:20.652
I'm not your Senior Yan.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.270
You... Why is it you?

00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:27.576
Are you still hoping that
your Senior Yan would come after you?

00:38:27.577 --> 00:38:29.976
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:34.622
In this great big world,
I just happened to be right here.

00:38:34.623 --> 00:38:36.023
How is that eavesdropping?

00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:41.300
Besides, I'm not the only one
who overheard you.

00:38:45.525 --> 00:38:46.754
I have a lot on my mind.

00:38:46.755 --> 00:38:48.215
Don't annoy me.

00:38:50.923 --> 00:38:52.414
What is it that you want?

00:38:54.074 --> 00:38:57.399
Little one, I can't be bothered
to worry about your feelings now.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.356
We must put an end to what
we discussed this morning.

00:39:01.775 --> 00:39:03.661
Do you want to silence me?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.224
What a great day.

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.596
First, I'm dumped by Senior Yan.

00:39:16.597 --> 00:39:18.540
Second, I found out about your secret.

00:39:18.541 --> 00:39:20.541
Now you want to kill me.

00:39:22.181 --> 00:39:24.205
I'm just a servant
under the Xuanyou Division.

00:39:24.206 --> 00:39:27.706
I actually ended up getting
in the way of such important people.

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:31.241
Fine.

00:39:31.242 --> 00:39:32.976
Kill me if you wish.

00:39:33.994 --> 00:39:35.280
Are you so eager to die?

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.625
Does what I think even matter?

00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:44.717
Do it.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.559
What on earth is that?

00:40:49.851 --> 00:40:51.052
Quickly!

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
