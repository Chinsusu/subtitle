<i>"Fuyao" by Karen Mok</i>

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.369
♫ <i>I start to dance
trippingly and gracefully</i> ♫

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.539
♫ <i>For what my beautiful face is frowned?</i> ♫

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.660
♫ <i>Without him, I'll drift
with the current</i> ♫

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.859
♫ <i>Why is the tune of the
zither a farewell song?</i> ♫

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.939
♫ <i>Without me, he'll be
lonely in this universe</i> ♫

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.900
♫ <i>My heart silently waits
at the cliff of Firmament</i> ♫

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.549
♫ <i>The heaven, the earth, the sun
and the moon are all in my bosom</i> ♫

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.069
♫ <i>How can I own the top
freedom in this world?</i> ♫

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.739
♫ <i>There is no fear from my heart</i> ♫

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.789
♫ <i>Deep love won't hide</i> ♫

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.969
♫ <i>True love won't run short</i> ♫

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.089
♫ <i>Dreams give hopes through all the ages</i> ♫

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.599
♫ <i>Why go through storms and stress
to be bright and beautiful?</i> ♫

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.359
♫ <i>There is no struggle from my heart</i> ♫

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.439
♫ <i>Swaying along with the wind</i> ♫

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.440
♫ <i>I can do anything freely</i> ♫

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.879
♫ <i>I enter my dreams easily
and unrestrainedly</i> ♫

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.270
♫ <i>What a beautiful dance</i> ♫

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.510
<i>~ Episode 2 ~</i>

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.100
Your Highness, the King has conferred
you Heir Apparent of Too-Deep.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.779
Is this for real?

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.930
What do you think?

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.350
Great. Great.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.510
I'll be this king then.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.949
Why did adoptive father spare his life?

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.869
And even let him become the heir apparent?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.250
This person is just an idiot. It
can't be that adoptive father...

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.899
Yun Hen, have you take care of the matters
that I ordered for you to handle?

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.669
All of the troops in the capital have
complied to your order to stay put.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.790
How is the king?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.719
Ever since taking the medicine, the
king has been in a lethargic sleep.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.089
I am afraid that it's hard
for him to wake up again.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.729
But the imperial doctor said that he will definitely
live until the day of the heir apparent's enthronement.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.050
- It's just that—
- It's just that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.829
you don't know why we are
so close to succeeding,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.119
and yet I am stopping
all of a sudden, right?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.329
You must have your reasons.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.469
I've put so much effort into
planning for this long,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.929
and yet I overlooked this only matter.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.849
<i>Even if you killed me,</i>

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.469
<i>when the throne is empty, then
the royal power of Too-Deep</i>

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.550
<i>will once again go back and
belong to Megrez Nation.</i>

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.039
<i>What did you say?</i>

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.449
<i>If the royalties die off, then
the nation will also be over.</i>

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.089
<i>That's the original rules
set for the five regions.</i>

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.019
<i>How would an outsider
like you know about it?</i>

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.149
<i>Today, if our Xuanyuan clan dies off,</i>

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.640
<i>Too-Deep will then become a swamp nation.</i>

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.019
Since we haven't gained Water
Manipulation Technique,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.729
we are only left with the choice of supporting
this idiot heir apparent currently.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.669
About his background, have
you investigated thoroughly?

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.279
I already appointed people
to inquire all about it.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.459
They say that this Xuanyuan Min have a wealthy
and comfortable life since he was little.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.399
After the death of the old prince,
he would either just sing around,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.159
or hang out and gamble
with a pack of rogues.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.719
The vast wealth of his family
was gone just like that.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.829
And he even has quite a few debts.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.100
A useless prodigal son like him,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.289
theoretically, is most fitted for
the position of a heir apparent.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.729
It's just that this person is probably
not as simple as what we see.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.729
Does Adoptive Father still
have doubts about him?

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.779
The Xuanyuan clan are born with
the ability to manipulate water.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.179
I've tested it earlier.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.619
However, this simplest Water
Manipulation Technique

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.329
aside from Xuanyuan clan,

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.669
if you learn a bit of Firmament
Technique, you would be able to show it.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.709
Now, the bloodline of Xuanyuan
will be terminated soon.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.360
We can only leave him to be in the
position of the heir apparent.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.649
Appoint someone to find out if
there are any news with Feiyan.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.560
Yes.

00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.049
Remember.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.509
Before getting any additional information,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.809
this Xuanyuan Min must not go to
Capital Kun to ascend to the throne.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.509
Yes, sir.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.259
Doing laundry as a punishment to me?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.670
A great opportunity for me to test out if
this machine that I just made works well.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.679
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.069
Hurry! Hurry!

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.899
- Hurry and go save Xiaobai!
- What happened to Xiaobai?

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.939
It got sick again! It has been
mumbling for most of the day.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.059
If this continues...

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.349
Let's hurry and find someone
to take a look at it, okay?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.219
I will go find First Senior Brother!

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.859
Why would First Senior Brother
care about things like this?

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.309
Let's think of another way.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.299
I think if this goes on, it
won't make it through tonight!

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.160
Don't speak nonsense!

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.740
I'll think of a solution. You guard here.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.989
You can't be going on the mountain to
pick that flower, right? That flower is...

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.529
Lower your volume!

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.759
You can't! You can't!

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.009
You know already that the flower
grows on the forbidden cliff.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.999
Aside from the leader and a few
elders, no one else is allowed to go!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.409
If you get found out, you will be in big trouble!
Not even First Senior Brother can save you then!

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.099
And you know how dangerous that place is!

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.019
Stop talking!

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.889
This isn't my first time
to the forbidden cliff!

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.429
Do you not want to save Xiaobai's life?

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.910
Guard here! I will be back soon!

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.239
Don't you know the rule of
first come first serve?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.690
My rule is that it belong to
the person who gets it first.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.000
The Kung Fu taught by Mt. Mystic
Soul is not that great after all.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.420
You!

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.249
This forbidden cliff of Mt.
Mystic Soul does eat people!

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.149
They are just a few vines.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.289
Do you really think I can't get out?

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.220
Why don't you try then?

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.549
There are a lot of birds
and beasts around here.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.959
In a bit, they will come and
have you as a big meal.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.970
All right. Let's say I lost.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.149
May I ask what I need to do
in order for you to save me?

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.359
It'd been much better if you
were this obedient before.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.679
If you give me the flower
now, then I will save you.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.359
Why should I believe you?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.429
Why should you believe me?

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:51.009
Do you have anything to bargain with me?

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.119
All right. I am dying no matter what.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.689
Then why don't I just eat
this Baizhi Orchid now?

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.210
Don't!

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.559
I will save you then!

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.300
Hurry!

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.360
- Catch it!
- Come on.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.210
Use some strength!

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.469
Use your strength!

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.860
I am using my strength!

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.709
How come you fell down?

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.139
I just saved you earlier.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.059
Why are you taking revenge?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.829
You were the one who let go.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.109
Did I do anything?

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.439
I didn't do anything.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.290
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a second!

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.899
Can you leave the flower behind?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.439
Girl, there is no room
for you to negotiate.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.439
You won't be able to sell this
flower for a lot of money.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.000
I'm using it to save someone's life.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.250
You're on your own. Good luck. See you.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.020
<i>Come back!</i>

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.330
Bastard! Come back!

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.090
Come back!

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.680
Leave the flower behind! Bastard!

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.369
The hunting game concerns the
grand future of our Mystic Soul.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.310
Have you thought it through?

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.379
Of course, I understand its importance.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.099
Please rest assured, Father.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.239
In this competition, the different skilled warriors and
nobility from the five regions will all gather here.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.389
You will be the clique leader of
Mystic Soul Clique in the future.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.029
Romantic follies will only drag you down.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.350
You should weigh it yourself.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.259
Father, you're overthinking.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.550
Although I've always shown
excessive care towards Fuyao,

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.810
she is still just a slave from the
Mystic Black Section after all.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.590
The pros and cons behind this,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.810
I understand.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.189
This Celestial Fangding is a mythical
item left by the ancient people.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:26.109
It will only be taken out and offered during
the every 8 years hunting game of our clique.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.839
I've long heard that Mt. Mystic Soul
is hiding a lot of skilled fighters.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.509
That the Hunting Game is an
exciting and spectacular event.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.459
We came this time is a coincidence.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.680
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.919
At that time, all the Wulin personage of Too-Deep
will come here to watch the competition.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.069
Since I was here in time for it, of course,
I mustn't miss such a grand event.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.559
I'll stay a few more days then.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.979
I think Heir Apparent will
be interested in this, too.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.600
It's also good to see the different
noble warriors of Mt. Mystic Soul.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.550
Adoptive Father, will we really stay here?

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.579
But the capital has sent news

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.599
that Zhang Henian, Liu Songmin, and other
people are making strange movements.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.739
I fear that trouble might erupt.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.010
Let it erupt then!

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.689
Only when chaos starts will we know the
intentions of the different parties.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.310
Am I right?

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.549
Who can be used by me and who must die,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.009
it will be very clear by then.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.610
<i>Pei Yuan asks to see the Prime Minister.</i>

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.419
I failed to welcome Prime
Minister during your arrival.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.349
Please forgive me, Prime Minister.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.229
There are no outsiders here.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.709
Just drop the troublesome formalities.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.640
Thank you, Uncle.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.899
I know. What are you anxious for?

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.769
I've followed your instructions to use my identity as a
disciple of the sect to win over jianghu warriors to our side.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.289
You've worked hard these few years.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.079
You did quite well.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.869
This is what I should do.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.849
Moreover, this Mt. Mystic Soul is indeed a
rich land that's full of illustrious heroes.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.149
My trip here wasn't for vain.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:48.080
I fear that there's another person that made
your trip here not in vain. Am I right?

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.340
Uncle, you're mocking me again.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.899
I've known early on that you're here.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.661
You just waited for a few minutes
and you're already being impatient?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.259
Why are you so dirty?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.519
Quickly go down.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.739
Don't dirty my mat.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.840
It's all because of this.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.989
It is indeed a rare item. I
exerted a lot to get it.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.040
If it's a normal item, how
can it be needed by you?

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.579
Open your mouth.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.180
Catch it.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.480
Swallow it.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.289
You've become slower. It's just getting into a
restricted cliff, why did you spend so much time?

00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:01.020
Good thing you came back in time. If you came back
later then this flower would of been useless.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.329
I've encountered a troublesome girl.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.050
<i>Did you take care of her?</i>

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.740
Since she can enter the restricted cliff, she must be a disciple
of Xuanyuan. Aren't you afraid that she'll recognize you?

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.549
I'm think she's quite interesting.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.349
This doesn't seem like you.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:22.559
Okay already. Let's not talk about that anymore. How
many days will it take for this Baizhilan to work?

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.740
You can try it now.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.339
It indeed worked.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.889
Who told you to splash water on my floor?

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.679
Your inner energy will be a bit messy
these next few days. Be careful.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:23.279
Although this baizhilan can only provice some
superficial effects, it's enough to fool Qi Zhen.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.469
He already tested me last time. Good thing, I was
able to resolve it using Qingcang technique.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.679
But with his paranoid characteristic, I fear
that he'll do more tests when we reach Kunjing.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.830
Don't worry, I'll keep you company.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.889
I, the Heir Apparent,
will then take my leave.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.480
I'm leaving.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.790
By the way, there's something else.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.609
Hey... I'm talking to you.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:10.310
- You shouldn't burn logs like that. You should put in more logs.
- Okay...

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.680
- Put more.
- I know already.
- Hurry up!

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.560
<i>Fuyao!</i>

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.380
Where did you go? How did
you end up like this?

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.269
I really just slipped.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.589
Slipped? You can end up in
this state just by slipping?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.309
Really. It really hurts.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.659
Did you cause trouble again?

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.609
- I didn't.
- Tell the truth.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.399
- I wouldn't.
- If you say it then I'll hit you!

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.419
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou! The front
manor is rushing us again!

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.249
The banquet is starting soon,
and we must set the table.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.619
- Right...
- Let's hurry, Uncle Zhou.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.869
Did you hear? The banquet
is starting soon, go serve.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.809
- Hurry and go change your clothes.
- I'll change.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.699
- <i>You, also hurry up.
- Alright. Immediately.</i>

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.349
- Did you all hear that? The banquet will be starting soon?
- Sister Fuyao, how about it? Did you get the flower?

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.849
- Don't mention it.
- Why not?

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.719
Don't mention it!

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.629
Did you all hear it?! Be nimble!

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.390
What about Xiaobai?

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.389
Your Highness Heir Apparent and Prime
Minister came here to our Xuanyuan Mountain.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.289
It is my honor and our
Xuanyuan's great fortune.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.359
Let me offer you two a toast first.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.399
Sect Leader Yan, cheers.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.490
Crown Prince...

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.809
Crown Prince, Your Highness...

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.700
Drink!

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.190
Is everyone offering a toast?
Just do as you like.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.369
- Master.
- Father.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.550
Why are you so late?

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.239
Eldest Senior went to check the
food for the banquet earlier.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.489
Hence, we got delayed.
May Teacher forgive us.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:14.189
My son caused us delay. May Prime
Minister and Heir Apparent forgive him.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.879
Let me introduce them, this is...

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.060
Uncle.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.319
Yuan'er, after not seeing you for so
many years, you've grown more energetic.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.379
A few days ago, your aunt was asking

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.690
when you will meet her again.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.029
So Prime Minister is your uncle.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.119
Commander Princess, I wasn't able
to give you proper treatment.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.099
Teacher, what are you saying?
Since I've joined the sect,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.569
there then isn't a Commandery Princess
here, just a teacher and his disciple.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.780
Uncle, don't mind it.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:25.250
Hey, for whom was this banquet today
set up for? It's quite grand.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.349
Important people from Kunjing, one Prime
Minister and the other one is the Heir Apparent.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.909
There's even a Heir Apparent?

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.669
I heard that he was originally a royal relative
living in Quandu here in our commandery.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.959
A royal relative from Quandu?

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.160
How come it sounds so familiar?

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.649
Junior Sister, so you're Lord Qi's niece?

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.899
How come you never mentioned it before?

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.179
What's there to mention about?
I came here to learn skills.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.769
It's not important what my identity
or status is. In front of you,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.749
I am still me. Come, Eldest Senior.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.210
- I give you a toast.
- Come.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.660
- Sect Leader Yuan.
- Prime Minister.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.689
How old is your son?

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.249
My son is about 20 years old.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.739
Is he married?

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.290
Not yet.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.859
Prime Minister, you must enjoy yourself
to your heart's content today.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.590
You mustn't leave until you're drunk.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.930
Sect Leader, you are being so polite.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.419
<i>I heard that he was originally a royal relative
from Quandu that's part of our commandery.</i>

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.359
<i>Do you know about first come, first serve?</i>

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.750
<i>My rule is it belongs to
he whoever gets it first.</i>

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:05.020
<i>Save me. I am Xuanyuan Min, a royal
descendant living in Quandu. Save me.</i>

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.920
<i>Something's off.</i>

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:17.959
Heir Apparent is so elegant and handsome.
Even our servant here

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.350
can't take her eyes off you.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.460
Hey, maidservant! Come here.
Pour me some wine.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:43.010
Timing and Subtitles brought to you
by Fuyao's Court Team @ Viki.com

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.810
Do you know how to serve people?!

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.940
These clothes... I must change them.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:11.930
Hey, maidservant! You caused this trouble.
Quickly come to help me change my clothing.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.700
Hurry and go.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:49.410
That person over there. Go
and get me some clothes. Go!

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:00.270
You. Come in with me.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.670
Close the doors.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.660
After parting last time, we meet again.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:27.190
What is Heir Apparent saying?
I don't understand it.

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.490
Are you just really smart
or faking to be naive?

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:40.589
I know already. Heir Apparent
must have met my twin.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:46.129
She's naturally mischievous and naughty.
If she has offended you,

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.420
may you forgive her.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.550
Heir Apparent...

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.739
Twin sister?

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.280
You're able to make such a lie?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.339
Heir Apparent, could it be...

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.770
you didn't notice any
differences between us?

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.100
You trickster. You even have such a move?

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.979
I already told you that here in Xuanyuan
Mountain, there are traps everywhere.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.450
You really think that
this is an ordinary room?

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.080
It is indeed you, little trickster.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.319
Whether I'm a trickster or not,
we can't be sure. But you...

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.649
surely is a fake.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.869
- Really?
- Yes.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:57.580
You probably don't know that only
I saw the real Heir Apparent.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.709
If I tell them now your real identity,

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.660
guess if you'll be able to
leave this mountain alive.

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.929
What you said is right.
Why don't we make a deal?

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.869
If you didn't provoke me, I won't provoke
you too. We both will be alright.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.580
But who told you to steal
my 100 years iris-orchid?

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.579
You just want that back?

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.059
- Where is my flower?
- I ate it.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.160
<i>Your Highness Heir Apparent,
I've brought you your clothes.</i>

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.409
Hey...

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.290
If you go out now and expose me,
won't you have achieve great merit?

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.789
I still want my flower back. I
won't bring myself trouble.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.630
<i>Your Highness Heir Apparent, please hurry and change your
clothes. They are still waiting for you in the front courtyard.</i>

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.899
- What are you doing?
- Too bad, your skills are still too shallow.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.519
You really think that those
chains will be able to bind me?

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.490
Your Highness Heir Apparent.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.939
Your Highness Heir Apparent,
don't be like this.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.399
Why are you rushing? I
haven't even undressed.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.590
Your Highness Heir Apparent,
please forgive me.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.440
What was that?

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.539
He clearly was a fake Heir Apparent.
Such a bully.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.979
- Sister Fuyao! - What is it? - Xiaobai is a goner soon!
Quickly go check him! - What's wrong with Xiaobai?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.490
- What's wrong with Xiaobai?!
- Hurry!

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.899
- Xiaobai!
- Xiaobai...

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.529
- Xiaobai, how are you?
- Xiaobai...

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.969
Xiaobai, you haven't even
live past the winter yet.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.929
- I won't even be able to taste your meat!
- What are you saying?

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.269
- Did we raise Xiaobai just for you to eat it?
If Xlaobai knows you're like this, - Xiaobai...

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.899
- how sad will it be?
- What are you two doing?
- Xiaobai...

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.119
- Xiaobai...
- Hey! Hey!

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.909
- What are you two doing?!
- Please check him!

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.360
- Xiaobai...
- Don't know what's wrong with Xiaobai.
- Here.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.759
That was given by Heir Apparent.
He said that it's a miracle drug.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.639
Can that work?

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.259
I don't care anymore. Let's just
treat a dead horse like a live one.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.639
- He clearly is a pig!
- Just give it!

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.089
Xiaobai, it's time to eat
your medicine. Quick.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.769
- Xiaobai, come.
- Considering that you saved Xiaobai, I won't make you pay for now.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.739
Hey... go back to work.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.669
No. I want to see Xiaobai get better first.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.329
Jeez, Xiaobai has Xiaoqi taking care of it.
Quickly come with me.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.629
- No. I...
- Be obedient.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.959
- Take good care of Xiaobai.
- Okay...
- Hurry!

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.349
- Take good care o it.
- Come.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:10.139
- It's time to take your medicine. You'll be fine afterwards.
- Quickly move.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.029
Have you forgotten that your identity
is Megrez Empire's Crown Prince Wuji?

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:17.569
A crown prince that will unite the five continents in the
future. Your duty is to pacify the unrest in the vassal states.

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:21.359
- And not— - In a leisure travel
and having romantic follies?

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:26.589
Why then did you ask me to give the Immortal Dew I
gave you to a servant from the Xuanyou Section?

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.299
Do you know that I had to gather the dew
of 36 different kinds of unique flowers

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.729
and took 49 days to make that Immortal Dew?

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.689
It's a life-saving medicine for your
future use. But you are quite generous.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.200
What? Of course, one must
return what you steal.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:44.270
I really am very curious to
what kind of person she is.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.360
I also am very curious.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:58.090
I really didn't cause trouble.

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.359
Did you think that I have something
going on with that Heir Apparent?

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:10.029
I actually wanted to say that
Xuan You Cave has not been busy.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.410
Why don't you rest for a while?

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.089
He told me that there's
going to be a competition.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.490
Do you want to go? If you want
to go, I can give you a badge.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.789
Stop stop stop.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:29.609
You must be ill.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:31.509
I'll bring Xiaobai's medicine.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:37.019
Cut it out. You should stop acting tough.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.659
I know you fool around all day,

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:47.630
but you are actually hiding many sorrows.

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.670
What is it?

00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:00.849
Actually, everyone has a few sorrows

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:05.329
I have been there. You must listen to me.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.249
Don't rely too much on the fact that
Young Master treats you very well.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.509
But you two are not of the same path.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.979
You definitely won't be
able to end together.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:18.079
His engagement with miss Peiyuan,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:21.249
- this has already been set.
- Wait.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.490
Who's engaged with who?

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.279
At today's banquet,

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.609
didn't Prime Minister say to marry
off Miss Pei Yuan to Young Master?

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.000
You were there. You should know.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.629
Peiyuan and senior brother?

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.210
Yes.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.259
I'll go ask him.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:50.340
Wait, Fuyao!

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.909
Senior brother! Where is he?

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.719
Aren't you too audacious?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.909
How could you come to the Xuanzheng
Section without being called?

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.920
I'm here to find senior brother.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:24.639
What use is there in finding him?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.409
Where is he?

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:30.119
Lower down your voice. Before, people here in Xuanzheng
Section wouldn't dare to do anything to you,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.889
that is because Young
Master is protecting you.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.579
Now that Young Master is getting
married with Senior Sister Pei soon,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.659
do you know what kind of important
person is behind Senior Sister Pei?

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.389
Please leave soon, otherwise
I'll be punished.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:43.659
Eldest Senior!

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.409
I said it already that
Young Master isn't here.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.289
If you want to find him, go
to Senior Sister Pei's place.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.470
Eldest Senior! Eldest Senior!

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:04.289
Senior Brother, about the
suggestion of Prime Minister,

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.540
- I am thinking—
- About this matter...

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.839
This matter is too soon to be discussed.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.250
Senior Brother, do you still
have any apprehensions?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:19.619
Junior Sister, don't overthink. I just
hasn't won the Tiandou Competition yet.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.989
There isn't a space in the
royal court yet for me.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.449
I fear that I might just make you suffer.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.399
Eldest Brother, why must
you belittle yourself?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.129
You surely can easily get the top prize
in a measly Tiandou Competition.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:35.119
By then, we'll let Prime Minister
head our wedding. Our wedding

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.910
will surely become a
major event in Kunjing.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.159
Don't worry. Uncle and
Auntie dotes me a lot.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.469
As long as you come back
with me to Kunjing,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.760
you surely will have a
bright future ahead of you.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.370
What's wrong?

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.490
Oh... nothing.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:34.849
It's becoming windy. Why
don't I take you back?

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.240
Okay.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.710
Eldest Senior, no need to chase me anymore.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.570
I'm not your Eldest Senior.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.799
You... How come it's you?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.519
You still were looking forward that it was your
Eldest Senior that's chasing you. Am I right?

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.900
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.750
In this vast world, I just happen to be
there. How can that count as eavesdropping?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.270
Moreover, it wasn't only me who heard it.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.950
I'm very annoyed right now. Don't anger me.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.420
What do you want?

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.029
Little girl, I don't care
about your mood right now.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.280
We must have a closure on
what happened this morning.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.730
You want to silence me?

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.629
What celebratory day is today?

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:19.419
First, I blocked Eldest Senior future.
Next, I learned about your secret.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:21.370
You want to kill me?

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:25.149
I'm just a slave from the Xuanyou Section,

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.520
yet I've become a stumbling stone
for major people like you.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.199
Fine. Just kill me then.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.130
You want to die that much?

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.620
Is what I think that important?

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.550
Just do it.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.430
What's that thing?

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.580
Hurry!
