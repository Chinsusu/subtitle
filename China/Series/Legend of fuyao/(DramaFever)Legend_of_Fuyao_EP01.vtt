00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.539
<i>Do you know how the five
kingdoms came into existence?</i>

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.836
<i>The Tianquan Kingdom was authorized
by the Sacred Land of Qiongcang</i>

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:48.654
<i>to lead the Taiyuan Kingdom,
Xuanji Kingdom, and Tiansha Kingdom.</i>

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.971
<i>The kingdoms prospered
and the people were at peace.</i>

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:53.140
<i>However, a thousand years ago</i>

00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:55.723
<i>Di Fei Tian ordered the massacre
of the five kingdoms</i>

00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:57.685
<i>plunging the people into great misery.</i>

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:02.306
<i>The Elder of Qiongcang,
Chang Qing Zi, used the Spiritual Elixir</i>

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:04.763
<i>to turn the war around.</i>

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.763
<i>However, Di Fei Tian
wasn't completely eliminated.</i>

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:17.644
<i>His last drop of blood coagulated
into a quintuple-color pebble.</i>

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.984
<i>Now, Di Fei Tian's power
is beginning to stir.</i>

00:02:21.985 --> 00:02:25.984
<i>The one to wake him
will be a young girl</i>

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.586
<i>who has the quintuple-color pebble.</i>

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.595
You're the successor
of the Spiritual Elixir.

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:38.726
Only you can find
that young girl and change destiny.

00:02:38.727 --> 00:02:41.399
Otherwise, the five kingdoms
will be thrown into eternal doom

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.700
because of her.

00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:51.706
Who is it?

00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:52.881
Fu Yao!

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.726
The third stage of the
Xuanyuan Secret Chamber

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:57.407
can only be passed by the one
who retrieves the Xuanyuan Seal.

00:03:57.408 --> 00:03:58.491
Sure.

00:03:58.492 --> 00:03:59.693
I'll give it a try then.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:21.929
How dare you!

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.545
Aren't you going to greet your senior?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.052
Senior Pei, you really
show no mercy, huh?

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.953
How is a menial servant
of the Xuanyou Division

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:34.051
fit to address me as her senior?

00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:36.558
Don't think you're on the same level

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.063
just because Senior Yan
taught you a stance or two.

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:41.836
A servant will always be a servant.

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.011
On the same level?

00:06:45.012 --> 00:06:46.441
Sure.

00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:50.638
It's such a pity, I was
so close to mastering that stage.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.054
In your dreams!

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:54.232
You violated the
regulations of Xuanyuan Sect

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:57.244
by practicing unauthorized in the
Secret Chamber of the Five Elements.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:59.852
I must have you tied up
and brought to the Chief today.

00:06:59.853 --> 00:07:03.111
I'd like to see who'll
put in a good word for you.

00:07:03.112 --> 00:07:04.775
Hold on!

00:07:04.776 --> 00:07:08.152
Senior Pei, I did violate the regulations

00:07:08.153 --> 00:07:13.034
but if you're taking me to the Chief,
you'll need evidence to prove it.

00:07:13.035 --> 00:07:15.212
You'll need evidence to catch me.

00:07:15.213 --> 00:07:17.654
How dare you act so stubborn
when your last hour is upon you!

00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:25.056
A-Lie! Tie her up!

00:07:25.057 --> 00:07:26.057
Yes!

00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:42.820
She really is stupid.

00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:44.751
We're right on the edge of a cliff.

00:07:44.752 --> 00:07:47.321
Jump out if you can.

00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:48.887
I'm so scared.

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.325
But since you told me
to do so, Senior Pei

00:07:52.326 --> 00:07:54.375
I'll just obey your orders.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.508
Young Mistress...

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:06.992
Idiot.

00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:11.278
That lowly servant...

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.730
I won't let you off!

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:47.238
Senior Yan!

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:48.433
Fu Yao?

00:08:48.434 --> 00:08:50.422
I saw someone approaching from afar.

00:08:50.423 --> 00:08:51.639
I just knew it would be you.

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:54.729
Why did you sneak
down the mountain again?

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.471
How many times have I told you?

00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:57.971
You can't sneak down the mountain.

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.338
If they find out, you'll be...

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:00.690
I know! But I miss you.

00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.193
You're so full of nonsense!

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:05.484
Senior Yan.

00:09:05.485 --> 00:09:06.580
Junior Pei.

00:09:06.581 --> 00:09:10.599
Senior Yan, you can't
defend that lowly slave again.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.523
She actually dared
to trespass into the secret chamber

00:09:13.524 --> 00:09:14.854
to practice our swordsmanship.

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:17.884
When she fled from the mountain,
she violated numerous regulations.

00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:20.133
I have to report
this matter to the Chief.

00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:21.793
She must be punished immediately.

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.488
Is that true?

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:30.394
You...

00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.114
You're always so willful.

00:09:35.414 --> 00:09:37.704
Junior Pei, Fu Yao is still young.

00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:38.971
She can't help but be playful.

00:09:38.972 --> 00:09:40.672
How about this?

00:09:40.673 --> 00:09:41.899
Just let her off.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.033
Senior Yan!

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:44.940
You're always defending her!

00:09:44.941 --> 00:09:48.499
That's why this lowly slave from Xuanyou
Division keeps behaving more impetuously!

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:50.681
Do we still abide by the
regulations of Mount Xuanyuan?

00:09:50.682 --> 00:09:54.163
Speaking of the regulations,
Senior Pei Yuan broke them too.

00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:55.405
You... How dare you!

00:09:56.326 --> 00:09:57.326
Am I wrong?

00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.859
The sacrificial ritual is today.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.172
All of Xuanzheng Division's disciples
should be standing by on the mountain.

00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:06.648
Senior Pei Yuan is the first female
disciple of Xuanzheng Division after all.

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:08.566
Why did she sneak
down the mountain too?

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:09.825
You...

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.208
Junior Pei!

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:14.993
You were right to reprimand her.

00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:18.844
I'll report this to the Chief later
and make sure that she's punished.

00:10:21.658 --> 00:10:22.658
You!

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:25.062
When you head back to Xuanyou Division

00:10:25.063 --> 00:10:27.196
stand in the corner
and reflect on your mistakes.

00:10:27.197 --> 00:10:30.617
I'll be sure to punish you later.

00:10:30.618 --> 00:10:32.757
Head back now!

00:10:32.758 --> 00:10:34.152
Yes.

00:10:36.118 --> 00:10:37.306
Senior Yan!

00:10:37.307 --> 00:10:39.819
Why did you let her leave?

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.883
Junior Pei!

00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:55.853
It's almost time.

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:59.373
Why don't you come with me
to the sacrificial ritual?

00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:01.224
<i>The sacrificial ritual...</i>

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:22.843
- Greetings, Mentor.
- Greetings, Mentor.

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:46.575
Today, here in Xuanyuan Sect

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:48.553
the Warrior Hunt will be held once again.

00:11:48.554 --> 00:11:51.153
Under the blessing of the heavens,
we're graced with their kindness.

00:11:51.154 --> 00:11:53.159
As the deceased mentors watch over us

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.885
I, Yan Lie, ask them
to bless Xuanyuan Sect

00:11:56.886 --> 00:11:58.985
in bringing peace to Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:11:58.986 --> 00:12:00.702
May we dominate the five kingdoms again!

00:12:04.188 --> 00:12:08.450
Bless Xuanyuan Sect in bringing
peace to Taiyuan Kingdom!

00:12:08.451 --> 00:12:10.596
May we dominate the five kingdoms again!

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:14.815
<i>Listen up.</i>

00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:16.885
<i>Although Xuanyuan Sect is</i>

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:19.850
<i>a major sect in the pugilist world</i>

00:12:19.851 --> 00:12:25.476
only the ones on the
mountain in Xuanzheng Division

00:12:25.477 --> 00:12:27.384
can practice martial arts.

00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:32.124
Only the disciples born into noble and
prestigious families are entitled to it.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.724
As for us, we're of Xuanyou Division.

00:12:37.725 --> 00:12:40.473
What is Xuanyou Division in charge of?

00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:43.825
We're in charge of attending to others.

00:12:43.826 --> 00:12:46.798
Get this all cleaned up.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:47.799
Uncle Zhou.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.648
Uncle Zhou, this is
the outfit you asked for.

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:50.763
All right.

00:12:50.764 --> 00:12:52.320
Here, hold it.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:55.884
Let me put it this way.

00:12:55.885 --> 00:13:03.685
Whoever dresses in this color
is of the lowest rank.

00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:06.885
When you see anyone
dressed in other colors

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.166
you must step aside.

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:10.243
Come here.

00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:13.826
Listen.

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:19.784
You'll be fed and given accommodation.

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:22.936
You won't have
to stay out in the rain and wind.

00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:26.652
What a blessing that is!

00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:30.763
You should work hard.

00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:32.930
Don't think about useless matters.

00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:37.523
Don't be like the leader
of the children here, Fu Yao.

00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:40.945
Listen up, that Fu Yao...

00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:49.681
Where is Fu Yao?

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:52.854
Where is Fu Yao?

00:13:52.855 --> 00:13:55.598
Where did Fu Yao go?

00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:59.172
<i>Bless Xuanyuan Sect
in bringing peace to Taiyuan Kingdom!</i>

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:01.223
<i>May we dominate the five kingdoms again!</i>

00:14:01.224 --> 00:14:05.077
<i>Bless Xuanyuan Sect
in bringing peace to Taiyuan Kingdom!</i>

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.081
<i>May we dominate the five kingdoms again!</i>

00:14:07.082 --> 00:14:08.369
You scared me to death, Fu Yao.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.643
What took you so long?

00:14:09.644 --> 00:14:11.393
You look quite handsome in this.

00:14:11.394 --> 00:14:12.747
What about mine?

00:14:12.748 --> 00:14:13.951
It's in here.

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:17.816
It would be good if we go
unrecognized in the green gowns.

00:14:17.817 --> 00:14:20.718
But if they catch us peeking
into the Chief's sacrificial ritual

00:14:20.719 --> 00:14:22.518
who knows how they'll kill us?

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:24.487
There are so many people
in the Xuanzheng Division.

00:14:24.488 --> 00:14:26.325
Who would pay attention
to every disciple?

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:30.935
You'll look more suspicious
if you look that anxious.

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:31.984
Learn from me.

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:33.798
Right, no one will recognize me.

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:36.596
But you're so mischievous.
Who doesn't know you?

00:14:36.597 --> 00:14:39.231
The contest is only held
once every eight years.

00:14:39.232 --> 00:14:41.404
Don't you want to see the ritual?

00:14:41.405 --> 00:14:43.013
Learn a thing or two.

00:14:43.014 --> 00:14:45.144
If I'd known you'd be like this,
I wouldn't have brought you.

00:14:45.145 --> 00:14:46.607
No... I'll come along.

00:16:03.225 --> 00:16:08.694
Starting today, Xuanyuan Sect's
internal contest will accept candidates.

00:16:08.695 --> 00:16:13.960
All disciples who are of age, be it
those in white, green, or red gowns

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:16.508
you're all eligible
to participate in the Warrior Hunt

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:18.156
regardless of your lineage.

00:16:18.157 --> 00:16:22.384
The Warrior Hunt was first
held by our founding mentor.

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:25.878
It was designed to select
the most outstanding disciple

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:29.433
in hopes of protecting our people
from bandits and beasts.

00:16:29.434 --> 00:16:31.321
The winner will become a hero.

00:16:31.322 --> 00:16:32.671
What is a hero?

00:16:32.672 --> 00:16:36.364
One who gathers the spirit of nature
and releases it in the form of force.

00:16:36.365 --> 00:16:39.167
The winner of this year's
contest will become a hero.

00:16:39.168 --> 00:16:41.689
The winner shall be honored
with the glory of Xuanyuan Sect

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.622
and become an influential pillar
of strength to the Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:16:44.623 --> 00:16:47.859
The contest will not only prove you
worthy of honor, but also challenge you.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.776
Disciples who wish
to participate in the contest

00:16:49.777 --> 00:16:54.006
must drop their blood-signed tickets
into the Armillary Cauldron.

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:55.286
Once you decide to participate

00:16:55.287 --> 00:16:57.486
you will risk your life
in the Warrior Hunt.

00:16:57.488 --> 00:16:58.606
You're not to regret it.

00:16:58.607 --> 00:17:00.328
Regardless of your lineage...

00:17:01.506 --> 00:17:04.156
They still look down
on our Xuanyou Division.

00:17:06.497 --> 00:17:07.696
Am I wrong?

00:17:09.017 --> 00:17:10.518
Are you sick of living?

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:11.629
Leave now!

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.886
Go! Quickly!

00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:16.992
<i>Get down here!</i>

00:17:16.993 --> 00:17:18.444
<i>Get down here!</i>

00:17:18.445 --> 00:17:21.008
<i>Are you bullying an old man
like me, since I can't climb a tree?</i>

00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:22.760
<i>Listen!</i>

00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:24.770
Get down here now!

00:17:24.771 --> 00:17:27.104
I must beat you to death today!

00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:29.778
Who are you to attend
the sacrificial ritual?

00:17:29.779 --> 00:17:32.891
Apart from stirring up trouble,
you even got someone else involved.

00:17:33.451 --> 00:17:34.857
Are you coming down or not?

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:35.957
Are you coming down?

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:39.756
I really want to come down
but I'm scared of heights.

00:17:39.757 --> 00:17:40.976
This child...

00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:42.276
Uncle Zhou, don't get angry!

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:44.405
Fu Yao, just admit
your mistake to Uncle Zhou!

00:17:44.406 --> 00:17:46.600
If you have her interests
at heart, don't hold me back

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:47.931
or I'll hit you too! I'll...

00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:49.250
Don't! Don't hit him!

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.852
I forced him to go with me.

00:17:50.853 --> 00:17:52.362
No, Fu Yao didn't.

00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:53.481
I wanted to go there.

00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:55.122
Whether or not you went there voluntarily

00:17:55.123 --> 00:17:56.671
get back to the dye house!

00:17:56.672 --> 00:17:57.999
- All right!
- Get going!

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.403
Go. Go now!

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.639
Uncle Zhou...

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.287
Look, he's gone.

00:18:06.288 --> 00:18:08.067
Stop scolding me.

00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:10.636
Besides, all I did was take a look.

00:18:10.637 --> 00:18:12.087
No one spotted me.

00:18:14.074 --> 00:18:15.155
Get down here.

00:18:16.799 --> 00:18:18.150
Come down. I won't hit you.

00:18:22.397 --> 00:18:24.425
If you come down,
I'll assign you a nice chore.

00:18:24.426 --> 00:18:25.527
Oh.

00:18:26.027 --> 00:18:27.538
It's the 15th of this month.

00:18:29.537 --> 00:18:31.436
Head down the mountain
and bring some wine back.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.952
You'd let me leave the mountain?

00:18:33.953 --> 00:18:36.337
Fine. If you won't go,
I'll ask someone else.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.719
You... so you finally came down.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.298
Where do you think you're going?

00:18:42.299 --> 00:18:43.861
Aren't you quite a tree climber?

00:18:43.862 --> 00:18:46.038
It hurts!

00:18:48.333 --> 00:18:50.479
Stop hitting me. My bottom hurts.

00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:53.481
Get up!

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.285
Let me have a look.

00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:05.518
If I could beat some
sense into you, I really would!

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.567
It hurts.

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:12.374
Fu Yao, be honest with me.

00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:14.825
What's so bad about the Xuanyou Division?

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:18.860
Yes, we're of a lowly-rank.

00:19:18.861 --> 00:19:20.396
We live in poverty.

00:19:20.397 --> 00:19:23.354
But everyone in our division
treats you very well.

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:25.953
Seven and the other children
are always following you around.

00:19:25.954 --> 00:19:27.153
What have you taught them?

00:19:27.154 --> 00:19:28.803
To climb trees like you do?

00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:31.439
Are you always racking your brain
for ways to get out of the black gown?

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.509
What's wrong?

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.797
I get along with everyone
in Xuanyou Division.

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:36.654
I'm also quite close to White.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.317
You should behave then.

00:19:38.318 --> 00:19:39.800
How have I misbehaved?

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.893
I just find this unfair.

00:19:41.894 --> 00:19:44.097
Why must people be ranked?

00:19:44.098 --> 00:19:45.818
Look at those in the Xuanzheng Division.

00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.122
They get to train in martial arts
when they come here.

00:19:48.123 --> 00:19:49.468
They can go anywhere they please.

00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:50.822
They even bully us.

00:19:50.823 --> 00:19:52.122
We even have to attend to them.

00:19:52.123 --> 00:19:54.022
Why? Are we so lowly
that we have to do that?

00:19:55.192 --> 00:19:56.625
Not another word.

00:19:56.626 --> 00:19:57.626
This is our fate.

00:19:57.627 --> 00:19:59.973
It's your fate, you have to yield to it.

00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:01.732
I'll be off!

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.546
Don't get into trouble
while you're out and about!

00:20:06.828 --> 00:20:07.987
You hear me?

00:20:07.988 --> 00:20:09.068
I got it!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.198
What have you learned
on this three-month journey?

00:20:13.199 --> 00:20:15.874
I got to meet the legal first
prince at the capital, Kunning.

00:20:15.875 --> 00:20:17.616
He's benevolent, filial, and courageous.

00:20:17.617 --> 00:20:18.862
A splitting image of a sage.

00:20:18.863 --> 00:20:21.021
I'm honored to be held
in high regard by him.

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:23.390
His Highness said that there
are many political factions.

00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:25.355
He wants to form his own army.

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:28.218
And I happen to be
just the person he needs.

00:20:28.219 --> 00:20:30.818
Did you hear any news on your way back?

00:20:31.851 --> 00:20:33.057
What news?

00:20:37.262 --> 00:20:39.135
The situation in Kunning has changed.

00:20:39.136 --> 00:20:40.237
What?

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:57.454
Father.

00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:07.363
Have you made all the
arrangements as I instructed?

00:21:07.364 --> 00:21:09.038
Father...

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:13.098
I ordered Zhang He Nian
to deploy the army into the palace.

00:21:13.099 --> 00:21:16.610
Our troops have the entire city
surrounded from the outside.

00:21:16.611 --> 00:21:18.310
This time, Qi Zhen...

00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:22.220
He won't have any way to escape.

00:21:22.221 --> 00:21:23.640
Good!

00:21:23.641 --> 00:21:25.438
Good...

00:21:25.439 --> 00:21:30.682
Qi Zhen has long coveted my throne.

00:21:30.683 --> 00:21:33.833
Your coronation ceremony
will take place in three days.

00:21:34.673 --> 00:21:36.730
As long as Qi Zhen lives

00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:40.208
the royal Xuanyuan family's
throne will be at risk.

00:21:41.231 --> 00:21:43.329
My son, bear this in mind.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.002
Eradicate him once and for all!

00:21:52.763 --> 00:21:56.064
<i>Eradicate him once and for all!</i>

00:22:30.034 --> 00:22:31.380
Tonight...

00:22:31.381 --> 00:22:34.266
The Taiyuan Kingdom shall be mine!

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.890
Would Qi Zhen
really dare to harm the king?

00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:57.722
He's the Elder Statesman.

00:22:57.723 --> 00:23:00.607
He's the second highest in command.

00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:04.934
Usurping the throne will bring
great chaos to the five kingdoms.

00:23:07.392 --> 00:23:09.593
Since he has held
overwhelming power and authority

00:23:09.594 --> 00:23:13.547
he's bound to go to war
against the royal Xuanyuan family.

00:23:13.548 --> 00:23:17.356
There's no knowing who will make it
through the chaos to victory.

00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:22.358
Once the royal Xuanyuan family
is annihilated and the dynasty changes

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.359
the order in Taiyuan Kingdom
will change as well.

00:23:25.713 --> 00:23:28.713
Will the Xuanyuan Sect
do nothing to help?

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.791
What are we to do?

00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:34.423
Xuanyuan Sect is far out here
in the pugilist world

00:23:34.424 --> 00:23:35.988
and away from political strife.

00:23:35.989 --> 00:23:37.875
We remain neutral and
act only as spectators.

00:23:37.876 --> 00:23:39.400
This is the right path.

00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:42.593
However, I was once held
in high regard by the prince.

00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:44.231
I feel a bit...

00:23:44.232 --> 00:23:46.601
No personal feelings must be
involved in power struggles.

00:23:46.602 --> 00:23:49.226
As long as you come first
in the Warrior Hunt

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:51.944
who wouldn't hold you in high regard

00:23:51.945 --> 00:23:54.776
considering Xuanyuan Sect's
status in the pugilist world

00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:56.691
and your championship
in our internal contest?

00:23:56.692 --> 00:23:59.031
Father, you're right to reprimand me.

00:23:59.032 --> 00:24:00.397
Prepare yourself for the Warrior Hunt.

00:24:00.398 --> 00:24:04.399
You must win the Warrior Hunt.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.607
Yes.

00:24:42.388 --> 00:24:43.407
Your Highness.

00:24:44.979 --> 00:24:46.066
Elder Statesman Qi?

00:24:48.096 --> 00:24:51.041
I've observed the celestial signs
and the stars are dim tonight.

00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:53.992
Blood will be shed in the palace.

00:24:55.436 --> 00:24:57.008
Convey my command.

00:24:57.009 --> 00:25:00.259
Annihilate every member
of the royal Xuanyuan family.

00:25:14.234 --> 00:25:15.788
Lie back down quickly.

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:16.789
Here.

00:25:20.116 --> 00:25:21.456
Don't worry.

00:25:21.457 --> 00:25:23.105
No one will kill you.

00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:26.444
Who would wish to be burdened
with the notoriety of killing the king?

00:25:26.445 --> 00:25:28.533
Just hang in there.

00:25:28.534 --> 00:25:32.534
Then you'll soon be able to see me
take the throne of Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:26:16.391 --> 00:26:17.633
Are you all right?

00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:18.740
Hey!

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.258
Save me!

00:26:21.259 --> 00:26:23.684
I'm the legal first born
of Quan City, Xuanyuan Min.

00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:25.262
Save me! Save me!

00:26:26.284 --> 00:26:27.791
Save me...

00:26:53.329 --> 00:26:55.915
Senior Pei, the net
will tighten over time.

00:26:55.916 --> 00:26:59.081
An ordinary person would
need more then four to six hours

00:26:59.082 --> 00:27:00.259
to tear through or undo it.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.887
As long as we get to teach
Fu Yao a lesson, you'll be rewarded.

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:05.034
Thank you, Senior Pei.

00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:47.257
Hey! Gentlemen!

00:27:47.258 --> 00:27:49.004
Help me!

00:27:49.005 --> 00:27:50.220
Hold on!

00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:51.634
Hey!

00:28:44.961 --> 00:28:46.162
I caught you!

00:28:50.742 --> 00:28:51.958
Junior Pei?

00:28:51.959 --> 00:28:53.535
I'm sorry.

00:28:53.536 --> 00:28:55.515
I thought it was Fu Yao.

00:28:55.516 --> 00:28:57.006
What is it?

00:28:57.007 --> 00:28:59.027
Do I resemble Fu Yao?

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:00.425
No, you don't.

00:29:00.426 --> 00:29:02.227
I just thought that...

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:07.250
Junior Pei, what brings you here?

00:29:08.634 --> 00:29:12.134
Senior Yan, you and Fu Yao
can come here, but I can't?

00:29:13.161 --> 00:29:14.411
That isn't what I meant.

00:29:16.659 --> 00:29:18.520
If so, I'll get going first...

00:29:18.521 --> 00:29:21.482
Senior Yan, it was summer
when you left on your journey.

00:29:21.483 --> 00:29:23.238
Look.

00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:25.424
In the blink of the eye, it's fall.

00:29:25.425 --> 00:29:27.202
It's been three months and nine days.

00:29:27.203 --> 00:29:28.357
Oh, no.

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:31.558
If we count this day,
then it has been 100 days.

00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:34.349
Since my elder sister got married

00:29:34.849 --> 00:29:37.702
my father has hoped to tie
a marital bond with Chancellor's family

00:29:37.703 --> 00:29:39.503
and has urged me
to return to the capital.

00:29:41.842 --> 00:29:43.535
A grown woman should get married.

00:29:43.536 --> 00:29:45.596
You're at the age
to discuss marriage proposals.

00:29:45.597 --> 00:29:47.597
Senior Yan, don't you understand?

00:29:48.818 --> 00:29:51.355
I just wish to remain at Mount Xuanyuan.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.500
I wish to be with you, Senior Yan...

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:58.432
Junior Pei, you've performed
outstandingly in Xuanyuan Sect

00:29:58.433 --> 00:30:01.483
so I believe that you'll do
remarkably well in the Warrior Hunt.

00:30:01.484 --> 00:30:04.163
Then, you'll make a name
for yourself in Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:30:04.164 --> 00:30:05.459
Not to mention
in front of the Chancellor.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:09.259
Even the royal family
would ask for your hand.

00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:12.671
It's true that I don't wish
to return to the capital

00:30:12.672 --> 00:30:14.854
because I want to participate
in the Warrior Hunt.

00:30:14.855 --> 00:30:16.518
But I'm not just
doing so for my own sake.

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:17.969
It's for your sake.

00:30:19.344 --> 00:30:23.144
I'd like to make you famous
throughout Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:30:26.186 --> 00:30:28.015
Who placed the net here? Let me go!

00:30:28.016 --> 00:30:29.076
Let me down!

00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:30.970
Which jerk did this?

00:30:30.971 --> 00:30:33.076
Why is it the same trick again?

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:36.442
Who did this?

00:30:40.989 --> 00:30:44.497
Senior Yan, my feelings...

00:30:44.498 --> 00:30:45.893
<i>Help!</i>

00:30:45.894 --> 00:30:48.294
<i>Help me!</i>

00:30:48.295 --> 00:30:50.635
<i>Help!</i>

00:30:50.636 --> 00:30:51.724
It's Fu Yao!

00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:23.334
Did you verify his identity?

00:31:23.335 --> 00:31:25.984
He's indeed the legal first born
son of Quan City, Xuanyuan Min.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.694
Kill him.

00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:37.332
Master Yun Hen, the Elder Statesman
gave orders to keep him alive.

00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.532
Hold on.

00:31:39.688 --> 00:31:41.337
Luckily, he just passed out.

00:31:44.284 --> 00:31:45.685
Help!

00:31:46.775 --> 00:31:47.972
Help!

00:31:49.604 --> 00:31:50.912
Fu Yao!

00:31:52.859 --> 00:31:54.280
Senior Yan!

00:31:55.494 --> 00:31:56.560
Senior Yan!

00:32:03.272 --> 00:32:04.506
Well?

00:32:04.507 --> 00:32:05.902
Are you all right?

00:32:05.903 --> 00:32:07.278
I'm fine.

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:09.746
Didn't you leave the mountain
to bring back the rice wine?

00:32:09.747 --> 00:32:11.284
How did you end up like this?

00:32:11.285 --> 00:32:12.564
Are you hurt?

00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:13.902
The rice wine...

00:32:13.903 --> 00:32:16.556
Oh no... I'm done for!

00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:20.303
- I'm doomed!
- What's wrong, Fu Yao?

00:32:20.304 --> 00:32:21.444
I'm doomed.

00:32:25.252 --> 00:32:26.399
This is bad.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.309
Uncle Zhou will surely beat me to death.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.433
Look at you.

00:32:29.434 --> 00:32:31.414
You're always so careless.

00:32:31.415 --> 00:32:32.449
Forget it.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:33.976
I'll explain it to Uncle Zhou later.

00:32:36.028 --> 00:32:37.251
What are you looking for?

00:32:37.252 --> 00:32:38.278
What's wrong?

00:32:38.851 --> 00:32:40.036
What are you trying to find?

00:32:42.808 --> 00:32:47.456
Senior Yan, did you see
an injured man on your way here?

00:32:47.457 --> 00:32:51.207
Is this the time to worry
about someone else?

00:32:52.588 --> 00:32:53.704
Whatever.

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.905
I hope that he's all right.

00:32:58.634 --> 00:33:00.057
Look at you.

00:33:00.058 --> 00:33:03.643
You're injured and you're still
worrying about someone else.

00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:09.129
Fu Yao, you're a girl.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.289
A girl should behave like one.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.980
You should cry and feel aggrieved.

00:33:13.981 --> 00:33:16.020
You should make others
feel upset for you.

00:33:16.727 --> 00:33:17.852
Senior Yan...

00:33:17.853 --> 00:33:19.756
Are you worried about me?

00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:22.990
Silly girl.

00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:25.962
Take a seat over there
so I can look at your wounds.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.095
Look, it's bleeding.

00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:44.949
I know it's because I'm kind
to you and treat you differently...

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.450
Some people are always out to bully you.

00:33:49.487 --> 00:33:52.886
Someone must have pulled
a prank on you today.

00:33:54.097 --> 00:33:56.627
I know just how aggrieved you must be.

00:33:57.305 --> 00:33:59.007
I don't feel aggrieved.

00:34:00.299 --> 00:34:02.786
Whoever bullies me,
I'll just get back at them.

00:34:02.787 --> 00:34:05.094
You're too competitive.

00:34:05.095 --> 00:34:08.094
Don't you know that it does you
harm to be overly unyielding?

00:34:09.998 --> 00:34:11.477
Fu Yao, don't you worry.

00:34:11.478 --> 00:34:14.156
When I become the next
Chief of Xuanyuan Sect

00:34:14.157 --> 00:34:17.157
I'll make sure that
you're no longer a servant.

00:34:18.112 --> 00:34:23.695
Then, I'll make it known
to everyone that you're mine.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.514
Now that I've heard you say that...

00:34:37.867 --> 00:34:40.467
I won't feel aggrieved anymore,
even if I'm treated unfairly.

00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:47.011
But if you could treat
the disciples of Xuanyou Division

00:34:47.012 --> 00:34:52.216
as kindly as you treat me and
rid them of their black gowns soon

00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:53.643
wouldn't that be great?

00:34:54.876 --> 00:34:57.181
There are the regulations
of Mount Xuanyuan to abide by.

00:34:59.753 --> 00:35:00.928
All right now.

00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:02.549
Why are we talking about this?

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.182
I'll escort you back.

00:35:05.454 --> 00:35:06.489
Let's go.

00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:08.858
Let's go.

00:35:11.858 --> 00:35:13.742
Someone has trespassed into the mountain.

00:35:20.307 --> 00:35:22.051
Someone has trespassed into the mountain?

00:35:22.052 --> 00:35:24.274
Who could be so bold?

00:35:24.275 --> 00:35:26.682
He claimed to be the
Elder Statesman, Qi Zhen's subordinate.

00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:35.620
Xuanyuan Sect is a potent
force of Taiyuan Kingdom

00:35:35.621 --> 00:35:37.346
and tops all the sects
in the five kingdoms.

00:35:37.347 --> 00:35:40.747
Who are you
to barge in here as you please?

00:35:40.748 --> 00:35:42.195
<i>The Chief has arrived!</i>

00:35:51.974 --> 00:35:54.761
I'm Yan Lie, Chief of Xuanyuan Sect.

00:35:54.762 --> 00:35:57.437
I wonder what made you
trespass into my grounds.

00:35:57.438 --> 00:36:00.446
Do you have at least
a few competent doctors?

00:36:00.447 --> 00:36:02.500
Someone is injured.

00:36:02.501 --> 00:36:06.216
Master Qi Zhen of Taiyuan Kingdom
asked to have him rescued.

00:36:06.217 --> 00:36:08.317
You must have been
in the capital for too long.

00:36:08.318 --> 00:36:11.796
You've forgotten how you should
behave when asking for help.

00:36:11.797 --> 00:36:13.701
<i>The Elder Statesman has arrived!</i>

00:36:57.137 --> 00:36:59.845
Can that doctor
manage to save him or not?

00:36:59.846 --> 00:37:02.158
Elder Statesman, fret not.

00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:05.924
<i>That's the famous doctor
of the pugilist world.</i>

00:37:05.925 --> 00:37:07.675
<i>Divine Physician, Zong Yue.</i>

00:37:09.115 --> 00:37:12.747
<i>Doctor Zong only comes up the mountain
in the fall to gather medicinal herbs.</i>

00:37:12.748 --> 00:37:14.914
<i>Otherwise, it would be hard
to track his whereabouts.</i>

00:37:17.697 --> 00:37:20.963
Anyone he treats is
sure to recover fully.

00:37:22.789 --> 00:37:24.362
The Divine Physician?

00:37:25.172 --> 00:37:28.672
Let's hope he lives up to his reputation.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.743
Has the patient recovered?

00:37:38.744 --> 00:37:40.379
He is fine.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.795
He will surely regain
consciousness within an hour.

00:37:44.302 --> 00:37:47.165
Doctor, please write him a prescription.

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.118
I've already told you.

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:50.785
He is just fine.

00:37:50.786 --> 00:37:52.073
No medication is needed.

00:37:52.074 --> 00:37:53.478
I'll take my leave.

00:37:55.907 --> 00:37:57.153
How impudent.

00:37:59.394 --> 00:38:01.213
Forget it.

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:06.506
Since he's just a commoner

00:38:06.507 --> 00:38:09.314
it's inevitable that he
carries an air of arrogance

00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:10.804
and defiance against nobility.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:34.336
<i>He's indeed the legal first born
son of Quan City, Xuanyuan Min.</i>

00:38:43.043 --> 00:38:44.139
Father...

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.354
Father, what exactly is this about?

00:38:48.355 --> 00:38:49.852
Convey my orders.

00:38:49.853 --> 00:38:51.744
Attend to the guests carefully.

00:38:52.744 --> 00:38:54.094
Who exactly is in there?

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.368
It's the Elder Statesman
of Taiyuan Kingdom, Qi Zhen.

00:38:59.369 --> 00:39:00.669
What?

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.506
I'm afraid that there must've been
unforeseen changes in the palace

00:39:03.507 --> 00:39:06.172
if Qi Zhen is visiting
Mount Xuanyuan now.

00:39:06.173 --> 00:39:10.010
But this will serve as
an opportunity for you.

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240
You...

00:39:41.193 --> 00:39:42.483
Who are you?

00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:45.934
What... what is this place?

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.981
Are you really Xuanyuan Min,
the legal first born son of Quan City?

00:40:08.235 --> 00:40:10.623
So what if I am?

00:40:15.152 --> 00:40:16.385
So what if I'm not?

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:51.112
The royal Xuanyuan family is indeed
skilled in the art of manipulating water.

00:40:51.847 --> 00:40:53.179
Who exactly are you?

00:40:55.376 --> 00:40:57.204
How could you know of this secret?

00:41:02.757 --> 00:41:05.462
Official Qi Zhen greets Your Highness.

00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:08.840
Your Highness,
please forgive me for alarming you.

00:41:14.036 --> 00:41:16.300
Your... Your Highness?

00:41:21.514 --> 00:41:23.349
Who are you addressing as Your Highness?

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:28.984
It seems that the king's decree
has yet to reach Quan City.

00:41:28.985 --> 00:41:34.354
Your Highness, the king has conferred you
as the legal heir of the Taiyuan Kingdom.

00:41:34.355 --> 00:41:37.255
The procession to escort you
to the palace will arrive in two days.

00:41:49.795 --> 00:41:51.042
Is this true?

00:41:51.043 --> 00:41:52.516
Your Highness.

00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:54.951
What do you think?

00:42:00.824 --> 00:42:02.278
This means...

00:42:03.768 --> 00:42:05.480
I...

00:42:10.434 --> 00:42:12.483
I'll become the next king
of the Taiyuan Kingdom?

00:42:15.472 --> 00:42:17.208
Yes.

00:42:24.273 --> 00:42:25.607
Good.

00:42:25.608 --> 00:42:27.262
Sure...

00:42:31.831 --> 00:42:33.581
I'll be the king.

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:41.472
