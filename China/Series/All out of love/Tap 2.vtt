<i>[Episode 2]</i>

20
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.690
I haven't done anything yet.

21
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.890
Which kind of dog bit you?

22
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490
Who says it's a dog? I was bitten by a human!

23
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.130
Your little sister is fine. But if any of these symptoms develop,

24
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.840
- quickly come back here.  
 - Okay. 
 - Don't forget.

25
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.610
Remember. Also, there's this medicine; the instructions are written here.

26
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.240
- Okay, remember this. 
- Okay, thank you.

27
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.800
Older Brother.

28
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.420
Jiang Sheng.

29
00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.270
Why did you wake up? Did it suddenly hurt? Do you feel nauseous?

30
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.020
It doesn't hurt anymore.

31
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.790
No way. The gash was so deep.

32
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.390
It really doesn't hurt.

33
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.130
Jiang Sheng, listen to me.

34
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.100
If you have a headache, or suddenly want to throw up, tell me.

35
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.650
I'll take you to the hospital. This is nothing to joke about.

36
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.090
I have received the best medicine. I promise I'm okay now.

37
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.220
What medicine did you get?

38
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.490
Your care. With that, I won't get a headache or feel nauseous.

39
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.940
Tell me.

40
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.640
A girl's face shouldn't have any scars. You wouldn't look good anymore.

41
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.370
There's nothing wrong with having a scar. If we lose each other one day,

42
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.450
you can search for me with my scar. With that, you'll know it's me.

43
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.210
Jiang Sheng.

44
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.630
We must never be separated.

45
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.320
- Does it still hurt? 
- I'm okay.

46
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.770
Brother, this scar proves that I'm brave. I'm not even afraid of Old He.

47
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.250
Don't ever pick a fight with someone like Old He. Next time, don't act so impulsively.

48
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.750
It's fine if I'm bullied. But if anyone bullies you, I'll never let him off.

49
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.490
You've already been hurt once, I don't want to see you hurt a second time.

50
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.350
Wait for me.

51
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.160
- Do you know how to cut hair?
- I... do.

52
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.980
<i>Jiang Sheng! Liangsheng!</i>

53
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.260
Bei Xiaowu.

54
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.500
- The persimmons are ripe. 
 - Great. Hurry and save a few trees for me.

55
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.090
<i>Okay.</i>

56
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:33.120
<i>The persimmons from the trees were treats for the children of Weijiaping.</i>

57
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.660
<i>Perhaps many people would laugh at this.</i>

58
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.140
<i>But at that time, the soil of the land was indeed deficient.</i>

59
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.450
<i>The persimmons were few, but there were a lot of kids.</i>

60
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.870
<i>There was never enough to go around. Often, nasty fights erupted.</i>

61
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.980
If you eat so many, aren't you afraid you'll get diarrhea? Let us through.

62
00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.390
- Why should I let you through? 
 - The trees are everybody's. Why are you keeping them to yourselves?

63
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.130
Keeping it for ourselves? This part of the forest is first come first served.

64
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.120
You guys came late. It's not our fault.

65
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.300
- Bei Xiaowu.
- Bei Xiaowu. Stop.

66
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.030
Who gives you the right to bully others?

67
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.150
So what if I do?

68
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.350
If you want to eat persimmons, all right. Just carve your names into the trees first. Then I won't touch them.

69
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.480
You just aren't skilled enough.

70
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.820
We won't touch the trees with your names on them. If they don't have your name, anyone can pick them.

71
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.780
- Exactly! 
 - Right!

72
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.680
Go carve them!

73
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.410
- No guts! 
 - Right, no guts.

74
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.810
Call your brother to come and eat.

75
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.130
Mom, it looks like Older Brother didn't come back all night.

76
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.070
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

77
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.480
- Uncle, have you seen Liangsheng? 
 - I haven't seen him.

78
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.670
- You really didn't? 
- I really didn't.

79
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.710
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

80
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.610
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

81
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.020
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

82
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.280
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

83
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.150
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

84
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.640
- Older Brother! 
- Liangsheng!

85
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.100
I will go here and you go there.

86
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.800
Liangsheng!

87
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.210
Older Brother!

88
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.710
<i>If you want to eat persimmons, all right. Just carve your names into the trees first. Then I wont' touch them.</i>

89
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.600
<i>You just aren't skilled enough.</i>

90
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:21.160
<i>We won't touch the trees with your names on them. If they don't have your name, anyone can pick them.</i>

91
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.970
<i>That's right.</i>

92
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.580
<i>From that day on, all the persimmons in Weijiaping belonged to me.</i>

93
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:14.800
<i>That bunch of greedy kids were stunned to see the clear markings on every single tree trunk.</i>

94
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.500
If you wrap my fingers like that, how can I do any chores?

95
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.870
Don't do anything; I'll do it.

96
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.410
These wounds

97
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.590
shouldn't be wrapped like this.

98
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.250
If you have a scar on your hand, it wouldn't look good.

99
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:53.490
Should a boy's hands be slender and pale? Your hands are the most precious to mom.

100
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.170
Then, your hands are the most precious to me.

101
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.530
Your hands can be used to write, calculate,

102
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:09.510
water the ginger lily, and comb my hair. I must take good care of them.

103
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.640
- You sure have lots to say.
 - Of course.

104
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.200
- Does it hurt? 
- No.

105
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.600
Jiang Sheng and Liangsheng, I will take you two to school!

106
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.470
Bei Xiaowu's new bike; high-end, impressive.

107
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.840
It's high grade. It's a reward from my dad.

108
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.010
This bike must be expensive, right?

109
00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.520
Of course!

110
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.270
Let's go to school.

111
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.590
- Mom, we are leaving. 
- Mom, we are leaving.

112
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.980
<i>Hey! Jiang Sheng! Jiang Sheng, I'll give you a ride! Why are you walking when I have a bike?</i>

113
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:14.070
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Never Sad Team @ Viki</i>

114
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.500
- <i>The kids are back.</i>
- Bye-bye!

115
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.600
- Mom, we are back. 
- Dad, we are back.

116
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.400
How was school today?

117
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.460
Jiang Sheng and I studied hard. Don't worry.

118
00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.580
Older Brother, take a look.

119
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.890
A bike? Whose bike is this?

120
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.410
Mom, whose bicycle is this?

121
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.940
I bought this for you two. Liangsheng, try it now.

122
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.170
Okay.

123
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.600
Older Brother, I want to try it, too.

124
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.500
Wait a moment. Let me try it first.

125
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.880
Brother, we have our own bike. This is too great!

126
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.310
- Your foot can reach the ground, right?
- Yes.
- Good.

127
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.140
Thank you, Mom.

128
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.990
Thank you, Mom.

129
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.110
Dad, we have a bicycle.

130
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.130
Great.

131
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.490
In the future, you can ride the bicycle and give a lift to Jiang Sheng to school.

132
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.770
- Okay. 
- Isn't that so, Jiang Sheng?

133
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:10.590
<i>Ahh!</i>

134
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.390
<i>[Weijiaping] 
[Yuhong Middle School]</i>

135
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.150
- So you rode a bike? 
- Yeah, and look at his things!

136
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.790
Let's go!

137
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.870
Jiang Sheng, let's go home.

138
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.970
Mom, are you okay?

139
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.700
I'm fine.

140
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.250
Did He Manhou come bother you again today?

141
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.140
That scoundrel surely has bad intentions.

142
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.900
Mom, I'll help you scoop the rice.

143
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.630
Mom, I don't like to see you so tired.

144
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.730
I don't want you to fall sick.

145
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.510
Jiang Sheng.

146
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.360
Having you and Liangsheng is good enough for me.

147
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.340
I'm content with that.

148
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:31.020
<i>From that time on, I started to do more house and farm chores to help my mom.</i>

149
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.680
<i>I stubbornly thought that if I did more,</i>

150
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.060
<i>she would get fewer gray hairs,</i>

151
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.320
<i>and have better health.</i>

152
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.760
Pour me some water.

153
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.560
Want to drink water, right?

154
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.010
Are you deaf?

155
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.350
Listen to how badly mom is coughing and you still want her to serve you?

156
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.790
If it weren't for you, my mom wouldn't be in this condition.

157
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.110
If it weren't for you and that woman, things would be okay.

158
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.700
It's my pinwheel. It's mine. Give it back!

159
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.920
Jiang Sheng.

160
00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.950
What's wrong?

161
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.210
Did someone bully you? Tell me.

162
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.820
Don't be sad because of Mom.

163
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.330
She'll get better.

164
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.680
She's not your mom. Of course, you wouldn't be sad.

165
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.150
If it weren't for your mom, my mom wouldn't be like this. You know whose son you are.

166
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:06.990
<i>When only sorrow was left for me and Liangsheng,</i>

167
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.190
<i>we realized</i>

169
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.930
<i>we had no other choice.</i>

170
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.990

171

172

173
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.220

Hello. Letters for Jiang Sheng and Jiang Liangsheng.

176
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.820
Please sign here.

177
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.220
- Mom. 
- These are for the both of you.

178
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.600
<i>Outstanding results</i>

179
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.700
<i>allowed us to enter university.</i>

180
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.590
Older Brother, I don't want to attend the school.

181
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.390
I've heard it's a lot of bother to go to university.

182
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.320
There are lots of examinations. It's so troublesome. I don't want to go.

183
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.100
Actually, for a long time, I knew I didn't want to continue with school.

184
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.830
Why go to school? It's better to make money.

185
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.710
How about this? You go to university and I'll financially support you.

186
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.590
Of course not.

187
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.300
If there is Liangsheng, there is Jiang Sheng. If there is Jiang Sheng, there is Liangsheng.

188
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.530
But what about the school fees?

189
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.960
Don't worry. I will apply for student loans.

190
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:54.470
Whenever I become capable, I'll make sure all poor students can go to school.

191
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.960
Mom, are you okay?

192
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.520
Mom, why don't I stay home with you?

193
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.270
I don't want to go to university anymore.

194
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.730
It wasn't easy for you to get into university.

195
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.920
How could you just give up like this?

196
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.550
Older Brother can go to university.

197
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.020
We'll be equally happy if Brother becomes successful.

198
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.590
Jiang Sheng, it has been tough for you these years.

199
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.810
I will help you go to college, no matter the cost.

200
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.020
But if we both leave,

201
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.690
you will be so lonely at home.

202
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.760
Jiang Sheng.

203
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.590
While you are young,

204
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.990
you need to study more.

205
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.340
In the future, become a useful person.

206
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.790
You can't be like me, working as a laborer.

207
00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.880
Leave Weijiaping.

208
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.760
Go and do what you want to do.

232
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.020
We've gotten our student loans. If we add up the money we've earned and cut our living expenses,

233
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:35.620
we'll have enough for our travel and miscellaneous expenses.

234
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.300
Brother, thanks for your hard work. You worked part-time jobs from morning to night.

235
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:45.510
You talk as if you were lazing around. You helped mom a lot during the vacation. You even did my share.

236
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:48.290
I had it easy compared to you.

237
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:54.400
Brother, trust me. I will surely get scholarships in university.

238
00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.230
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

239
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.020
Older Brother.

240
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.460
You really want to take it with you?

241
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.330
Yes. I'm used to having the ginger lily with me.

242
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:15.330
All right. Then let us three all go to university.

243
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.100
Wait a minute.

244
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.190
- Why is he here?
- I don't know either.

245
00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.420
What did you two say earlier?

246
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.220
We said we're going to college; none of your business.

247
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.250
None of my business? You guys are doing what the Cantonese call

248
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.040
"joking around."

249
00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.960
- What does that mean?
 - What does that mean?

250
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:49.130
You two leave when you like; leaving me nothing but a gust of wind. You guys are really savage.

251
00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:53.570
How can this be tolerated? I'm not happy.

252
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.780
Starting from today,

253
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:00.900
I'm sticking to you two. I'm going to the same university as you.

254
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.950
You stalker! As if you could get into university.

255
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:08.890
Don't look down on me!

256
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.340
You two, stop arguing. How about you go home and arrange your luggage?

257
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.380
You guys need to focus on packing, too. My dad arranged for a car to pick you up tomorrow.

258
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.680
- We don't need it.
- You don't need it?

259
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.810
I'm afraid you'll get addicted to riding in a car.

260
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.820
Don't you want to go to college? Go home now.

261
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:33.590
I'm telling you. This is just the beginning. In the next four years of college,

262
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:37.670
I'm going to flaunt my excellent grades at you.

263
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.550
You! Are you leaving or not?

264
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.600
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

265
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.250
Okay then. The four of us will go to university.

266
00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.480
Liangsheng.

267
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.970
I never would've thought.

268
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.310
You are going to university soon.

269
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:15.790
Dad, don't be sad. Don't worry. I will come home during the term breaks.

270
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.930
I'm not sad.

271
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.830
I just feel emotional.

272
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.440
Liangsheng.

273
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.850
Once you get to the city, it will just be you and your sister.

274
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.390
Take good care of her.

275
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.600
Frankly speaking,

276
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.200
all these years,

277
00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.030
I favored you and neglected your sister.

278
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.050
Once you get to the city,

279
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.130
it'll be hard for you to come back.

280
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:58.110
Dad, don't worry. I will take good care of her.

281
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.100
I won't let her suffer at all. As long as I'm around, Jiang Sheng is home.

282
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:19.820
Take this and eat on the road. Don't starve.

283
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.930
Don't worry, Mom. We'll take care of ourselves.

284
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:28.250
Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of Jiang Sheng.

285
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.950
Liangsheng, when you are out there, don't make it hard on yourself.

286
00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.610
There's no rush, Auntie. Take your time to chat.

287
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.620
I need to learn from you guys. Next time, my dad and I will do the same thing.

288
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.670
He's full of nonsense. You guys chat. Let's go. Stay in the car.

289
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.080
<i>Don't worry.</i>

290
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:52.130
<i>Why are you filled with so much nonsense?</i>

291
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.940
Dad.

292
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.090
Take care of yourself.

293
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.240
Mom, we are leaving.

294
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.910
We're leaving, Mom.

295
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.110
<i>We are leaving. Bye-bye.</i>

296
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.860
I have not let your mother down.

297
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.990
I also have not

298
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.430
let your biological father down.

299
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.210
You three have all been accepted into college.

300
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:01.850
You should both play around and study. Don't waste your youth.

301
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:05.050
Yes, I'll be in charge of playing.

302
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:08.140
If you fool around, I'll cut your resources.

303
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.530
- I'll play less. I'll play less.
- Uncle Bei, don't worry. I'll watch him for you.

304
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.800
Watch over him.

305
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.860
Look! Look!

306
00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:29.950
<i>And so our college careers began with bared fangs and brandished claws.</i>

307
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:35.210
<i>But I was very happy because no one would glare at Liangsheng again,</i>

308
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.140
<i>and no one would call him an illegitimate child.</i>

309
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.780
Son, I'm going to pay for you guys. Wait a while for me.

310
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.450
I'm going, too.

311
00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.600
Give me the money.

312
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.160
Dad, help them pay as well. We're going to take a walk.

313
00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.930
Go. Go walk around.

314
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.830
- Thank you, Uncle.
- Let's go.

315
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.970
- You live here, too?
- Yeah. Hi. I'll be living in this room, too.

316
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.360
Hi. I'm Jin Ling.

317
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.420
My name is Jiang Sheng. "Jiang" as in ginger, and "Sheng" as in to grow.

318
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.620
My name refers to Nanjing, the ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, also known as Jin Ling.

319
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.560
Which bed are you taking?

320
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:35.980
- I will take this. 
- Okay.

321
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.060
Quickly unpack then.

322
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.080
Jin Ling, here.

323
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.060
This is an egg my mom brought for me from home.

324
00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.380
Thank you.

325
00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.960
Take it.

326
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.230
Be serious in your studies. I'm going back.

327
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.490
All right, Dad. Whenever I'm free, I'll think about you.

328
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.730
Just focus on your studies.

329
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.900
- Uncle Bei, bye. 
- Go back now.

330
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:21.300
<i>Wow, Tianyou. Your skills have reached its peak. You're even refurbishing vintage cars.</i>

331
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.120
You must have something serious to discuss.

332
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.280
Otherwise, you wouldn't dare to come bother me.

333
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.680
Er... it's like this.

334
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.890
There's progress on what you had me investigate. So what's the next step?

335
00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.160
Let's go. We're flying back to China.

336
00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.700
Grandma.

337
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.650
Aiyo! Tianyou.

338
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.480
- You are back, dear.
- I'm back.

339
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.890
My sweetheart.

340
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.980
You have lost weight.

341
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.560
Why did you climb so high up?

342
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.000
I... that...

343
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.470
All of these are from when I was little.

344
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.100
Behind my dad and grandfather's back,

345
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.180
you used them to tease and play with me.

346
00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.970
That's right.

347
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.360
Back then, your grandfather didn't let you play.

348
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.700
They even wanted to dismiss me; they even threatened me.

349
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.960
You were a kid. If you don't let children play,

350
00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.620
would they still be children?

351
00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:01.320
I put this stuff on top of that closet and haven't touched them in a long time.

352
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.540
I wanted to tidy them.

353
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.380
To my surprise, you came back.

354
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.480
You haven't touched them in a long time?

355
00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.560
There's no dust.

356
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.910
Okay, don't place this box too high next time. It's too dangerous.

357
00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:22.700
Aiyo. As time sneaks by,

358
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.760
I need to accept my old age.

359
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.000
You're not old.

360
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.040
Have you seen your grandfather?

361
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.400
Not yet. When I got off the plane, I wanted to come see you first.

362
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.140
I'm doing fine.

363
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.720
Go home now.

364
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.830
Tianyou, look at that smile.

365
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:47.190
Are you scheming something again for your grandfather?

366
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.200
What is it again now?

367
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.150
No, no, it's nothing.

368
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.530
Grandfather.

369
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:07.300
I can't believe that you can cook now.

370
00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.380
I've been out of the country for over ten years, but I didn't learn any of these elegant leisure activities.

371
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:15.280
I asked the cook at Jiangnan Kitchen to make it.

372
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:20.670
However, they're all to your and Tianen's tastes. I hope I remembered correctly.

373
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.580
Since you had nothing else to do, why didn't you personally cook?

374
00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.180
I visited Grandma.

375
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:31.020
Oh? It's true you haven't seen her in a while.

376
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.310
You can have old ties, but you shouldn't let them become hindrances.

377
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.900
Okay, we won't talk about those irrelevant things. Let's begin eating.

378
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.790
We're not waiting for Tianen?

379
00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.790
How long will you be staying for this time?

380
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.020
I don't plan to leave.

381
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.220
That's good, too.

382
00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.360
Is the cinema... your homecoming project?

383
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:09.630
It's not a cinema;  I plan to make a chain of cinemas.

384
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.080
It would complement our company's expansion into film culture.

385
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.290
I want to transform the company into a dumbbell structure.

386
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.590
Dumbbell?

387
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.450
Real Estate, Culture, Finance, Recreation.

388
00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.250
As a corporation, we would command both ends of the weight.

389
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.330
Both ends of the weight will be used to transport content of excellent quality.

390
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.680
And these weights will allow the corporation to be

391
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.210
stable, continuously expanding.

392
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.890
This will result in a complete up and down ecology chain.

393
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.290
This plan is not bad but let me advise you:

394
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:50.300
Shang Yang's plan wasn't bad either. 
<i>(reformer of the State of Qin during the Warring States period)</i>

395
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.570
But what happened in the end?

396
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:54.960
I don't plan to convince them over to my side.

397
00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:02.000
I previously established a company in tech innovation.

398
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.940
I'll make further actions once I've completed my tasks at hand.

399
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.680
You'll be standing on the sidelines?

400
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.250
This is your own family.

401
00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.040
I remember.

402
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.800
Now that you're back in the country,

403
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.690
it's time to focus.

404
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.430
The Cheng family line depends on you now.

405
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.190
I'll use this opportunity to arrange some people for you to meet.

406
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.190
The daughter of Wandao Group's President Chen just returned from Switzerland.

407
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:39.050
Arrange a day to meet with her.

408
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:41.420
Grandfather, regarding this...

409
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.920
I'm not interested in it.

410
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.980
How long are you going to make me wait?

411
00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.320
Grandpa, I wish you a long life.

412
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:57.950
You...

413
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:02.690
I can't eat too much during the evening.

414
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.660
Take your time to eat.

415
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.810
Don't eat everything in one bite.

416
00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.100
Remember. Eat slowly and savor the taste.

417
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.460
When I was younger,

418
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.100
I always wondered when I'd be able to go to college.

419
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.220
I always thought that I'd never grow up.

420
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.980
I never thought

421
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.660
now that I'm in college,

422
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:37.920
it feels fake.

423
00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.950
What fake?

424
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:44.260
I remember in third year of high school, you said you really wanted to go to college.

425
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.240
You thought college wouldn't be that stressful and would give you more freedom. Now that you're here,

426
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.920
why do you feel that it's fake?

427
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.310
Back then, I just wanted to come out to see it.

428
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.960
You just got here. You're just not used to it yet.

429
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.300
You'll be fine after some time.

430
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.230
Mom definitely misses me.

431
00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.320
Uncle Bei really made a mistake this time.

432
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.320
He should have let you live inside the university. If not, who will control you?

433
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.450
A clever hare has more than one hideout.

434
00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:17.750
If I don't set up this place, where will you two stay when you escape the curfew?

435
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.400
Jiang Sheng and I are here to learn. We won't run away.

436
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.770
That's right. Brother and I are the same. I'm here to learn, too. I'm not running away either.

437
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.420
You're wasting away your time in college.

438
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.520
What do you know?

439
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.240
Isn't a student's main responsibility to study? What else is there?

440
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.330
That's right.

441
00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.220
Xiaowu, return this money to Uncle Bei.

442
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.900
What? This is for you. Why give it back?

443
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.860
Just help me thank Uncle Bei.

444
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.040
Thanks.

445
00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.400
But... even if you give this to me, I wouldn't be able to return this. He went to Hebei for business.

446
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.270
I won't be able to see him for a long time, either.

447
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.890
Hebei? He went to Hebei?

448
00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.100
That's quite far from home.

449
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.050
It is far. It's to the north of Henan.

450
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.690
Auntie, please wait.

451
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.530
Hello, Mom. We have already arrived at the university.

452
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.160
Yes, we are safe and sound.

453
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:18.190
Okay. Liangsheng, someone came today to install a phone in our home.

454
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.960
In the future, you don't need to go through Auntie Bei to call home.

455
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.870
Someone installed a phone at our home? It will be convenient for us to call you then.

456
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.820
That's right. Where is Jiang Sheng?

457
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.550
She's here.

458
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.860
Hello, Mom. You finally have a phone at home now?

459
00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.690
We will call you often then.

460
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.990
Okay. Jiang Sheng, you must be serious in your studies.

461
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.700
Don't worry about the financial matters. Your dad and I will think of a way.

462
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.820
<i>You must listen to your Older Brother. Understand?</i>

463
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.720
I know.

464
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.040
Oh, right. I put a small, cloth bag in your luggage.

465
00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.020
Small, cloth bag?

466
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.430
<i>Yes. I placed it in your suitcase.</i>

467
00:40:55.430 --> 00:41:00.070
<i>Look out for it later. The items inside are for you and Liangsheng.</i>

468
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.670
<i>Okay, rest early.</i>

469
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.590
Okay then. Goodnight, Mom.

470
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.570
Goodnight, Mom.

471
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.550
What's the cloth bag?

472
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.650
I don't know either.

473
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:23.300
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Never Sad Team @ Viki</i>

474
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:49.330
This money is all from Mom?

475
00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.530
Mom must've worked hard for this money.

476
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:57.520
Brother, why does college cost so much?

477
00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.760
My heart hurts for Mom.

478
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.720
Don't worry too much.

479
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.540
I already gave the Household Center a call. I'm thinking of becoming a private tutor.

480
00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.490
You should just focus on studying.

481
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.960
In the future, allow Dad and Mom to live comfortably.

482
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.290
I want to be a private tutor, too. I want to split the responsibility with you.

483
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.800
You aren't allowed to work.

484
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.930
Why?

485
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:20.290
I want you to enjoy the experience of university life

486
00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:26.250
and study hard. In the future, be a contributor to society and help others.

487
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.090
All right. I'll remember your words.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.730
♫ <i>I burn myself to create a warm world</i> ♫

504
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.500
♫ <i>I hear your wishes and help you fulfill them</i> ♫

505
00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.300
♫ <i>In the circle of life, my true love never dies</i> ♫

506
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.380
♫ <i>I'm the blue sky that drives away cloud and mist</i> ♫

507
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.550
♫ <i>To leave you a clear sky, and that devours blizzards</i> ♫

508
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.670
♫ <i>And sweeps up leaves so that you can smell the flowers</i> ♫

509
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:39.270
♫ <i>The circle of life is longer than eternity</i> ♫
