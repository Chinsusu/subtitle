<i>[Episode 3]</i>

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
First, everyone focus your attention.

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.310
Secondly, pay attention to your appearance and bearing.

22
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.390
Allow both of your hands to naturally hang.

23
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.470
Don't clench your fists.

24
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.920
Please look at what I am doing now.

25
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.470
Look to the right! Very good.

26
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.110
Two, three.

27
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.620
Okay, listen to my command now. Marching forward.

28
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.310
Very good.

29
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.160
Try to keep your balance, and don't laugh.

30
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.760
Wow, it's so hot.

31
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.530
I'm going to faint from the heat soon.

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.180
How are you feeling? Hot?

33
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.700
Weiyang! Weiyang!

34
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.480
Come help! Weiyang!

35
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.270
- Weiyang! Hurry!
- Is she okay?

36
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.220
Careful. Slowly.

37
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.870
She's alright. It's a heat stroke. She'll be fine after drinking more water and resting well.

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.330
I'm glad she's alright. Thank you.

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.160
- Take care of her, then.
- Okay.

40
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.760
Rest well. I'll go off now.

41
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.130
Thank you.

42
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.040
It's okay.

43
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.440
Brother. You two eat this. I won't eat it. I might gain weight.

44
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.630
Enough, enough, you eat.

45
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.430
Enough.

46
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.460
You go over there first. I'll join you in a while.

47
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.490
Okay.

48
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.490
Classmate.

49
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.380
How are you?

50
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.810
Thank you for your help that day.

51
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.520
I bought an extra bottle. This is for you.

52
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.260
My friends are waiting for me. I'll go off now.

53
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.590
Who is that girl?

54
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.360
She is quite pretty.

55
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.110
When you see them next time, buy two more bottles.

56
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.480
Then we'll all have one each!

57
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.630
Eat your food.

58
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.380
The grass fields in Weijiaping are better. Even the crickets there are louder than the ones here.

59
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.910
I really don't understand you.

60
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.200
When you were in Weijiajing, you wanted to leave.

61
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.160
Now that you are here  you keep lamenting that Weijiaping is better.

62
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.680
You don't know anything! This is being homesick!

63
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.870
What do you know! You are heartless!

64
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.960
My brother and I are full of emotions. Only we can understand what is like to be homesick.

65
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.700
Emotions are all you have left.

66
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.840
Besides emotions, you have nothing else.

67
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.110
What do you mean?

68
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.680
Look at you! What else do you have except physical strength?

69
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.120
Let's take a look at this.

70
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.110
Scholarship.

71
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.140
When my brother was in high school, he was awarded a national level scholarship.

72
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.400
The two of you are so good in school. You must have suffered a great deal of hardship.

73
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.920
I don't find it hard.

74
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.530
Rather, I find joy in it.

75
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.180
Look at this.

76
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.040
The criterion for this scholarship is good entrance exam results.

77
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.160
I think this one has the highest possibility. I will apply for this one.

78
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.510
Okay. You won't have any problem with it.

79
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.320
Look. Jiang Liangsheng.

80
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.050
He's so handsome.

81
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:50.120
Let me tell you. Those who habitually sit in the corner usually do not like to mix with others.

82
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.330
They feel very insecure in their hearts.

83
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.860
It's difficult to get along with people like them.

84
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.310
- Is that so?
- What a pity!

85
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.600
Today, we are going to discuss economics.

86
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.690
What is economics?

87
00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.990
Its main purpose is the efficient distribution of resources

88
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.690
and optimized regeneration. Maximized production

89
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.030
is created from limited values.

90
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.710
What is hardest here is how to

91
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.330
reasonably distribute abundant resources

92
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.590
and scarce resources.

93
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.620
School has just started. I'm not sure how much you understand about economics.

94
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.580
Is there anyone who can tell me

95
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.800
what the Principle of Ockham's Razor refers to?

96
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.950
This teacher is expecting too much. The textbooks are still new. Who would know?

97
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.150
Can you answer my question?

98
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.510
I'm just testing the class.

99
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.120
The Principle of Ockham's Razor is also known as the Law of Ockham's Razor.

100
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.510
The main idea is to use the simplest solutions to solve problems.

101
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.750
Using the least resources to achieve the best outcome.

102
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.960
- If we apply this principle to love...  
- He's so smart!

103
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.520
I think then, the purer the love, the more beautiful it will be.

104
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.760
This is what is generally known as pure love.

105
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.950
- Very good. Please sit down. 
- He's so handsome and smart!

106
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.270
This student has given a very good answer. It looks like the class's foundation is strong.

107
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.240
Next, we will move on to

108
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.250
the survey report. You can choose your own topics.

109
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.430
I will group you according to your class registration number.

110
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.240
Two in each group. I hope that you will help each other in your work here.

111
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.370
The grades of your reports

112
00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.410
will affect your end of term results directly.

113
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:03.090
You're in the same group as Jiang Liangsheng, right?

114
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.720
My partner is an idiot.

115
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.920
You two will have a great time. The campus belle and the handsomest boy in the university!

116
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.060
If the two of you do not get first, we would have given you this honour in vain!

117
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.830
Jiang Liangsheng!

118
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.880
What?

119
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.370
Hello, I'm Ning Weiyang.

120
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.960
Hello, I'm Liangsheng.

121
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.620
I'm very happy to be your partner.

122
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.400
Do you want to eat together later?

123
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.380
Liangsheng!

124
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.390
Wait a moment. No, it's okay, I have something else on. I'll leave now.

125
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.070
Brother, look at our shadows. Don't they look like fatties?

126
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.890
Are you hungry?

127
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.430
What are you eating?

128
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.530
I'm eating the plain noodles that you make for me, brother.

129
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.640
Are you missing home?

130
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.780
No, I think I just miss

131
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.960
our childhood times together.

132
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.720
Are you stupid? I'm right next to you. What's there to miss?

133
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.190
True!

134
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.200
You've already broke four times today.

135
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.780
Are you okay?

136
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.540
I'm fine. The screw is loose.

137
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.020
<i>[Magic, Home of Motorcycles]</i>

138
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.420
Let me do it.

139
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.010
Done.

140
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.960
<i>[Magic, Home of Motorcycles]</i>

141
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.180
<i>Come and look at this. See if it's leaking air.</i>

142
00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.400
<i>Don't make the bike worse.</i>

143
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.400
<i>Hey! Bring that toolbox over here. </i>

144
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.760
<i>Get the appropriate one. You've been here for so many years.</i>

145
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.650
- <i>I think this handle is a little low.
- Yes.</i>

146
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.910
- <i>That's enough.</i>
- Who is that?

147
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.910
- Who?
- That guy.

148
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.210
He's been looking at you all afternoon.

149
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.870
Hey! I'm coming!

150
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.800
What are you drawing?

151
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.460
I'm coming!

152
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.140
Hello, Weiyang?

153
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.540
How has school been? Are you used to living in a dorm?

154
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.490
Don't even mention it. I fainted during the military training.

155
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.190
So many people were watching. So embarrassing!

156
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.310
How did that happen? How are you now?

157
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.890
I'm fine now. It was just too hot.

158
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.690
How did the school take care of it? Did you go see a doctor?

159
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:43.130
A male classmate sent me to the school infirmary.

160
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.060
Which male classmate is so lucky?

161
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:53.570
Also, school just started, but my teacher already separated us into groups. Guess who my partner is.

162
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.760
Who is it?

163
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.210
The male classmate who sent me to the infirmary!

164
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.480
Weiyang, you must be careful of your health. If it's hot, drink more water.

165
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.990
In the morning, it's best to drink a cup of warm water on an empty stomach.

166
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.810
Also, remember to eat your meals on time.

167
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:13.840
On the weekends, you have to come home, and I'll make some nourishing meals for you.

168
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.290
Enough, enough! I got it. I'm going to the library now.

169
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.990
Alright.

170
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.170
Come in.

171
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.510
Boss, here's the list of outstanding students that you wanted.

172
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.720
I can't understand. The company has just started.

173
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.140
Why are you doing these scholarships?

174
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.090
What is your opinion?

175
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.930
Could it be to promote the company?

176
00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.440
Even a tree takes ten years to grow. If late by just one day, I might miss out on an exceptional worker.

177
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.360
I'm making preparations in advance.

178
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.110
If you're going to be like this, why don't you become a principal?

179
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.850
Are you going to let me read this or not?

180
00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.200
Go ahead and read it. I'm going now.

181
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.690
Ning Xin. Sure, I also want to see you for something.

182
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.220
Okay. I'm going there now.

183
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.820
<i>[Personal Data: Jiang Sheng]</i>

184
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.540
If you had delayed your return for a few days, I would be able to invite you to visit my shop.

185
00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.000
Your shop?

186
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.760
Recently, I've been renovating a bar.

187
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.250
I heard that you were in the business of making and selling art? How is it that...

188
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:50.590
Haven't you heard that all young women have a dream of having a coffee bar?

189
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.120
Sadly, I'm no longer a young woman,

190
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.640
so a coffee bar doesn't really suit me.

191
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.520
Last year, I went to Shimokitazawa and accidentally entered a small pub.

192
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.930
People in all walks of life were there, and I found it interesting, so it gave me the idea.

193
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.190
At the same time, the owner was rushing to sell it, so I bought it.

194
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.800
You are still so carefree.

195
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.720
How about congratulating me?

196
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.390
Congratulations.

197
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.580
What's the matter?

198
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.960
It feels like this isn't real somehow.

199
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.620
We haven't seen each other for 10 years, but I don't feel any strangeness or nervousness.

200
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.800
Indeed. If you didn't say it, I also wouldn't have noticed it.

201
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.750
Oh, right, I heard that you're back to your old company.

202
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.790
True.

203
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.170
Then, how long do you plan to stay around this time?

204
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.560
I don't plan on going back for the time being.

205
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.970
Have you forgotten? I want to change the world.

206
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:07.020
But the difference this time is that I want to take you with me to change the world.

207
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.230
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:16.400
Back then, you had no other option. But now, do you want to start over again for your own sake?

209
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.620
Don't stir up trouble. My life is already set.

210
00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.130
If you're really resigned to that fate,

211
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:34.360
then why are you forcing yourself get an EMBA, even though you are not lacking the money?

212
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.340
And you have to enter the art industry, travel left and right,

213
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.890
seeing different sights, meeting different kinds of people.

214
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.160
Even to the point of find safe harbor in your own bar.

215
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.270
So, you know everything already?

216
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.960
How many years have I known you?

217
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.780
All the things you said today

218
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.540
don't sound like old friends reminiscing upon the past; more like talking with a headhunter.

219
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.820
Right. I'm definitely 'headhunting' you.

220
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.810
Thanks for accepting my offer.

221
00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.350
Bottoms up.

222
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.860
You're sure it's this account?

223
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.530
Yes. I asked the financial director. He said it is this one.

224
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.970
Such a big company, but all it has is rotten accounts.

225
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.420
At first, I was really shocked too.

226
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.500
For the last five years, the sale of real estate and the profit from it don't match at all.

227
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.660
Also, the cultural company overspends for every production.

228
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.400
The paper media industry also keeps saying, "Our industry is in a slump."

229
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.560
Especially that mine.

230
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.800
The mine in Weijiaping is over budget every year.

231
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.130
- Weijiaping? 
 - Yes.

232
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:07.080
A mine?

233
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.180
The people responsible for this mine are called Bei Guoxiong and He Manhou.

234
00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.200
For all these years, they have always worked under Wang Dehui.

235
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.460
I'm not talking about that.

236
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.180
Qian Zhi, let me ask you a question.

237
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.620
Did my aunt...

238
00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.190
Oh, right. I'm not sure about that.

239
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.100
Back then, Grandfather had the idea of obtaining the rights to that mine.

240
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.030
But after his bid was successful, he didn't take any more interest in it.

241
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.570
- Investigate these two, Bei Guoxiong and He Manhou.
- Okay.

242
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.300
Why are you still standing?

243
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.730
There's something I would like you to look at, grandfather.

244
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.620
Keep it short.

245
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.500
Wang Dehui had a hand in causing the deficit in the company.

246
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.450
Do you really need to be so ruthless?

247
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.400
Will you really allow them to take everything from the company so wilfully?

248
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.370
Grandfather, do you know what Wang Dehui said during the press conference?

249
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:28.270
He said that it's time for Shifeng Group to have a new ruler, and he'll leave an empty shell behind.

250
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.800
Hui Zi won't do that.

251
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.320
They are the ones who followed me through thick and thin.

252
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.880
If the waters are too clear, no fish can survive. If something

253
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.750
really happens to the Cheng family, those people

254
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.360
will support me with their lives.

255
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.900
It was so in the past when they had no vested interest.

256
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.420
But this does not mean that it is the same now.

257
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.870
Grandfather, I know that

258
00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.180
they and you established Shifeng through years of sheer hard work.

259
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.580
When I was little, I was overwhelmed by emotions when you told me these stories.

260
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.500
I wanted so much then to follow you and these brothers 
 to venture out.

261
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.170
But times are different now.

262
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:16.240
To guard our business enterprise without changes or forging ahead would lead to decline.

263
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.460
I do not mean to prove that you are wrong, Grandfather.

264
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.110
It's just that for the company to develop optimally,

265
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.770
a good system is more important than these feelings.

266
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.600
What the company needs most now is to hire a professional CEO.

267
00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.360
Stop talking.

268
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.550
You think that after you have been gilded in gold these years while overseas,

269
00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.610
you can forget about your past after you returned?

270
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.230
Tianyou!

271
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.090
Tianyou, why are you in this room?

272
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.060
I suddenly missed Aunt.

273
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.160
Nanny Liu, what does that box contain?

274
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.050
Actually, it contains your late aunt's belongings.

275
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.890
When this box was shipped here that year,

276
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.200
your grandfather fainted upon seeing it.

277
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.860
No one would mention what is in the box after that. We never touch it since.

278
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.370
I understand.

279
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.520
Xiao Jiu.

280
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.500
Why not you repair it after we have watched the movie?

281
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.980
I'm not going.

282
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.980
My classmates have all seen it.

283
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.770
It's really good! If you don't go, you'll surely regret it.

284
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.950
How about I go buy the tickets to whatever movie you want to see?

285
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.340
But... Tell me then.

286
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.370
Tell me how to get you to go watch a movie with me.

287
00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.360
Have you ridden a motorbike before?

288
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.880
- No.
- You dare to ask me on a date when you haven't ridden a motorbike before?

289
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.520
Do you mean to tell me, if I can ride this bike, you will go to the movies with me?

290
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.100
Yes.

291
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.500
Based on our gait,

292
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.480
I might have injured my kidneys.

293
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.340
Alright, alright, alright.

294
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.800
Why did you force yourself to ride the bike when you don't know how to?

295
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.680
I just want to go to the movies with you.

296
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.320
Do you really need to sacrifice your life for a movie with me?

297
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.170
Who said we're just watching one movie?

298
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.970
Alright, just sit.

299
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.000
Let me tell you.

300
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.950
This was just an accident.

301
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.140
When I'm better,

302
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.040
we'll do this again.

303
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.280
I think I will pillion you next time.

304
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.730
Keep your promises.

305
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.660
Pillion me.

306
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.190
- Lie on your stomach.
- Do I have to?

307
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.310
No!

308
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:54.330
My waist was hurt. Why are you pulling my pants?

309
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.530
Why are you behaving like a girl, when you are a man? If I do not pull your pants down,

310
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.960
I will have to stick the plaster on your pants.

311
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.540
My skin is quite fair, right?

312
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.700
You are too dark.

313
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.850
- Do you want me to stick the plaster? 
- Yes.

314
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.470
Here?

315
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.930
Yes, right here. Right here.

316
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.820
If it is not the kidneys, then it is the waist.

317
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:23.200
Us bikers often

318
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.520
get hurt.

319
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.330
This plaster is the best.

320
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:28.980
You will be well after a few days.

321
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.540
Do not move too much for the next couple of days and rest well

322
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.290
I am alone and injured at the waist.

323
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:40.680
Now, I can't walk around properly. Before I can recover from my injuries,

324
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.530
I might starve to death at home.

325
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:45.560
So you want me to bring food to you everyday?

326
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.420
- It hurts.
- It still hurts?

327
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.280
It hurts!

328
00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.640
This research is broken into multiple steps.

329
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.390
Determine the objective. Design the questionnaire.

330
00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.700
Distribute the questionnaire and data analysis.

331
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.420
In designing an analytic questionnaire, logically, you can put

332
00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.200
the closed questions in front and then the open questions at the end.

333
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.880
Only after perfecting the design of your questionnaire can you get data that is valuable for research.

334
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.260
Okay. Then this time, let's start with the research objective of our questionnaire then.

335
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.020
Okay.

336
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.360
I'll go help you find a few more books.

337
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.680
Why is that girl always clinging on you?

338
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.390
Research work. We got paired as a team.

339
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:54.000
The way I see it, the research isn't her main goal.

340
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.590
Her main goal is to flirt with you.

341
00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.800
Did you think everyone's like you, thinking about playing all day?

342
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.030
I don't mean anything by this.

343
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.440
I'm just afraid these female classmates will disturb your studies.

344
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.470
If there are female classmates like her in the future, send them to me.

345
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.670
I'll accompany them in touring the sea of knowledge.

346
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.460
Do you even have any knowledge? Read a book first.

347
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.370
- This class is so difficult. 
- I agree.

348
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.920
Jiang Sheng, hi.

349
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.400
Hello.

350
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.990
- You're Liangsheng's younger sister, right?
- Yes.

351
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.300
I'm Weiyang, his classmate.

352
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.570
Oh, hello.

353
00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:58.270
He and I were just in the library, but he rushed off right after we came out of there.

354
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.660
I think he went to his tutoring session.

355
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.060
He isn't your biological brother, right?

356
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.410
He is.

357
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.420
Why are you two in the same grade, then?

358
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:16.440
Our family is poor, so my brother attended university late by two years.

359
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.570
So that's how it is.

360
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.970
I'm so envious of you. You have such a good brother.

361
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.080
My brother is indeed very good.

362
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.980
Okay, class is over.

363
00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.560
Jiang Sheng.

364
00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.150
Can I trouble you to pass this letter to Liangsheng?

365
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:48.470
- Can you help?
- Yes, okay.

366
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.380
Thank you, thank you so much!

367
00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:03.580
Hi, can I trouble you to pass this to your brother?

368
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.930
Open it and let me have a look.

369
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:11.380
I want to learn from it.

370
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.500
Are you feeling envious?

371
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.710
Who is envious?

372
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.790
I want to take a critical look at them.

373
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:21.390
I want to see why they do not put their efforts into studying when they are in school.

374
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.620
While they are in their youth,

375
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.010
why do they think about dating instead of immersing themselves in the ocean of knowledge?

376
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.490
The more I think about it, the angrier I feel.

377
00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:33.770
I heard that you know a girl called Xiao Jiu. Which class is she from?

378
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.550
Which class? Use your toes to think of an answer!

379
00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:43.300
Would I, Brother Wu, be interested in little girls from your school?

380
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.990
I know your taste.

381
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.600
Your brother's taste is even more unique.

382
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.430
What's wrong with him?

383
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:59.930
You really don't know?

384
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.240
Your brother and Weiyang.

385
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.060
Why didn't he tell me about this?

386
00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.900
Why does your brother need to report to you about his relationships?

387
00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:21.960
It's like me and Xiao Jiu. This is adult business.

388
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.410
What's wrong?

389
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.170
The color of your face is like my test papers: pale and white.

390
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.850
Stop it.

391
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.800
I'm so happy that my brother as a girlfriend. I'll go back to Weijiaping and set off firecrackers for him.

392
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.410
Hey, Jiang Sheng!

393
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.050
Liangsheng.

394
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.730
What are you doing here?

395
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.040
Shall we go eat together?

396
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.080
No, I am waiting for Jiang Sheng and the others.

397
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.490
Oh, really? Maybe another day.

398
00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:03.620
Okay. Their classes should be over by now. I am going to look for them.

399
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.540
Liangsheng, wait a moment.

400
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.240
Am I someone who would spout nonsense?

401
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.250
Thank you.

402
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:16.440
Then, I'll be off now.

403
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:24.200
Don't mention this later.

404
00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.550
Don't worry. I am a man of few words and a well-guarded mouth.

405
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.360
Why were you dismissed from class so late today? You two must be very hungry.

406
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.210
What is this?

407
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.450
You don't like the food today?

408
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.300
It's okay.

409
00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:05.360
Brother, did you read those letters which you received today?

410
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.820
I can't even finish reading my books. How would I have the time to read those letters?

411
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.540
Let me read them for you. I can learn from them too.

412
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.680
Those letters belong to my brother. Why would you want to read them?

413
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:24.210
Look! Listen to how you talk. Do you know why your brother is so popular but you are not?

414
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.950
Why do all the girls like my brother?

415
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.560
Why do all the girls like my brother?

416
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.820
This is because your brother has such a handsome friend like me beside him!

417
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.610
Do you believe it? Of course it's because your brother is smart and handsome.

418
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.270
Am I pretty?

419
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:47.640
Yes.

420
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.450
Are my grades good?

421
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.040
Yes! Let's eat, let's eat.

422
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.300
After our meal, I will bring you to meet someone important.

423
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.850
Let's eat.

424
00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:07.120
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Never Sad Team @ Viki</i>

425
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:16.250
Xiaowu!

426
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.290
That's her.

427
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:23.070
What's going on here?

428
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.280
What's up with all the motorcycles?

429
00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.280
I brought these so that you can show off to your friends. It'll make an unforgettable impression on you.

430
00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.900
Yes, quite unforgettable.

431
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.080
Xiaowu, is this your girlfriend?

432
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.290
It's more like I'm a friend to everybody.

433
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.270
Look how she says it, better than how our professor would say it. A friend to everyone.

434
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:50.520
Here are my friends Liangsheng, Jiang Sheng.

435
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.510
Xiao Jiu.

436
00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.150
You have such a pretty girl by your side.

437
00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.970
How am I supposed to feel at ease?

438
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.410
Rabbits even eat the grass from their own nest, right?

439
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.190
Grass?

440
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:07.790
She is a bundle of firewood!

441
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.720
She's my little sister.

442
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.740
Little sister. If you say she's your little sister,

443
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.470
am I supposed to believe it?

444
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.090
Don't worry.  She's Xiaowu's and my little sister.

445
00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.180
Plus, didn't you say you're a friend to everyone?

446
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.820
When the day comes that you succeed in becoming Xiaowu's girlfriend,

447
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.170
then you can worry about this problem.

448
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.740
Interesting. I like that.

449
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.030
Let's go. I'll show my motorcycles.

450
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.190
<i>On this day,</i>

451
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:57.740
<i>the free and easy Xiao Jiu bursted into the lives of the three of us.</i>

452
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.550
<i>We'd never seen Bei Xiaowu care for a girl</i>

453
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:06.380
<i>like he cares for Xiao Jiu.</i>

454
00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.400
<i>The crazier Xiao Jiu was,</i>

455
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.540
<i>the more Xiaowu was captivated by her.</i>

456
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.020
<i>Because of Xiao Jiu's appearance, our group of three,</i>

457
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.900
<i>changed into a group of four.</i>

458
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:37.500
Liangsheng, what you usually like to eat?

459
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.630
I realized I don't really understand what you like.

460
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.710
Liangsheng?

461
00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.190
Oh.

462
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.860
What do you usually like to eat?

463
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.200
I eat anything.

464
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.210
How can that be?

465
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.580
Eating is something to be enjoyed.

466
00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:01.160
Look, Jiangzhe cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Shanghai food...

467
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.380
The flavors are all different.

468
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.600
- I like to eat countryside cuisine.
- Countryside cuisine?

469
00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.990
Then, is there something you especially like?

470
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:14.430
Plain boiled noodles.

471
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.230
Plain boiled noodles?

472
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.330
Is it that kind of noodles boiled in plain water?

473
00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.420
Yes.

474
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.400
What's special about that?

475
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.140
The noodles boiled at home

476
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.970
aren't the most special,

477
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.140
but I miss them the most.

478
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.120
Homemade.

479
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.930
Enough of that. We need to hurry.

480
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.460
The library will close soon.

481
00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:37.710
Oh.

482
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.380
Homemade.

483
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.820
Where are you going?

484
00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.660
The Warm Winters Society is holding an event.

485
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.460
You don't give yourself time for any rest. Besides working parttime, you also do volunteer work.

486
00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.060
Enough. I'm going. Bye bye.

487
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.920
Bye bye.

488
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.510
So busy!

489
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.500
For you.

490
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:09.630
Hey, wait a second.

491
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.400
You have to tell me first, is your blood sugar high?

492
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.430
Not high.

493
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.380
Cholesterol?

494
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.060
Everything's normal.

495
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:19.730
Normal?

496
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.300
The doctor said that I can eat whatever I'd like.

497
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:28.470
Okay. Eat to your heart's content, then.

498
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.800
You're not lying to me, right?

499
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.810
You doubt me?

500
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.410
Then take it back. I don't want any.

501
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.660
- No, no. 
 - Don't give it to me. I'm not eating.

502
00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.560
No, no, no.

503
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.660
I don't doubt you.

504
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.040
I was just asking.

505
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.640
Hurry, here's the flavor you like.

506
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.300
Strawberry flavored.

507
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.690
You don't like strawberry?

508
00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:57.080
I've changed.

509
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.010
Vanilla flavor?

510
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.680
Is it good?

511
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.990
The only ones who like sweets

512
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.940
in the Cheng family is me

513
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.250
and your aunt, Xiao Qing.

514
00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.500
True.

515
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.610
Aunt also really liked to eat these.

516
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.230
Aiya! As soon as I mention your aunt...look at you.

517
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.440
Such a long face looks like a rotten cucumber.

518
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.720
If your aunt's spirit in heaven finds out,

519
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.570
she'll scold you again.

520
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.910
All right. You wait.

521
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.160
I'll go brew some Chinese hawthorn tea for you.

522
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.040
No, don't. I have to go in a minute.

523
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:55.240
This tea has hawthorn, malt, and dried tangerine peel in it.

524
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.230
This tea becomes sweet and sour, delicious.

525
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.200
Excellent for your digestion; especially suited for you.

526
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.920
Looks like you've learned some new skills.

527
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.210
In order to be a good influence on you guys,

528
00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.140
I formed the habit of constantly learning new skills.

529
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.770
There's that young girl who always comes to visit me.

530
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:18.780
And she even makes me...

531
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.000
Hey, Tianyou,

532
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.280
this year,

533
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.030
you're thirty something years old.

534
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.300
Wait, wait.

535
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.940
I'll be back in a minute. I need to tell you something.

536
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.300
I don't have time. I really have to go.

537
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.580
You can't. Listen to me. Just wait. I'll be back in a minute.

538
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.700
I really have to go.

539
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.350
Right away.

540
00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.930
Okay, I got it.

541
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.000
Didn't I tell you to sit outside and wait for me? Huh? You...

542
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.370
Aiyo! Jiang Sheng's here.

543
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.620
Do you have guests, Grandmother Liu?

544
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.470
No. That...

545
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.000
You came just in time.

546
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.050
Let's go, come with me.

547
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:20.750
Hurry.

548
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.940
This... I told him to wait right here.

549
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.710
That kid.

550
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.210
He thinks he's grown up now.

551
00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.890
Who are you talking about, grandmother?

552
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.350
- Who? 
- You'll find out later.

553
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.320
Here, I brought you some flowers.

554
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.280
Didn't you say you weren't sleeping well lately? This can calm your nerves.

555
00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.410
These...

556
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.710
I've haven't seen these flowers before.

557
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:58.270
How about we go arrange these flowers? Then I'll play chess with you.

558
00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.650
I'm not playing. You're a lousy chess player.

559
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.550
Then, don't I need to practice more? That way, I can catch up with your eldest grandson.

560
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.000
Aiyo!

561
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.840
You want to beat my eldest grandson

562
00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.810
in chess? Impossible.

563
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.470
It's impossible.

564
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.150
Sir, you're looking for me?

565
00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.310
Tianyou...

566
00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.550
I want to ask him about returning to the company.

567
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.210
He went to see Liu Xing.

568
00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:40.040
Liu Xing has run the Cheng family for so many years

569
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.910
She helped me raise Tianyou's father and Tianyou.

570
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.780
Now that she's old, she lives alone. We cannot forget

571
00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.650
her kindness.

572
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:54.980
Don't worry. According to your instructions, she's being taken care over these years.

573
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.610
Since Tianyou was young, he's been close to Liu Xing.

574
00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:01.510
The first thing he did when he came back was to go see her.

575
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:06.170
There's no way she would be treated unkindly.

576
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:08.980
You, as Tianyou's Uncle Qian,

577
00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.200
have protected Tianyou since he was young.

578
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.340
Every time I'm about to scold him,

579
00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:20.430
you think up some method to reassure me.

580
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.680
I just don't want him dawdling around outside anymore.

581
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.600
He should come back and take over Shifeng.

582
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.540
Tianyou was taught by you

583
00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.190
to handle matters with careful consideration.

584
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.100
He knows who deserves his gratitude and who deserves resent.

585
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.010
These years when he's been out of the country, he's established his career.

586
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.770
If he comes back to Shifeng,

587
00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.870
he'd definitely drastically renovate the company,

588
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.600
make the company entirely new.
