19
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.580
Liangsheng.

20
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.490
It's so late. Why did you come here?

21
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.350
This is for you.

22
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.870
What is this?

23
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.090
This is my first time cooking, it probably isn't good.

24
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510
You made it yourself?

25
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.770
Yes. So you must eat it.

26
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.190
Then, I'll go now.

27
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.210
Bye bye.

28
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.290
<i>Chairman Wang, there's been a major problem.</i>

29
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.660
<i>Cheng Tianyou came back this time aiming for you.</i>

30
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.290
Why do you say that?

31
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.660
Not regarding whether this news is fake or not,

32
00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.940
I heard he has also been secretly investigating your personal assets

33
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.530
in order to force you into a corner,

34
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.170
and build up his reputation in the corporation.

35
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.350
How can he have so much power when he just returned back from overseas?

36
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.510
You don't know,

37
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.520
but there is a person called Ning Xin who is with him.

38
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.590
- Ning Xin? 
- Yes.

39
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.950
Two days ago, I had purposely done some research on this Ning Xin.

40
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.640
She is someone who is in the arts. She would have connections.

41
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.690
They probably want to involve others in buying their resources.

42
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.070
No wonder. No wonder he was able to

43
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.150
get connections so quickly.

44
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.100
But Chairman Wang, I am quite worried.

45
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.690
You say, do you think Chairman Cheng would be affected by this?

46
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.980
The old man and I create this company.

47
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.570
If Third Older Brother and Fourth Older Brother were still alive, I wouldn't have said anything.

48
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.240
What is Cheng Tianyou to me?

49
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.720
Why should I give him anything?

50
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.510
- Help me arrange a meeting with Old Sir Cheng.
- Okay.

51
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.510
I say, Old Man.

52
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.420
Tianyou is back now. It should be time for me to hand up my spot, right?

53
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.800
I'll just take that you didn't saying anything.

54
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.780
And don't say such a thing like that in the future.

55
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.220
You have to work for a lifetime.

56
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.430
Tianyou is a returnee from overseas, he has a lot of strength, the Jiangshan of Shi Feng.

57
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.450
Sooner or later, this will be run by the youth.

58
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.320
But he is one who is fearless, so it's a long run from being able to take over this responsibility.

59
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.910
Okay.

60
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.200
Since you have said matters like this, what words could I possibly give?

61
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.130
Then what about this?

62
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.020
I won't have this tea anymore.

63
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.870
I still have a pile of work over there.

64
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.790
I'll leave first, may I?

65
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.590
Go.

66
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.900
Okay.

67
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.180
Chairman Cheng. There are some matters.

68
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.490
What's the matter?

69
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.210
In this short amount of time, I have already received four resignation letters from managers.

70
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.350
Stupid he must be.

71
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.850
Then, what do you say about these resignation letters?

72
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.790
Let Dehui go and pacify them.

73
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.780
Ask them

74
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.310
what they are unsatisfied with.

75
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.550
Okay.

76
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.860
I hope you'll know when to stop.

77
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.350
Don't be befuddled enough to not understand.

78
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.530
So what if it changed to Tianyou?

79
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.090
It's the Cheng family who makes the final call.

80
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.450
What does it have to do with us? Besides,

81
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.560
this is what Wang Dehui wanted us to do.

82
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.910
If there really is a mistake, he's the one who is going to take the fall.

83
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.560
<i>The accounts are all in your possession. As long as you don't show up, no one can find out.</i>

84
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.180
<i>If you want to shut my mouth, you know what to do.</i>

85
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.530
I still have something to do. I'm hanging up first.

86
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.900
Guoxiong, let's eat. Guoxiong.

87
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.620
--Coming. 
-Let's eat.

88
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.400
Dinner is ready?

89
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.840
I was on the phone earlier, I didn't hear.

90
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.030
-Here are the clams you like. 
- You eat.

91
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.730
Guoxiong, what's wrong?

92
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.430
Nothing. Oh right.

93
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.550
In the future, don't pick up calls from people you don't know.

94
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.550
Is there something that happened?

95
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.960
It's hard to explain in one or two sentences.

96
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.100
Just don't pick them up.

97
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.160
Ok, I'll listen to you.

98
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120
Hurry up and eat while it's hot.

99
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.060
Why does it feel like the library closed so early?

100
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.910
That's because you were focused on studying.

101
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.930
Hurry and call your mom. My mom said your dad is in the hospital.

102
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.560
<i>[sighing]</i>

103
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.520
Hello Mom? Dad is in the hospital?

104
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.470
Yes, it's nothing much.

105
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.130
Just a fever.

106
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.820
The doctor wants to watch over him for awhile.

107
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.070
Is it serious? I'll head back tomorrow.

108
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.930
Aiyo, don't bother. How much time will be wasted if you were to come and go back.

109
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.640
Study well, everything is fine, I'm here.

110
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.690
Alright then. Mom, then remember to ventilate the hospital room.

111
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.180
And if necessary, give my dad a mask to prevent contagious infections.

112
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.900
I know, the doctor already informed me. You don't have to worry about these things, alright?

113
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.800
Mom, you've also worked hard taking care of Dad. Remember to take care of yourself.

114
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.890
If she's too busy, let my mom go help out.

115
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.820
<i>Okay, I know.</i>

116
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:09.490
Mom, do you need money? I'll send you some.

117
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.390
We have enough money.

118
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.900
You don't have to worry about money.

119
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.770
<i>Take care of Jiangsheng. And take care of yourself too. Don't stay up all night studying.</i>

120
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.920
Alright, I'm hanging up now.

121
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.170
I'm going to clean up and go to see your dad in the hospital.

122
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.460
Alright.

123
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.710
It's okay. It's just a cold, he needs a bit of care.

124
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.200
Living in the hospital? Then that must mean it costs money.

125
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.420
It's alright. If you don't have money, just go ask my mother.

126
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:47.750
It's alright. Tomorrow, I'll find more tutoring jobs.

127
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.690
How about this? I'll get a job as well.

128
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.200
Don't worry about it. You stay in class, and study well.

129
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.990
-Tomorrow I'll go and buy some dietary supplements for my dad and send it over. 
-I'll go buy them.

130
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.920
Don't worry about it.

131
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.840
Don't worry.

132
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:11.000
<i>[sigh]</i>

133
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.650
I went to Tianyu Square just to buy this for you. Eat.

134
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.410
Thank you.

135
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.940
Although you may not be outstanding, you're still skilled.

136
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.320
There's no superior or inferior work. It's fine as long as there's money to be earned.

137
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.290
Don't tell Jiang Sheng about my job.

138
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.930
- She doesn't know?
- She doesn't know.

139
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.780
I want to take on a few more jobs. This way, I can earn more money, and she can relax more.

140
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.460
<i>Jiang Liangsheng. Where did you put the coffee beans?</i>

141
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.840
Let me find it, please wait.

142
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.710
<i>- They won't even let people eat in peace.</i>
- It's fine. I'm not hungry anyway. You eat.

143
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:27.510
I don't care if you're hungry or not. I went all that way to buy this for you.You really don't appreciate me.

144
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.130
Here. I'll do it with you.

145
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.770
Have you ever washed dishes?

146
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.680
You're looking down on me. Wash dishes?

147
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.560
I've even washed tattoos.

148
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.260
That really isn't a job fit for people.

149
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.370
I'm beat.

150
00:10:54.470 --> 00:11:00.610
You should sleep on the bed. I've just changed the bedding. I'm so lazy to change, so I'll sleep on the sofa.

151
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:04.050
You don't have to worry about me. I can sleep anywhere.

152
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.890
I forgot to tell you throughout the day. My mom said that your dad is doing a lot better.

153
00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.560
I gave him a call and asked about it. He's doing much better.

154
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.590
I almost forgot.

155
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.190
Take the money. It's for your dad's treatment.

156
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.860
You helped me wash the dishes. That's already enough.

157
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.090
Take it and use it! Do you really see me as a brother?

158
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:49.320
I don't need it. I appreciate your kindness, but don't worry about me. I can handle it.

159
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.960
I can't do anything that can help you.You-

160
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.520
Hurry and sleep! Thank you.

161
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.310
How come all bad luck must be encountered by your family?

162
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.200
If possible, I really hope that some will get transferred into our family,

163
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.640
so we can share some of the burden of your family.

164
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.850
Here.

165
00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.750
I also like to come this kind of place sometimes to unwind.

166
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.540
Next time, if you're coming, remember to take me with you.

167
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.740
You're so busy. Stop joking.

168
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:51.170
As long as it's a place that you want to go, I will accompany you.

169
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.450
I knew that older brother treats me the best.

170
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.100
- Brother, am I important to you?
- Of course.

171
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.270
You are the person I care about the most.

172
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.840
Really? I must firmly keep you on my watch.

173
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.590
I won't let anyone take you away.

174
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.560
How come you're still acting like a child?

175
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:29.060
I'm now back in the country. As long as you need me, I will appear anytime.

176
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.640
You said it.

177
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.400
Last night, Wang Dehui went to see some

178
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:46.410
main executives of the company. They are Jiang Yihe, Zhou Bieshan, Jia Dongjie.

179
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.160
All are his people. After the defections yesterday, they are just in disarray.

180
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.160
Then, what about the CFO of Shifeng?

181
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.460
He said that he wants to meet you.

182
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.680
- It's not yet time.
- This person looks very anxious.

183
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.430
I feel that he has something to tell you.

184
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.460
Someone who is willingly coming to you, is it a meat or a bait?

185
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.690
Are you temporarily not going to Shifeng?

186
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.840
- Investigate things for me first.
- Okay.

187
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.590
Hey, one more thing.

188
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.970
Tian'en is acting a bit weird. Find out why. If you can't handle them all, leave the ones earlier to someone else.

189
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.700
Okay.

190
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.500
Why did you bring me here? Facing the wall to reflect?

191
00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.390
Are you kidding?

192
00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:53.160
For a shameless person like me, when did I reflect on my actions?

193
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.630
I want to show you my skills.

194
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:03.260
- Can you do it? 
- This wall is especially for public graffiti.

195
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.390
Starting today, this wall is just like me. It has your name etched on it.

196
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.110
All are yours.

197
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.300
How did I do?

198
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.000
Five? Nine?

199
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.060
- What? You are complaining my work is bad?
- Impossible.

200
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.430
1-9, 2-9, won't do anything. 3-9, 4-9, walking on ice. 5-9, 6-9, watching the willows along the river.

201
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.140
7-9, the river opens. 8-9, the swallow comes. 9-9, add one more 9, the farming buffalo walks everywhere.

202
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.590
It's watching the willows along the river! So exuberant!

203
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.390
- Are you saying that I'm uncultured?!
- No!

204
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.810
- Are you saying that I'm uncultured?!
- This has such profound meaning!

205
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.530
- Are you saying that I'm uncultured?!
- No...

206
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.420
How come the list of scholars has not yet come out?

207
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:41.540
Weird. Didn't they say that it will be announced today?

208
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.650
Don't rush. Maybe we should wait for 1 or 2 more days.

209
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.820
Let's go.

210
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:56.640
If the scholarship comes out, I can then help my father with the medical bills and let my older brother do less part-time jobs.

211
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.860
You two are really so pitiful.

212
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:05.200
But your admission grade was very good, so your scholarship is a sure thing.

213
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.420
I saw the things you're doing outside.

214
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.960
It is indeed good, but when do you plan to enter the company

215
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.620
and face those things that you must face sooner or later?

216
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.030
I didn't say that I won't enter Shifeng.

217
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.530
Give me your word then.

218
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.490
I want a definite time.

219
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.950
What I'm waiting for is not time, but an opportunity.

220
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:42.310
You kept thinking that I'm just staying on the side and observing the fire. Not caring at all. But only through this can we see the problem, forcing them to make mistakes.

221
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.830
Once you find the problem, this big fire

222
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.710
has burned to the point that there is no more Cheng family within Shifeng.

223
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.570
The choice is with you. I have nothing to say.

224
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:03.000
I indeed was wrong about Wang Dehui, but I won't deny that he has capabilities.

225
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.180
I will let go sooner or later.

226
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.250
If there is really no choice,

227
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:14.710
I will give him Shifeng!

228
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.930
Grandfather.

229
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.590
Hello.

230
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.270
I'm the one applying for the math teacher position. My name is Jiang Liangsheng.

231
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.010
How can a late teacher teach a child?

232
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.840
Please excuse me, I had an accident on the way here, I'm extremely sorry.

233
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:03.230
What time is it? I still have something to do later, my time is precious. Go home.

234
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:11.100
I'm not deliberately making things hard for you. I have an appointment and must go out later. This tutor session today can't proceed.

235
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.750
Thank you.

236
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:22.840
I made this plan for the child, I hope it helps him. Let him take a look at it first.

237
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.850
- Goodbye.
- Teacher Jiang, wait a minute.

238
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.340
How about this. I'm busy later, can you help Fan Fan study?

239
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.580
Just tell me about his situation next time. Our maid is at home. You can call her if you need anything.

240
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.850
- Sure. Don't worry.
- Please enter then.

241
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.390
- Do I need to remove my shoes?
-  No, no need. Please enter.
- Thanks.

242
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.040
Hello.

243
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.530
Hello. I'm your math tutor. I'm Jiang Sheng.

244
00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.180
There are calculators here, there are DVDs there. There are also manhuas and magazines.

245
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.050
Do whatever you want to do. Leave in an hour.

246
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:08.800
- Are you like this during your tutor sessions?
- My mother will still pay you and I won't tell her about it.

247
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.490
Do you hate studying?

248
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.970
I hate that I have so many tutors. At school, there's teachers.

249
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.430
After school, there still are teachers. It's all annoying.

250
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.380
Alright.

251
00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.770
I'll give you ten problems. If you get them all right, I won't come back.

252
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.240
Really?

253
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.200
You know how to do all these problems. Why does your mom say you're bad in school?

254
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.270
She's so busy all the time, how does she know I do well in school?

255
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.310
- You actually do like studying, am I right?
- None of your business.

256
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.550
Did all the tutor that your mother hired before got driven away by you like this?

257
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:11.830
Fan Fan, I think if you have any problems, you should talk and communicate more with your mom.

258
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.020
What use is in communicating? I can't see her all day.

259
00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.780
Your mother's outset is good.

260
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.660
I think if you have any ideas, just tell her. That way, she can understand you.

261
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:37.480
Based on our initial agreement, you won. This is a study plan that I made for you. I hope it can help.

262
00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:49.380
Teacher Jiang! It's so late, you still haven't left?

263
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.750
I was just waiting for you, fixing my bicycle.

264
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.180
I want to talk to you for a bit.

265
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.820
Is Fan Fan learning well?

266
00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:05.890
Fan Fan's comprehension skills is quite high and his basic math foundation is quite firm. He doesn't really need a tutor.

267
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:12.250
But I want to give you some advice. If you have time, spend more time with him. Listen to his feelings,

268
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:17.300
because studying is a great thing. Don't put too much pressure on him.

269
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.010
Right. Teacher Jiang, this is your paycheck.

270
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.060
It's alright. I didn't do too much.

271
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:31.120
- Just take it. You also didn't have it easy. 
- Really no need. Bye-bye.

272
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:44.720
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Never Sad Team @ Viki</i>

With this heavy of a rain, I'm here to cover you.

280
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.020
Take me home?

281
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.780
Get in the car. The dorms are going to lock soon.

282
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.240
Ok.

283
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.470
Thank you.

284
00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.870
It's alright, you guys first head in the car.

285
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.610
Thank you! Bye!

286
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.600
Brother.

287
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.780
Why are you still here this late?

288
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.300
I made you dinner.

289
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.480
How are you?

290
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.020
Pretty well.

291
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.190
Oh, ok.

292
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.210
Then I'll head back first. Rest early.

293
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:46.250
Jiang Sheng! Be careful!

294
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:26.800
Hey.

295
00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.110
Jiang Sheng!

296
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.190
What's wrong with you?

297
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.780
Nothing.

298
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.420
Not feeling well?

299
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.490
No. How are you?

300
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.790
Not feeling good.

301
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.490
Why are you sad?

302
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.250
Girls.

303
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.480
It's Xiao Jiu, isn't it?

304
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.680
I'll take you somewhere fun.

305
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.100
I'm not going, this late. Going where?

306
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.400
Let's go. You'll know when we get there. Let's have fun.

307
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.350
The dorms are going to lock soon.

308
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.070
Glenfiddich, 2 glasses.

309
00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.820
It's so noisy here.

310
00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.460
This is called an atmosphere!

311
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.080
Let's leave, I want to go back to school.

312
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.060
We just came, let's sit for a while first!

313
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.790
But the dorms are going to lock soon.

314
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.600
Who cares? Here.

315
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.700
Tell me what you're upset about.

316
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.350
I didn't get the scholarship. And...

317
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.050
And?

318
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.900
Nothing.

319
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.140
Drink a glass.

320
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.280
No. I won't drink, my brother doesn't let me drink.

321
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.220
Who cares?! Just treat it as using alcohol to drown the sorrow.

322
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.430
How is this good?

323
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.660
It is pretty strong. Forty percent.

324
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.020
- Cheers.
- Not bad.

325
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.620
Bring me another glass.

326
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.490
There was a breakthrough. I found...

327
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.290
The daughter of Bei Guoxiong's lover.

328
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.950
I can take care of this.

329
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.670
This matter concerns my aunt. I'll go.

330
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.560
I was going to give this to Xiao Jiu.

331
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.480
She didn't want it,

332
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.480
so you can have it.

333
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.990
I don't want it.

334
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.550
We drank to our heart's content today.

335
00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.690
If you don't accept it,

336
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.400
that is such a killjoy.

337
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.880
You have to wear it. You're pale, so it'll definitely look good on you.

338
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.350
Then... Then I'll give it to Xiao Jiu for you.

339
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.350
I'll talk to her.

340
00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:15.090
Hello. Are you Xiao Jiu?

341
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.890
I'm Cheng Tianyou from Shi Feng Group.

342
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:21.830
I'd like to ask for your help. Can you tell me where your mother is?

343
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.060
Why are you looking for my mom?

344
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.070
This concerns a business deficit case.

345
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.260
Perhaps your mother might know something about it.

346
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.750
Business deficit case?

347
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.190
- You must be kidding. I'm busy, so—
- Please wait a moment.

348
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.180
We don't mean any harm.

349
00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.430
We've been searching for your mother for a long time,

350
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.500
- but we haven't been able to find her.
- Xiao Jiu.

351
00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.240
Jiang Sheng?

352
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.990
- Jiang Sheng. What are you doing here?
- Xiao Jiu...

353
00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.960
Bei Xiaowu told me to give this to you.

354
00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.020
Make sure you keep it safe.

355
00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.470
Xiao Jiu...

356
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:06.400
Bei Xiaowu really likes you. Don't hurt him.

357
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.670
- Got it?
- Yeah, OK. I know.

358
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.960
I'm sorry. My friend's drunk so I have to send her home.

359
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.650
Sorry, excuse me. My friend had too much to drink.

360
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.240
Please wait a moment.

361
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.530
- Who are you guys?
- Hello.

362
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.980
Miss, you...

363
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.120
You're a man so why do you have a ponytail?

364
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.400
Miss, you've had too much to drink.

365
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.050
Trying to grope me...

366
00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:36.590
You've had too much to drink.

367
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.180
Who are you?

368
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.860
Miss.

369
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.950
Miss, he's our boss.

370
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.360
Xiao Jiu.

371
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.920
You didn't leave Bei Xiaowu for this guy, did you?

372
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.060
Who are you?

373
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:54.620
Do you know how much our Bei Xiaowu likes Xiao Jiu. We grew up with Bei Xiaowu...

374
00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:57.240
- Let go first...
- Let go of me!

375
00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:04.310
Bei Xiaowu's my best friend. Do you know how hurt I get when he's upset? How can you do something so unconscionable?

376
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.280
Chase!

377
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.250
Wait, wait.

378
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.810
Brother, why are you here?

379
00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:36.000
Take me home. Let's go home, Brother.

380
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:39.740
Bro...

381
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.510
- Wait a minute.
- Bro!

382
00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:45.560
Wait, wait. Sir, please wait a minute.

383
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.640
Bro, why are you pushing me? Bro?

384
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.650
Sir, please send her home.

385
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.190
Hey, kid, you can't leave.

386
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.930
You can't just shove a drunk girl into my car. What if she vomits in my car?

387
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.430
- I'll pay you if she vomits.
- That's what you say, but how am I supposed to find you later?

388
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.630
- I'll leave my contact information for you.
- You don't need to do that.

389
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.320
How about you just get in the car too? You can't just put this girl in my car.

390
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.010
What if something bad happens? It will be hard to clear my name.

391
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.390
- It's fine, it's fine. Just go. Go.
- Hey, kid. She keeps calling you bro.

392
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.100
If you don't get in the car, I'm not going to start the car. What kind of brother are you?

393
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.400
- Hurry and get in the car. If you don't, I'm not going anywhere. 
- OK, I'll get in.

394
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.330
Where are you headed?

395
00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.010
Hey, where do you live?

396
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.460
Say something. Where do you live?

397
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.450
- Up front.
- Up front where?

398
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:50.100
- How far up front? 
- I said it's up front. Just keep driving! Quit the chatter!

399
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.080
Sir, just keep driving straight for now.

400
00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:00.540
- Up front where? How far? 
- I don't have a home!

401
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.270
Okay already. Hey!

402
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.460
- Why aren't we home yet?
- Alright, thank you, sir.

403
00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:21.200
- Okay already.
- Don't go!
- Hey! Hey!

404
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.910
The car's leaving.

405
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:38.700
- You dare bully my friend?
- Keep walking.

406
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:44.290
You...let go of me! I haven't...

407
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.640
Where are you going?

408
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.860
Let go of me! Get away! Who are you? I'm going to beat you up.

409
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.590
- You're drunk. Who are you going to beat up?
- Xiao Jiu, I'll come save you.

410
00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.260
L-let go!

411
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.550
Get away! Who are you?!

412
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.090
Wait! Wait!

413
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:13.770
Over here!

414
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.990
- What is this place?
- Why aren't they picking up?

415
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.040
You threw up all over me!

416
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.480
Water... I want water.

417
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.900
- I want to drink water!
- It's coming!

418
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.530
Water.

419
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:58.850
Bro.

420
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.290
Is anyone there?

421
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.150
Is anyone there?

422
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:01.110
<i>Don't keep telling random men to take you home.</i>

423
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.300
What are you doing here?

424
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.470
I came to check on you. I was afraid that something might have happened you. For example, getting hit by a meteor.

425
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.460
I'm fine.

426
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.150
Jiang Sheng.

427
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.970
Good morning. Let's go.

428
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.100
- Huh? Go where? 
- Just come with me.

429
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.830
- Where are we going? 
- Hey!
- Let's go eat.

430
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:38.950
Jiang Sheng, here's to you. You're a great girl.

431
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.960
What's good about me? I always make my brother angry.

432
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:47.850
If I say you're good, then you're good. In my eyes, you're the best.

433
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:52.110
If you hadn't saved me last night, I don't know what I'd have done.

434
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.910
Last night?

435
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.830
- I don't remember what happened last night. 
- You don't know how amazing you were last night.

436
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:06.030
You directly charged into motorcycle shop and then protected me. No matter who, you wouldn't let them touch me. I was so shocked.

437
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.100
And you threw up all over that guy.

438
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:14.970
You got up in his face and said that I was ignoring Bei Xiaowu because of him.

439
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.890
Why don't I remember anything?

440
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:24.630
But that guy was pretty good looking. He'd be a match for your brother.

441
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.720
Here. Cheers to you.

442
00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.000
- I'd like to borrow these. 
- Give me your library card.

443
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:48.530
<i>And please don't take girls you don't know back home either.</i>

444
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.110
Jin Ling, what do I do if I lost my library card?

445
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.750
You should get another one made then.

446
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:26.470
It's really annoying to lose a library card.

447
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:30.420
School just started, and you already lost it?

448
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.440
Don't mention it. Something annoying happened.

449
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.240
Oh, right. You got marked as not returning to your dorm.

450
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.820
The school is quite strict about it lately. I'm worried that if you get marked again, you'll get a demerit.

451
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.480
No! My brother will get angry.

452
00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:49.890
Hence, hurry up and look for a reason to cancel this record from the dorm manager.

453
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.060
OK.

454
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.060
- Hello.
- Hello, Tianyou. Someone saw He Manhou.

455
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.640
<i>- It's Bei Guoxiong's accomplice.</i>
- Where?

456
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:20.910
We don't know his exact location, but someone said he's already gotten on a train and left Hebei.

457
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:27.260
- Keep searching. 
<i>- OK. I've sent you your itinerary for the day. Everything's set.</i> 
- OK.

458
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:39.590
Jiang Sheng, Landscape Design Department of Yuhua University.

459
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.410
That's right, sir.

460
00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.390
Sir? My name's Cheng.

461
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:48.210
Oh, OK, Mr. Cheng.

462
00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:51.760
My name's Cheng Tianyou.

463
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.750
Young people shouldn't drink that much.

464
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.880
Thank you, Mr. Cheng Tianyou.

465
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.060
