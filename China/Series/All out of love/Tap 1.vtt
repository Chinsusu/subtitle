<i>The vegetables are not bad today.</i>

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.010
<i>This is an exciting time. In a moment,</i>

5
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.610
<i>Hong Kong separated from its fatherland. A wanderer for half a century</i>

6
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.510
<i>has finally gone back to her mother to her love and embrace.</i>

7
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.300
<i>The whole world is watching this.</i>

8
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.290
<i>Everyone is anticipating the return of Hong Kong to</i>

9
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.410
<i>- the embrace of her motherland.
- Mom, I'm back.</i>

10
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.250
<i>Jiang Sheng, don't touch it. Put it back.</i>

11
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.090
Mom, I want to eat the egg.

12
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.710
<i>You can't.</i>

13
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.520
Mom, let me have a small bite.

14
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.160
<i>You can't. This is for your father.</i>

15
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.610
Dad? Dad won't definitely return for the new year.

16
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.760
I don't believe he will return.

17
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.620
<i>Your father said that he will be home today.</i>

18
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.850
I don't believe that he will be back. You are a liar.

19
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.780
Your father is a senior reporter. He's busy with the affairs of the country.

20
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.010
He wouldn't have that much time to keep us company. Eat this.

21
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.590
<i>Jiang Sheng! Jiang Sheng!</i>

22
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.890
<i>Jiang Sheng! Jiang Sheng!</i>

23
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.270
I'm coming.

24
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.120
Quick, we already made an appointment.

25
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.190
<i>Hurry up, Jiang Sheng.</i>

26
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.790
<i>Mom, I'm going to play with Bei Xiao Wu first.</i>

27
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.160
You are not going to eat?

28
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.660
- Is it fun?
- You are riding the horse.

29
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.320
<i>Be careful. Dad is making a right turn.</i>

30
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.130
- Right turn.
- Okay.

31
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.860
Uncle Bei, can you be my horse?

32
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.070
No. My father is my horse. No one else can ride on him.

33
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.750
Who's your horse? You ride on me every day. Let Jiang Sheng ride.

34
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.340
Get off.

35
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.460
- Okay, Dad.
- Come, Jiang Sheng.

36
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.360
<i>Are you ready?</i>

37
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.810
<i>You are riding the horse. We are knocking into them.</i>

38
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.560
Is it fun?

39
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.360
- Yes.
- It's fun?

40
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.520
<i>Doctor, did you see my family?</i>

41
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.570
<i>Did you see my family?</i>

42
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.960
<i>Doctor, did you see my family?</i>

43
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.410
<i>Doctor, did you see my family?</i>

44
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.870
<i>Doctor.</i>

45
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.430
<i>Nurse! Nurse!</i>

46
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.090
<i>Here, quick.</i>

47
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.320
<i>Nurse.</i>

48
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.620
<i>Nurse, did you see someone by the name of Jiang Liang?</i>

49
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.530
Over there. Go over there and check now.

50
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.480
<i>Did you see someone by the name of Jiang Liang?</i>

51
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.160
<i>We are busy. Check over there.</i>

52
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.850
<i>Look over there.</i>

53
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.630
<i>Look over there.</i>

54
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.270
<i>Doctor.</i>

55
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.970
<i>Doctor.</i>

56
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.790
<i>Did you see my family?</i>

57
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.820
<i>gave my family a big painful blow.</i>

58
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.000
<i>I didn't expect that my childhood would change.</i>

59
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.420
<i>Someone said that my father and a female reporter from the provincial capital came her to conduct an interview.</i>

60
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000
<i>At the same time, they had this kid.</i>

61
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.530
<i>Who's he? How is he related to my father?</i>

62
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.380
<i>My mother didn't say anything. They simply walked in silence.</i>

63
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.640
<i>One, two, one.</i>

64
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.320
<i>One, two, one.</i>

65
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.120
<i>One, two, one. One, two, one.</i>

66
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.220
Mom.

67
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.950
<i>Jiang Sheng, call him Older Brother in the future.</i>

68
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.400
<i>Greet him.</i>

69
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.060
I don't have an older brother.

70
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.720
He's your biological older brother in the future. Address him as your Older Brother.

71
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.920
Older Brother.

72
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.990
<i>Liang Sheng suddenly came into my world.</i>

73
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.610
<i>Older Brother, what's in your bag?</i>

74
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.550
<i>I couldn't and also didn't know how to ask</i>

75
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.750
<i>why this boy, Liang Sheng, suddenly came to our home.</i>

76
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.060
<i>I could only determined that he's my older brother.</i>

77
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.620
<i>As for me, I'm his younger sister.</i>

78
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.530
Older Brother, are you crying?  Are you afraid of the dark?

79
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.340
If you are afraid, I'm not. I will keep you company.

80
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.540
Come and eat. Sit over there.

81
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.540
Eat.

82
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.090
<i>Enough.</i>

83
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.970
Liang Sheng, take your younger sister into the house now.

84
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.820
<i>Return my man to me. That's right. It's your family.</i>

85
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.600
<i>I'm not leaving. I'm very sad. I want to settle score with his family. I want my man.</i>

86
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.980
<i>I will talk to them.</i>

87
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.220
Where is Liang Sheng?

88
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.880
She's at home.

89
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.960
Take good care of her.

90
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.150
<i>I'm going to get some water.</i>

91
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.390
He's only interested in making quick bucks. This is retribution.

92
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.010
<i>How it would be? Do we still need to talk about this?</i>

93
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.400
<i>You will definitely be the manager in the future.</i>

94
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.000
Congratulations, Uncle Bei. You will be rich soon.

95
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.940
Jiang Liang Zi is really unlucky.

96
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.410
This is great. He's now crippled.

97
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.400
What are you doing? Why did you step on me?

98
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.830
Let me tell you. I heard that woman is his lover.

99
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.120
What do you think is the relationship between that kid and Jiang Liang Zi?

100
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.650
One, two. One, two.

101
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.610
Older Brother, let's play together.

102
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.590
<i>Older Brother, what are you doing? Are you going out?</i>

103
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.930
<i>Older Brother, where are you going?</i>

104
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.890
I want to go home.

105
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.780
Mom said that this is your home.

106
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.490
Older Brother, what's in your bag?

107
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.180
Can you show me?

108
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.330
Older Brother, what is this?

109
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.970
This is a music score.

110
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.280
What's a music score?

111
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.870
It's for playing piano.

112
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.110
What's a piano?

113
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.560
A piano has lots of white

114
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.400
and black keys.

115
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.200
They produces sound when you press on them.

116
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.630
Older Brother, your shoes are really nice.

117
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.300
What are you doing?

118
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.590
I'm sleeping together with you.

119
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.510
- No need.
- When I'm afraid of the dark,

120
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.130
I would cover my head with the blanket and I won't be afraid anymore.

121
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.690
<i>I'm not afraid of the dark.</i>

122
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.300
<i>You were crying and you still said that you aren't afraid of the dark.</i>

123
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.760
<i>Who's crying?</i>

124
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.630
<i>Weren't you crying just now?</i>

125
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.190
<i>Eat now.</i>

126
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.440
Jiang Sheng, finish your food. I'm going to the hospital.

127
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.670
Eat now.

128
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.020
Thank you, Older Brother.

129
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.170
<i>That was the first time that I felt that my older brother was really nice.</i>

130
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.900
<i>She's coming.</i>

131
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.180
Jiang Sheng.

132
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.900
Look at who this is.

133
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.940
Jiang Sheng, why is he sticking to you?

134
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.610
He's my older brother. He's my  biological older brother. Greet him now.

135
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.520
Biological older brother? Where did he appear from?

136
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.860
I have never seen that you have a biological older brother.

137
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.650
I remember now.

138
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.860
My mom said that he could be your father's illegitimate child.

139
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.220
Bei Xiao Wu, you are talking nonsense.

140
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.890
Did I say the wrong thing?

141
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:37.040
- You don't have the right to say this.
- Why did you hit me?

142
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.960
<i>Bei Xiao Wu, bring it on.</i>

143
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.170
Does it still hurt?

144
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.020
It doesn't. You won and Bei Xiao Wu lost.

145
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.790
<i>How could he do that? Let's look for his mother.</i>

146
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.240
<i>Let's go.</i>

147
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.100
- Where's your mother?
- She's not here.

148
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.360
Who hit him? Did you hit him? Go and hit him now.

149
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.730
Come out here. The both of you, come here.

150
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.570
Hit him now.

151
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.360
- What's wrong, Mother Bei?
- Look at my son.

152
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.890
Look at my son. That wild kid hit him. What's going on? He hit him.

153
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.070
Jiang Sheng, did you hit him?

154
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.020
He will hit others in the future and even kill others. He will also set fire. Isn't that so?

155
00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.390
Why did you hit my son? Why are you crying?

156
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.830
He was beaten by him.

157
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.840
I told you to stay at home and you didn't.

158
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.210
- You insisted on wandering out there.
- What are you doing?

159
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.160
Do you want others to laugh at you? You are really something.

160
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.250
Are you done yet? She's just a kid and you used the feather duster to hit her.

161
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.190
Stop crying. Everything's fine.

162
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.160
Are you going home or not? Go home.

163
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.210
Do you want everyone in the village to notice you? Are you happy now?

164
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.990
Bei Xiao Wu scolded Older Brother. He said that he's a wild kid.

165
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.800
Sorry, it was my fault.

166
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.780
<i>We went to elementary school later.</i>

167
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.250
Liang Sheng! Jiang Sheng!

168
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.840
- What?
- Here.

169
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.740
This is for you.

170
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.010
You don't want this?

171
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.960
That's right. Give it to him.

172
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.220
Sit down. Let me take a look.

173
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.290
Why did you go to the kitchen?

174
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.100
I merely wanted to cook a bowl of noodles for Older Brother.

175
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.010
Does it hurt?

176
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.320
Why are you so careless? Does it hurt?

177
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.450
<i>From that day on,</i>

178
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.620
<i>Actually, I knew that</i>

179
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.350
<i>You didn't want me to cook.</i>

180
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.290
<i>You only knew how to cook noodles.</i>

181
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.430
<i>Thus, Liang Shen,</i>

182
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.220
<i>all those years, the noodles that you cooked for me,</i>

183
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.690
<i>it was your way of doting on me.</i>

184
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.620
Why aren't you eating?

185
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.860
You can have it.

186
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.890
Jiang Sheng, where are you taking me?

187
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.010
Don't open your eyes. You will know later.

188
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.510
<i>Wow.</i>

189
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.350
<i>Older Brother, is this place pretty?</i>

190
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.630
<i>Yes.</i>

191
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.120
We have flower shops there.

192
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.270
You still need to buy flowers? Look, there are so many flowers here and you still need to buy them?

193
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.650
Also, do you know what I like most?

194
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.550
But when I grow up, I want to go to the flower shop too.

195
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.470
Jiang Sheng, you have become much prettier.

196
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.780
Really?

197
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.630
<i>Mom.</i>

198
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.540
<i>Mom.</i>

199
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.590
Mom, these are for you.

200
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.180
For me?

201
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.900
Thank you.

202
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.480
Jiang Sheng has grown up and matured.

203
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.280
Yes.

204
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.350
Yes.

205
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.020
Older Brother.

206
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.500
The stars are falling from the sky.

207
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.700
These are not stars. They are fire flies.

208
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.540
Yes, they are fire flies. I read about them in a book.

209
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:47.380
Older Brother, why do fire flies emit lights?

210
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.450
Because...

211
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.200
I know. It's because its mother is afraid that

212
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.820
it will lose his way. That's why, it places a small light on its back.

213
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.210
Yes.

214
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.990
Older Brother, look.

215
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.100
We should release it.

216
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.370
Why? Can't it go home with us?

217
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.680
Perhaps, its mother is looking for it now.

218
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.680
Fire fly, go home.

219
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.590
Older Brother, I had a dream last night.

220
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.460
The fire fly found its mother.

221
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.550
Really?

222
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.190
<i>Yes.</i>

223
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.860
Jiang Sheng, you are really foolish.

224
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.980
The both of you...

225
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.580
Both of you were born from your mothers.

226
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.350
Understand?

227
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.850
<i>Let's eat.</i>

228
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.110
Where are you going?

229
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.980
Okay.

230
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.220
<i>Go now.</i>

231
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.680
Let's go. Where's your mother?

232
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.690
What is it?

233
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.100
What do you think?

234
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.860
What do you think it is? Your family stole my stuff.

235
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.070
Who stole this?

236
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.080
Tell me who stole this? Hurry up.

237
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.680
- Bei Xiao Wu gave this to me.
- That's right.

238
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.410
What do you mean? You stole this and you are still talking nonsense and lying?

239
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:20.520
What's wrong with you adults? He stole my stuff and he still lied.

240
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.600
- What's wrong?
- Manage your children.

241
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.750
He stole our stuff and he still lied.

242
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.360
Did you steal this? Tell your mother.

243
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.900
Bei Xiao Wu gave this to Older Brother.

244
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.060
It's true.

245
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.820
How could it be like this?  Let's go.

246
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.860
<i>- It was a misunderstanding.
- What do you mean? Let's go.</i>

247
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.040
<i>Let's go home now.</i>

248
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.000
<i>Sorry.</i>

249
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:22.260
<i>What's going on?</i>

250
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.300
Speak!

251
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.290
Bei Xiao Wu gave this to Older Brother.

252
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.210
Manage your daughter.

253
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.310
Here, for you.

254
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.020
Older Brother,  do you want to eat this?

255
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.000
Older Brother, do you want to eat? Just take a bite.

256
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.960
Just eat it. I'm not hungry.

257
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.760
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

258
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.010
I dreamed that I was playing the piano yesterday.

259
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.730
Older Brother, I want to play the piano too.

260
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.180
I will teach you when you are older.

261
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.500
<i>Don't separate them.</i>

262
00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.560
<i>Furthermore, if you separate them,</i>

263
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.900
<i>they will feel the pain.</i>

264
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.050
Really?

265
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.720
I have never seen it

266
00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.400
You are not allowed to say that about my father.
