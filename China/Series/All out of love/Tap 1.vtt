00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.080
- <i>More than 100,000 people have gathered at Tiananmen Square to dance and sing...</i>
- Old Zhang, are you fixing your bike?

22
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.190
The vegetables are not bad today.

23
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.010
<i>This is an exciting time. Starting now,</i>

24
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.610
<i>Hong Kong, the child who has wandered away from its motherland for half a century,</i>

25
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.510
<i>has finally returned to its mother's broad and warm embrace.</i>

26
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.320
<i>This is a solemn moment.</i>

27
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.300
<i>The whole world is watching this.</i>

28
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.740
<i>Four thousand honorable overseas guests</i>

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.170

<i>for the Hong Kong Regime to conduct the handover.</i>

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.290
<i>Everyone is anticipating the return of Hong Kong </i>

32
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.410
<i>- to the embrace of its motherland.</i> 
- Mom, I'm back.

33
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.250
Jiang Sheng, don't touch it. Put it back.

34
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.090
Mom, I want to eat the egg.

35
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.710
You can't.

36
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.520
Mom, let me have a small bite.

37
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.160
<i>You can't. This is for your father.</i>

38
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.610
Dad? Dad definitely won't return, unless it's the new year.

39
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.760
I don't believe he will return.

40
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.620
Your father said that he will come home today.

41
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.850
I don't believe that he will be back. Liar.

42
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.780
Your father is a famous reporter. He's busy with the affairs of the country.

43
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.010
He wouldn't have that much time to keep us company. Eat this.

44
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.590
<i>Jiang Sheng! Jiang Sheng!</i>

45
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.890
<i>Jiang Sheng! Jiang Sheng!</i>

46
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.270
I'm coming.

47
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.120
Quick, we already made an appointment.

48
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.190
Hurry up, Jiang Sheng!

49
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.790
Mom, I'm going to play with Bei Xiaowu first.

50
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.160
You are not going to eat?

51
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.660
You are riding the horse.

52
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.320
Be careful. Dad is making a right turn.

53
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.730
- Right turn. 
- Okay.

54
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.860
Uncle Bei, can you be my horse?

55
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.070
No. My father is my horse. No one else can ride on him.

56
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.750
Who's your horse? You ride on me every day. Let Jiang Sheng ride.

57
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.340
Get off.

58
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.460
- Okay. 
- Come, Jiang Sheng.

59
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.360
Are you ready?

60
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.810
You are riding the horse. We are knocking into them.

61
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.560
Is it fun?

62
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.360
- Yes. 
- It's fun, right?

63
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.520
<i>Doctor, have you seen my family?</i>

64
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.570
<i>Have you seen my family?</i>

65
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.960
<i>Doctor, have you seen my family?</i>

66
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.410
- Nurse, have you seen a person called Jiang Liangzhi?
<i>- We're too busy here. Look somewhere else.</i>

67
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.870
<i>Doctor.</i>

68
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.430
<i>Nurse! Nurse!</i>

69
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.090
<i>Here, quick.</i>

70
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.320
<i>Nurse.</i>

71
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.620
Doctor, have you seen a person called Jiang Liangzhi?

72
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.530
Over there. Go over there and check now.

73
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.480
Have you seen a person called Jiang Liangzhi?

74
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.160
Jiang Liangzhi? Check over there.

75
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.850
Nurse! Is there a person called Jiang Liangzhi?

76
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.630
Look over there.

77
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.270
<i>Doctor.</i>

78
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.970
<i>Doctor.</i>

79
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.790
<i>Doctor, have you seen my family?</i>

80
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.350
<i>That sudden mining disaster</i>

81
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.820
<i>gave my family a big painful blow.</i>

82
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.000
<i>I didn't expect that my childhood would change.</i>

83
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.420
<i>Someone said that my father and a female reporter from the provincial capital came here to conduct an interview.</i>

84
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.000
<i>This kid also traveled here with them.</i>

85
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.530
<i>Who's he? How is he related to my father?</i>

86
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.380
<i>My mother didn't say anything. They simply walked in silence.</i>

87
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.640
One, two, one.

88
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.320
One, two, one.

89
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.120
One, two, one. One, two, one.

90
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.220
Mom.

91
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.950
Jiang Sheng, call him "Older Brother" in the future.

92
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.400
Greet him.

93
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.060
I don't have an older brother.

94
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.720
He's your biological older brother in the future. Address him as your "Older Brother."

95
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.920
Older Brother.

96
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.990
<i>Just like this, Liangsheng suddenly came into my world.</i>

97
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.280
<i>Four years old was a hazy age.</i>

98
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.280
<i>All I saw was mud, grass, and green bristlegrass.</i>

99
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.610
Older Brother, what's in your bag?

100
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:43.530
<i>As if a sacred life was hard to go against. At age four,</i>

101
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.570
<i>I unavoidably met the six-year-old Liangsheng.</i>

102
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.550
<i>I couldn't and also didn't know how to ask</i>

103
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.750
<i>why this boy called Liangsheng suddenly came to our home.</i>

104
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.060
<i>It was already determined that he's my older brother,</i>

105
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.620
<i>and I am his younger sister.</i>

106
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.530
Older Brother, are you crying?  Are you afraid of the dark?

107
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:58.340
If you are afraid, I'm not. I will keep you company.

108
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.540
Come and eat. Sit over there.

109
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.540
Eat.

110
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.050
That's right, we should look for him. We have elders and children at home.

111
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.790
<i>Village Head, take a look. Ever since they came, we haven't had any good days.</i>

112
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.090
<i>Enough.</i>

113
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.970
Liangsheng, take your younger sister into the house now.

114
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.310
- It's her! She's the troublemaker!
- That's right. If your husband Jiang Liangzhi

115
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.350
didn't pull that woman into the mine, would this major incident have happened?

116
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:35.820
Return my husband to me. That's right. It's your family.

117
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.310
He's the pillar of the family.

118
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:42.590
How do you expect the elders and children in my family to survive in the future?

119
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.950
He has already received retribution and he's now even dragging along the villagers with him.

120
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.600
I'm not leaving. I'm very sad. I want to settle a score with his family. I want my husband.

121
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.980
I will talk to them.

122
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.220
Where is Liangsheng?

123
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.880
He's at home.

124
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.960
Take good care of him.

125
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.150
I'm going to get some water.

126
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.210
Uncle Bei, the miners violated the operational procedures. Director Yang has never been bothered by it.

127
00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:01.390
He's only interested in making quick bucks for himself. This is retribution.

128
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:06.390
There will be a new open bidding for the minerals. We don't know what will happen in the future.

129
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.010
What will happen? Isn't it obvious?

130
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.400
You will definitely be the manager in the future.

131
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.000
Congratulations, Uncle Bei. You will be rich soon.

132
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:26.350
Uncle Bei, in the future, if you rise quickly in your position, you must take care of me.

133
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.520
It's not in my fortune yet.

134
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.150
Director Yang is now under the control of the police.

135
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.270
I received the notice that I need to assist the relevant departments to conduct mine compensations.

136
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.060
As for the aid for the disaster victims, you handle it.

137
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.870
No problem. Just direct me and I will do it.

138
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.940
Jiang Liangzhi is really unlucky. They gave him such a great scoop,

139
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.780
and he had to encounter an accident.

140
00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.410
Look at him now. He's now crippled.

141
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.620
I heard that the female reporter who came with him wasn't able to be rescued by the capital's hospital.

142
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.220
She just died.

143
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.400
What are you doing? Why did you step on me?

144
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.830
Let me tell you. I heard that woman is his lover.

145
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.820
- Let's go. 
- You really stepped on me.

146
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.120
What do you think is the relationship between that kid and Jiang Liangzi?

147
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.650
One, two. One, two.

148
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.610
Older Brother, let's play together.

149
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.590
Older Brother, what are you doing? Are you going out?

150
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.930
Older Brother, where are you going?

151
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.890
I want to go home.

152
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.780
Mom said that this is your home.

153
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.490
Older Brother, what's in your bag?

154
00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.180
Can you show me?

155
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.330
Older Brother, what is this?

156
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.970
This is a music score.

157
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.280
What's a music score?

158
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.870
It's for playing the piano.

159
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.110
What's a piano?

160
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.560
A piano has lots of white

161
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.400
and black keys.

162
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.200
They produce sound when you press on them.

163
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.630
Older Brother, your shoes are really nice.

164
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.300
What are you doing?

165
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.590
I'm sleeping together with you.

166
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.510
- No need. 
- Whenever I'm afraid of the dark,

167
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.130
I would cover my head with the blanket and I won't be afraid anymore.

168
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.690
I'm not afraid of the dark.

169
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.300
You were crying and you still said that you aren't afraid of the dark.

170
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.760
I didn't cry.

171
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.630
Weren't you crying just now?

172
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:44.150
Older Brother, do you want to go play hopscotch with me tomorrow?

173
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.190
Hurry up and eat.

174
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.440
Jiang Sheng, finish your food. I'm going to the hospital.

175
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.920
I'm going to see your dad. I'll come back later, don't go running out.

176
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.670
Eat now.

177
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.670
<i>After the accident,</i>

178
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:15.830
<i>the pension from the publisher of the newspaper was used entirely on treating father's injury.</i>

179
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:22.480
<i>Mother had no choice but to take over Father's position of taking care of the household. The days became long and hard.</i>

180
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.020
Thank you, Older Brother.

181
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.530
<i>That day, Liangsheng gave me the first bite of the braised meat,</i>

182
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.240
<i>satisfying a little girl's greatest desire at the time.</i>

183
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.170
<i>That was the first time I felt that having an older brother was really great.</i>

184
00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.900
She's coming.

185
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.180
Hey, Jiang Sheng.

186
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.900
Look at who this is.

187
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.940
Jiang Sheng, why is he always following you around?

188
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.610
He's my brother. He's my biological older brother. Greet him now.

189
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.520
Biological older brother? Where did he appear from?

190
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.860
I have never seen that you had a biological older brother.

191
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.650
Aiyo! I remember now.

192
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.860
My mom said that he could be your father's illegitimate child.

193
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.220
Bei Xiaowu, you are talking nonsense.

194
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.890
Did I say the wrong thing?

195
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:37.040
- You don't have the right to say this. 
- Why did you hit me?

196
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.960
Bei Xiaowu, go!

197
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.170
Does it still hurt?

198
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:50.020
Brother, you won and Bei Xiaowu lost.

199
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.790
Why are you not similar to me at all? Let's look for his mother.

200
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.240
Let's go.

201
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.100
- Where's your mother? 
- She's not here.

202
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.360
Who hit him? Did you hit him? Go and hit him now.

203
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.730
Come out here. The both of you, come here.

204
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.570
Hit him now.

205
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.360
- What's wrong, Mrs. Bei? 
- Look at my son.

206
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.890
Look at my son. That wild kid hit him. What's going on? He hit him.

207
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.070
Jiang Sheng, did you hit him?

208
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.820
Look at how twisted this wild kid is. You must teach him a lesson!

209
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.020
He will hit others in the future and even kill others. He will also set fire. Isn't that so?

210
00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.390
Why did you hit my son? Why are you crying?

211
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.830
Look at what he did.

212
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.840
I told you to stay at home and you didn't.

213
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.210
- You insisted on wandering out there. 
- What are you doing?

214
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.160
- Do you want others to laugh at you? 
- Enough!

215
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.250
Are you done yet? She's just a kid and you used the feather duster to hit her.

216
00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.190
Stop crying. Everything's fine.

217
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.820
Go home now. You are the troublemaker.

218
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.160
Are you going home or not? Go home.

219
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.200
<i>Why do you keep getting into trouble?</i>

220
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.210
Do you want everyone in the village to notice you before you are happy?

221
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.990
That's not it. Bei Xiaowu said that Older Brother is a wild kid.

222
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.390
<i>That mining disaster left a heartache in the Weijiaping people.</i>

223
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.890
<i>Everyone said that Liangsheng is a wild kid.</i>

224
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.030
<i>In my young age, I didn't yet understand</i>

225
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:41.400
<i> what those words meant to Liangsheng.</i>

226
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.800
Sorry, it was all my fault.

227
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.280
If you have to suffer because of me again,

228
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.820
I'll let the moon in the sky crush me.

229
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.500
Brother, you shouldn't let the moon crush you.

230
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.800
If one day I am suffering, you should use braised pork to crush me.

231
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.780
<i>We went to elementary school later.</i>

232
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.980
<i>The teacher wanted everyone to talk about their dreams.</i>

233
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.460
<i>The children of Weijiaping</i>

234
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.720
<i>either wanted to be scientists or astronauts.</i>

235
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.460
<i>Only Liangsheng foolishly stood up and said...</i>

236
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.540
<i>My dream is to become a chef who knows how to cook braised pork.</i>

237
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.250
Jiang Sheng! Liangsheng!

238
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.840
- What? 
- Here.

239
00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.910
- What is this?
- A clay pot!

240
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.360
It's our Bei family's heirloom.

241
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.740
This is for you.

242
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.140
What is this used for?

243
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:13.510
Last time, I caused you to get beaten, and I felt bad. Take this as a gift.

244
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.650
If I get beaten, that's that. I'm not taking it.

245
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.010
You don't want this?

246
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.960
That's right. Give it to him.

247
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.910
I'm giving this to you. You defeated me the last time.

248
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.700
You're Weijiaping's overlord. Take this as tribute to the overlord.

249
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.970
I'll give this to you! Take care of it! Don't drop it! Don't lose it!

250
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.200
It's a gift from me!

251
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.220
Sit down. Let me take a look.

252
00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.290
Why did you go to the kitchen?

253
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.100
I merely wanted to cook a bowl of noodles for Older Brother.

254
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.010
Does it hurt?

255
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.320
Why were you so careless? Does it hurt?

256
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.450
<i>From that day on,</i>

257
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.500
<i>Liangsheng never let me touch the stove again.</i>

258
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.620
<i>Actually, I knew that</i>

259
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.090
<i>you have always remembered the large bump on my head</i>

260
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.740
<i>and the tears I shed as I tugged on the hem of your shirt.</i>

261
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.350
<i>You didn't want me to cook,</i>

262
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.290
<i>and you only knew how to cook noodles.</i>

263
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.430
<i>Thus, Liangsheng,</i>

264
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.220
<i>all those years, the plain noodles that you cooked for me</i>

265
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.690
<i>was your way of doting on me.</i>

266
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.620
Why aren't you eating?

267
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.860
You can have it.

268
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.890
Jiang Sheng, where are you taking me?

269
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.010
Don't open your eyes. You will know later.

270
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.510
Wow.

271
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.350
Older Brother, is this place pretty?

272
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.630
Yes.

273
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:19.750
Older Brother, this is the prettiest place in Weijiaping.

274
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.840
Older Brother, are there flowers in your city?

275
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.120
We have flower shops there.

276
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.270
You need to buy flowers? Look, there are so many flowers here and you still need to buy them?

277
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.650
Also, do you know what I like most?

278
00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.100
Braised pork?

279
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.340
Other than braised pork, I love flowers the most.

280
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.550
But when I grow up, I want to open up a flower shop, too.

281
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.010
Finished.

282
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.470
Jiang Sheng, you have become much prettier.

283
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.780
Really?

284
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.630
Mom!

285
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.360
Slow down.

286
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.540
Mom!

287
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.590
Mom, these are for you.

288
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.180
For me?

289
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.900
Thank you.

290
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.480
Jiang Sheng, you have grown up and matured.

291
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.480
I will put these here for now.

292
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.280
Okay.

293
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.020
I also want to gift these flowers to my mom.

294
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.820
Do you want to go see the mine?

295
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.350
Yes.

296
00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.670
The mine isn't a place for kids.

297
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.110
<i>[No entry to the former mine]</i>

298
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.020
Older Brother,

299
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.500
the stars are falling from the sky.

300
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.700
These are not stars. They are fireflies.

301
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.330
Flies? Flies know how to shine light?

302
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.540
Yes, they are fireflies. I read about them in a book.

303
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:47.380
Older Brother, why do fireflies emit lights?

304
00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.450
Because...

305
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.200
I know. It's because the fireflies' mothers are afraid that

306
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:56.820
they will lose their way. That's why they placed small lights on their backs.

307
00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.210
Yes.

308
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.990
Older Brother, look.

309
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.100
We should release it.

310
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:31.370
Why? Can't it go home with us?

311
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.680
Perhaps, its mother is looking for it now.

312
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.680
Firefly, go home.

313
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.590
Older Brother, I had a dream last night.

314
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.460
The firefly found its mother.

315
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.550
Really?

316
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.190
Yes.

317
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.610
Older Brother, will this one become a cricket?

318
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.990
I don't trust Bei Xiaowu.

319
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.860
Jiang Sheng, you are really foolish.

320
00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.970
Crickets are born from cricket mothers.

321
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.840
Ginger can only be born from gingers.

322
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.780
Then, Liangsheng can only come from

323
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.710
Liangsheng's mom. Right?

324
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:59.560
- My mom... 
- What about your mom?  How come we haven't found her yet?

325
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.980
The both of you...

326
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.580
Remember that I gave birth to the both of you.

327
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.350
Understand?

328
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.850
Let's go eat downstairs.

329
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.110
Where is Liangsheng?

330
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.590
He's out playing in the garden.

331
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.210
- Xin Ru. 
 - What?

332
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.860
Go fill out the adoption paperwork for Liangsheng.

333
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.980
Okay.

334
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.570
- Mom! 
- Are you going or not? If you don't, I'm going to beat you to death.

335
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.220
- Do you believe me? Go!
- I won't go!

336
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:35.680
Let's go. Where's your mother?

337
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.690
What is it?

338
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.100
What do you think?

339
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.860
What do you think it is? Your kids stole stuff from my house.

340
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.070
Who stole this?

341
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:05.080
Tell me who stole this? Come here, come here.

342
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.680
- Bei Xiaowu gave this to me. 
- That's right.

343
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:12.410
What do you mean? You stole this, yet you are still talking nonsense and lying?

344
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.490
No one can control you two, right?

345
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:20.520
What's wrong with you adults? He stole my stuff and he still lied.

346
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.600
- What's wrong? 
- Hey, you're back. Manage your children.

347
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.750
He stole our stuff and he still lied.

348
00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.360
Did you steal this? Tell your mother.

349
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.900
Bei Xiaowu gave this to Older Brother as a gift.

350
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.060
It's true.

351
00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.830
What do you mean "it's true?" You steal stuff from your own house and give to someone else?

352
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.820
How could it be like this?  Let's go.

353
00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.860
- I think it was a misunderstanding, Mrs. Bei. 
- What do you mean? Let's go.

354
00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.040
Let's go home now. Are you going home or not?

355
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.820
- Home, let's go. 
 - Give it to me.

356
00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:46.760
What are you doing? Look at him, he's stealing again. Is this even yours?

357
00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.830
Does it belong to your family?

358
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.290
Here, take it!

359
00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:01.760
- What do you think you're doing? 
 - How could she do that?!  Look, did you see that?

360
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.170
Do you see this? These are the children you raised!

361
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.030
Tell her you're sorry.

362
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.480
Robbers! Are you okay? Your family is filled with robbers.

363
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.330
Why don't you take more? Sorry, Mrs. Bei.

364
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.730
Robbers! Let's go home.

365
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:18.000
Sorry!

366
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:22.260
What's going on?

367
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.300
Speak!

368
00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:33.130
Jiang Sheng, tell me the truth. Did you steal something?

369
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:35.290
Bei Xiaowu gave this to Older Brother. It's true.

370
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.720
Tell the truth.

371
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.210
Control your daughter.

372
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.160
Liangsheng!

373
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.030
Are you okay?

374
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:24.940
Jiang Sheng, come and eat.

375
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.210
Give it to Liangsheng.

376
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.580
Give it to Liangsheng.

377
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.820
Mom, I want to eat a poached egg, too.

378
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.600
I'll make one for you tomorrow.

379
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.560
Go feed your dad, Jiang Sheng.

380
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.780
I'll do it.

381
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.310
Here, for you.

382
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.010
A poached egg?

383
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:13.020
Older Brother,  do you want to eat this?

384
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.600
No, I already ate. You go ahead.

385
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.820
What is that sound?

386
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.000
Older Brother, do you want to eat? Just take a bite.

387
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.960
You eat it. I don't need it.

388
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.620
Brother, what song are you singing?

389
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.440
“On Wings of Song.”

390
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.060
- Songs have wings, too? 
 - They do.

391
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:56.780
If you have songs, they can take you anywhere you want.

392
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.760
- Really? 
- Yes.

393
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.970
Older Brother, the song you were singing sounded so good.

394
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.010
Yesterday, I dreamed that I was playing the piano.

395
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.770
The song I was playing was that one.

396
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.730
Older Brother, I want to play the piano, too.

397
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.180
I will teach you when you are older.

398
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.210
- Mushrooms! 
 - Don't pick them.

399
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:24.410
Why?

400
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.990
It's great that the two of them are together.

401
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.500
Don't separate them.

402
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:36.280
Why can't I pick them? Mushrooms are so tasty.

403
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:41.240
Look, there's a big mushroom and a little mushroom, nestled close together.

404
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.460
It means they're one. One can't live without the other.

405
00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.560
If you forcibly separate them,

406
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.900
they will suffer a lot of pain.

407
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.050
Really?

408
00:39:56.050 --> 00:40:00.360
Then. we'll leave the big mushroom and the little mushroom

409
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.570
together and never separate them. Okay?

410
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.460
"Just before his departure, she sews stitch by stitch."

411
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:24.710
"Worrying about his late return."

412
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.030
"Worrying about his late return."

413
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.490
"Who would say that an inch-tall grass..."

414
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.960
"Who would say that an inch-tall grass..."

415
00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.710
"Can repay the warmth of the three spring months?"

416
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.590
"Can repay the warmth of the three spring months?"

417
00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.650
"Startled by magpies leaving the branch in moonlight,

418
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:09.300
I hear cicadas shrill in the breeze at midnight.

419
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.750
The ricefields’ sweet smell promises a bumper year;

420
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.580
Listen, how frogs’ croaks please the ear!

421
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.340
Beyond the clouds seven or eight stars twinkle;

422
00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.220
Before the hills two or three raindrops sprinkle.

423
00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:25.560
There is an inn beside the village temple."

424
00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:37.100
Jiang Sheng, don't touch it.

425
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.710
If you ruin them, we won't get to see the ginger lily.

426
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.550
Older Brother, are ginger lilies pretty?

427
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.720
I have never seen them

428
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.600
but they have to be prettier than you.

429
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:15.000
<i> Subtitles brought to you by the Never Sad Team @ Viki</i>

430
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.100
Something big's happened!

431
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.220
He Manhou is making trouble at your house.

432
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.280
Everyone look!

433
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:44.130
Since this child came to our village, has this village had peace and quiet? Look at him.

434
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.030
His clothing is so refined. Does he look like one of us?

435
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.120
We're all just decent village people.

436
00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.930
Because Jiang Liangzhi was messing around outside, you were born.

437
00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.400
You are not allowed to say that about my father.

438
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.830
It's you who's the dirty one.

439
00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.710

440
