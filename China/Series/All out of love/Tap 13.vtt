00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.040
<i>Episode 13</i>

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.570
Your biological mother, her name is Cheng Qing.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.750
And you have a grandfather.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.800
His name is Cheng Fangzheng. Your family is a big extended family.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.690
Your father...

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.610
Mother.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.710
<i> When mother left us that night,</i>

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.300
<i>My brother and I were silent for a long period of time.</i>

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.430
<i>I told myself that she has fallen asleep.</i>

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.840
<i>When dawn is here, mother will wake up.</i>

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.020
<i>She will call me, Jiang Sheng, look at me and smile.</i>

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.190
<i>But until I saw our family portrait on the table,</i>

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.490
<i>I could no longer hold my tears back from falling.</i>

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.500
<i>I understand.  My mother is gone.</i>

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.970
<i>She will never come back.</i>

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.740
<i>I wish so much to lie in her arms again. And be spoiled by her one more time.</i>

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.590
<i>And say to her, Mother, I miss you.</i>

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.770
<i>Mother's last wish is to be buried together with Father.</i>

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.670
<i>Mother's whole life has been ordinary.</i>

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.290
<i>Just like her final wish. Plain and unadorned.</i>

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.260
<i>Her head full of white hair, and her hands that are callused from work, supported this family.</i>

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.360
<i>Mother, your tenacity, selflessness, and tolerance, </i>

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.770
<i>Is as tender as the great earth.</i>

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.160
<i>In the years and months to come, it will enfolds me, and nourishes me.</i>

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.260
<i>Helps me to mature. Allows  me be courageous.</i>

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.230
Tianyou. I've checked the hospital birth records of her late aunt's baby.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.600
The child is her biological child. He's not adopted.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.090
And she has a colleague at the newspaper office by the name of Jiang Liangzhi.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.910
They had a very close relationship. I think this person will definitely know the whereabouts of the child.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.170
Jiang Liangzhi.. he's in  Weijiaping.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.500
You're certain you gave me the correct address?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.080
Old Wang.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.000
When will my brother be coming back?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.250
Can you check for me again.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.980
What is Jiang Sheng's work and rest schedule and itinerary.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.950
The more detailed the better.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.590
Okay. I'll get it to you quickly.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.440
Which of these stars in the sky

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.250
is Mother? And which is Father?

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.610
I feel that you are thinking too much.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.890
If according to you,  there will be one more star in the sky when someone passes.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.050
Then I'm afraid the sky above us is not big enough.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.220
If really when someone leaves us,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.560
And become a star in the sky, it is also a good thing.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.130
We can see it when we lift our heads.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.790
The two of you, please don't be so sad.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.140
Be more realistic, okay?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.840
Liangsheng.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.210
The two of you.. are not from the same mother. Is that right?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.620
I was ignorant when I was young. And mocked you constantly for being a motherless wild child.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.920
You.. please don't mind what I said.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.700
Today, in front of Jiang Sheng,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.470
Apologize to you sincerely. I'm wrong.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.590
This was a long time ago. Why do you still talk about it?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.000
Bei Xiaowu. My mother said to me that both my brother and I are her children.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.300
And you too. Even though mother is no longer here with us.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.000
But we must encourage one another. And live our lives well in future.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.760
Tianyou has suddenly returned from overseas.
Separately, one after another, he and Jiang Sheng have gone to Weijiaping.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.900
But I don't know what they where doing there.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.770
But, up till now, they have not seen each other yet.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.610
A good show is starting soon.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.810
No matter what happens tomorrow, you must stand by me.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.810
What about the Old Master..
If Grandfather is going to find someone to blame,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.600
I will talk to him about it. You'll see who he will give his support to then.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.530
Brother. You're back.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.230
Right. I'm back to rest for a couple of days.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.870
You.. are going out?
Arh.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:05.410
I'm going out to meet my girlfriend. Will you accompany me?

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.600
Is that the girlfriend whom you mentioned to me previously? She's here?

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.370
Yes. Brother, please don't make fun of me.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.450
I think she wants to break off with me. I don't know what to do.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.050
So I hope that you will go with me and help me.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.370
Okay. There's no problem.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.390
Hello, Brother. I'm downstairs now.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.760
When are you coming down.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.110
Okay. Please hurry.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.130
Our family and Yuhua are too fated.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.130
So your girlfriend is here too.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.000
Yes, brother.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.760
Wait. I see a friend of mine. I'll go say hello to her.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.260
Oh.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.260
Jiang Sheng.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.020
Hey, Uncle.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.700
Long time no see.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.530
You're back from your business trip?

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.500
- I'm with my brother...
 - Jiang Sheng.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.570
You...you two know each other?

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:32.480
Yes, brother, she's the girlfriend I wanted to introduce you to.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.590
What are you saying?

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.690
What's the matter?

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:42.800
Brother, isn't Jiang Sheng beautiful?

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.000
What nonsense are you saying? Whose your girlfriend?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.300
Jiang Sheng, what's the matter?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.540
Your hand still has the mark I left on it.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.810
<i>We agreed to be together forever. </i>

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.070
Tianen, cut it out. Let's go back.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.630
Even you won't believe me, brother?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.030
I know that none of you cares whether I live or die. Ever since I was young, I've had no legs, so no one trusts me.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.030
What are you saying?

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.870
Jiang Sheng,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.840
how come you suddenly have a change of heart?

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.430
Didn't we agree to be together forever?

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.740
I know already. You are disgusted with me.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.060
Disgusted that I don't have legs and cannot stand. Am I right?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.620
I just knew that you are disgusted with me!

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.940
What are you doing, Tianen? Calm down.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:56.600
Calm down, okay? Calm down. I will handle everything, okay?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.680
Cheng Tianen, what crazy fit are you into?

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.840
Tianyou, you really believe him?

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.150
Brother, do you believe me or her?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.430
Jiang Sheng, sorry.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.750
Brother,

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.150
you don't believe me, am I right?

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.220
Old Wang, take Tianen home first.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:05.070
Brother, I also don't know why a thing like that happened. Stop being mad.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:12.240
I'm not mad. I'm just worried about you, afraid that he'll bully you again.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.940
Do you know that Cheng Tianen?

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:20.290
I know Cheng Tianyou, but I'm not that familiar with Cheng Tianen.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.440
Is Cheng Tianyou that man who drove you back to school last time?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.760
Yes.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:34.030
I don't care who the other party is, from where he came from, what kind of person he is,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.040
but he can't bully you.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.450
Jiang Sheng, when mother left, I promised her that I will take good care of you,

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:46.740
that I'm going to take responsibility for you. The eldest brother is like a father. I don't care what kind of person you meet in the future.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.340
No matter who he is, as long as he's good to you and will take responsibility for you,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:56.630
I will walk you down the aisle in behalf of father and personally hand you to him.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.680
Brother.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.980
Sorry.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.410
Did I disappoint you?

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:23.070
There's nothing to apologize. It's me who didn't protect you well.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.740
Since we were little, you doted me the most.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.990
You gave the only fried egg in your bowl to me.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:36.380
When there was a field trip in our school, you saved money to buy me a new pair of shoes.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:42.540
When I said that I love eating persimmons, you carved my name on all the persimmon trees.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:48.290
Brother, I miss our parents.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.370
I miss that last new year's eve we had together.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.060
The four of us eating a reunion meal.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.210
And then you stayed on the rooftop with me to wait for midnight.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.120
It suddenly started snowing.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.510
You even wrote my name on the snow.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.400
I also miss our parents a lot.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:30.640
but don't worry, wherever I am, that is your home.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.810
I promise you that I will take you to see the snow again next winter.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.740
And I will still write our names on the snow.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.740
Brother, help me tell Jiang Sheng to not have a change of heart.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.930
Brother, you will help me, right?

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.410
I don't know why you did it,

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.460
but don't look for her from now on.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.080
You care about her?

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.020
The one I cared about is you.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.110
This matter ends here.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.120
Please come again.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.140
Welcome—

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.030
Jiang Sheng...

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.050
I want to—

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.030
Are you buying flowers? If not, leave.

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.030
Sorry.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.480
Why are you apologizing? It wasn't your fault.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.560
I know. Tianen sometimes indeed can go overboard.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.320
What? This matter for you is just going overboard?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.630
Also, do you really believe him?

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.170
No... He was at fault here.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.620
I came to apologize in his behalf.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.320
Cheng Tianyou,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.660
you disappeared for several months. Upon your return, something like this happened.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.070
Okay already. From now on, let's stop seeing each other.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.210
These past months—

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.390
I didn't contact you these past months

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:32.110
because I wanted to seriously think about our relationship.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.480
Your life is more simple,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:41.130
while mine is complicated. I was worried that I might bring you trouble and problems.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.040
But I've figured it out. Jiang Sheng, there is something that I want to tell you.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.510
Enough. Don't say it anymore.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.940
We're not friends from now on.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.020
<i>The future of the Cheng family can only rely on you.</i>

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.860
<i>Tianen surely can't be depended on anymore.</i>

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.450
<i>Look at him,</i>

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.540
<i>he can't even take good care of himself.</i>

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.280
<i>I don't know why you did it,</i>

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.220
<i>but don't look for her from now on.</i>

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.920
<i>You care about her?</i>

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.890
<i>The person I cared about is you.</i>

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.630
Jiang Sheng, come and have breakfast.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.720
I love eating your breakfast the most. What am I going to do if one day I don't get to eat it anymore?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.430
Why would that happen? As long as you like it, I can make it for you everyday.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.470
I'll get a Yakult for you.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.050
Why do I feel like ever since you returned from Weijiaping, you like to eat a lot?

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.670
There are so many good things to eat. Here.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.840
There's so much stuff in the fridge. Aren't you afraid it'll go bad?

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.410
Of course they won't go bad. With you around, they won't go bad.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.720
Also, Bei Xiaowu specially bought this TCL large-capacity fridge. It's not a problem.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.290
What's your schedule for today?

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:17.100
I don't have a class in the afternoon, so I'm going to help out at the flower shop.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.860
How has the flower shop been recently?

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.190
Pretty good.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.570
That's good. Eat up.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.880
Hello? Tianyou.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.450
Tianen went out early this morning.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.520
Where did he go?

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.890
<i>I don't know. I'll ask for you.</i>

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.760
Oh yeah. There's been a new development in your Aunt's case.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.910
Her son is named Liangsheng.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.150
Liangsheng?

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.710
Where is Liangsheng right now?

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.860
He's at Yuhua University.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.390
All right. I got it.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.350
Find out where Tianen went.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.380
<i>All right.</i>

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.770
- Qian Zhi.
- Hey, Tianyou. It's bad. Tianen has gone to Jiangsheng's flower shop.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.920
<i>Okay. See if you like this.</i>

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.080
<i>Please sign this for me.</i>

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.200
Okay.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:33.190
Jiang Sheng, is that man outside your friend?

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.260
He's already been waiting for two hours. Go see him.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:45.300
I'm sorry, Madam. I'll speak with him.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:56.050
Cheng Tianen, what exactly is your objective? You guarding the door like this will affect the other customers.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:02.090
I don't have an objective. I just missed you, so I came to see you.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.610
Leave right now. If you don't, I'll call the police.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.690
Ms. Jiang, don't be too hasty. This won't be good for anyone.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.570
Give it. Give it to me. You-!

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.400
- Ms. Jiang. Ms. Jiang, calm down.
- Cheng Tianen, I'm not your enemy.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.050
- We don't have any bad intentions. Ms. Jiang!
- Give me my cell phone. Give it back!

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.770
Cheng Tianen, stop pestering me!

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.970
- Ms. Jiang.
- What do you want? Give it back.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.710
What you are doing?

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.770
Why is it you guys again?

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.240
Why are all the people around Jiang Sheng so boorish like you?

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.290
Birds of a feather flock together.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:53.130
Watch your words. Do you think I won't hit you?

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.950
- You wanna have a go?
- Xiaowu! Watch your words!

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.670
Xiaowu, let go!

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.300
Hello. 110?

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.780
- Is this confirmed?
- It's confirmed. Liangsheng is your Aunt's son.

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.820
You...Inform grandfather right away.

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.650
But don't let him know that Liangsheng has been hurt.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.870
Good.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:24.060
Jiang Sheng. I...wish to tell you-

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.500
Leave. I don't wish to you see again.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.620
I have to stay too.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.180
Because...

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:43.480
Because Liangsheng is also family to me.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.370
Family?

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.640
<i>Cheng Tianyou, leave right now. I don't want to see you again.</i>

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.350
You misunderstand. I just found out myself.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:58.860
Liangsheng's biological mother was my Aunt.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.790
A while ago, among the things my Aunt left behind,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:17.340
I found an ultrasound scan. So I suspected that my Aunt had a child before she died.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:23.540
After an investigation, we actually found her birth records at the hospital.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.890
And that child was in Weijiaping.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.930
Yes, my brother was born in Weijiaping, but he's my brother. He has nothing to do with the Cheng family.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.290
I know that you can't accept this right now.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.590
Who is the family of the patient?

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.700
<i>I am.</i>

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.360
The situation is like this.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.940
Althought we performed an emergency operation, the death rate is still fifteen to thirty percent.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.440
You must prepare yourselves.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.090
Go. I don't want to see you again.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:35.320
Also, don't approach Jiang Sheng again. Otherwise, I'll make  you regret it.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.900
Brother, how is Liangsheng?

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.930
He has been transferred to a normal room. He most likely has stabilized.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.280
I was worried about him, so I came to visit him.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.460
I know I was wrong. I didn't mean to do it.

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.810
Why are you here?

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.430
I just came to visit him.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.440
Liangsheng doesn't need your visit.

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:30.450
Sorry. I know I was wrong.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.770
I also never thought that things will escalate to like this.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.880
He is your brother, but he also is my cousin.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.080
I only wanted to make a joke, but I didn't expect it will end up like this.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.020
Please leave.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.450
And you, leave too.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.440
It's not easy for my brother to be better now. He needs to quietly recuperate.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.190
Jiang Sheng.

00:34:54.950 --> 00:35:00.360
Calm down a little. I'm really sorry for things to have progressed to like this,

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.420
but can you allow me to stay and be with him?

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.510
I can take care of my brother.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.860
You all leave now. Don't come back.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.730
Xiao Qing's child got hurt and hospitalized. Tianyou actually hid such a huge matter from me?

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:25.550
Master, don't get mad. Isn't it Tianyou is just worried that your health won't be able to bear it.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.220
But that is my grandson!

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.290
His facial features...

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.290
...are indeed very similar to Xiao Qing.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.220
Who's that person outside?

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.380
Liangsheng's little sister.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.450
The Jiang family can be counted as our benefactor.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:13.840
Later, make the arrangements.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.530
I understand.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.620
What are you trying to do?

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.320
Grandpa already knew that we found aunt's son.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.470
No one was able to stop him and he immediately flew back from Hong Kong.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:53.880
Now that Liangsheng got hurt, he's feeling happiness and sadness at the same time. It is quite traumatizing to him.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:00.460
Tianyou.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:07.150
Grandpa said that after you've handled the matters here, immediately go back to the Cheng Manor.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.000
I got it.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.800
I'll get going now.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.570
How did Liangsheng get hurt?

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.360
I heard that it has something to do with Tianen.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.270
There's no point dwelling on that.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.770
What's important now is how to cure Liangsheng.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.150
That child Tianen...

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.230
These past years, we've spoiled him too much.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.040
It has gone overboard.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.840
Grandpa, I will discipline Tianen.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.720
For him to commit  such a huge mistake, I also am responsible.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.990
Since this child is back, he is now a member of the Cheng family from now on.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.530
Based on our ancestral genealogy, he should be called Cheng Tiance.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.110
Tianyou, once the condition of Liangsheng stabilizes,

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.320
let him come back to acknowledge his roots.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:30.030
I want him to return to the Cheng family

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.660
and let all our friends and relatives know

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.770
that we have an additional grandchild.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.550
Flourishing branches and abundant leaves, full of descendants.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:49.630
Grandpa, he has gotten used to the identity of Jiang Liangsheng for so many years.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.930
If we suddenly recognize him as our family,

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:55.920
Liangsheng and his family might not be able to easily accept it.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.440
Our Cheng family is a respectable and renowned family. Why would it be hard for him to accept us?

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.200
Liangsheng is the child of Cheng Qing.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.980
He must return to the Cheng family sooner or later. A water has a source,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.660
a tree has roots. A person must not forget his origin.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.280
Tianyou,

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.740
do you feel that old Master is being a bit unreasonable?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.570
For so many years, Grandpa has been missing Auntie. Now that he finally found her son,

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:42.330
he surely wishes to have a happy life with him. I can understand that.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.700
But...standing in the point of view of Liangsheng,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.530
the Jiang family still have raised him for so many years. He owed them a lot.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:55.270
How could he accept being suddenly called Cheng Tiance?

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:01.210
I'm worried that Grandpa is being too hurried and he might just get disappointed.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.440
Planning ahead

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.490
and thoroughly considering all aspects are your good traits.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.790
But Tianyou, in this matter,

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:14.100
don't look at it as being too complicated.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:20.260
No matter what, finding your cousin is a happy matter.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.720
Regardless if he's called Jiang Liangsheng or Cheng Tiance,

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.230
those are just vulgar names.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.130
What's important is the person, Liangsheng.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.830
Once he has been acknowledged as a member of the Cheng family,

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.890
you think old Master can bear to not intervene?

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.560
I understand.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:48.080
The Jiang parents are now gone,

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:53.260
but Liangsheng still has a little sister. The two of them are relying on each to live.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.740
We can't disregard their feelings.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.420
Brother, you're awake.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.200
Are you alright?

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:53.470
Jiang Sheng, I made a very long dream.

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.980
I dreamed our parents telling me

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.930
to take good care of you.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:06.490
Also, they said  that we shouldn't separate or abandon each other in this life.

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.830
Okay.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.200
We won't separate or abandon each other.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.630
I also dreamed that you kept crying. I said,

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.740
"Why are you crying?"

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.340
What? You were really crying?

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.830
Don't worry. I'm fine.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:48.120
♫ <i>The season of my heart depends on your sad or joyful look</i> ♫

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:55.130
♫ <i>How beautiful the poetry is in the chaos and bitterness I feel for you</i> ♫
