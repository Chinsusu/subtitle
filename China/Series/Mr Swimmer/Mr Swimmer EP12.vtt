00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
How about this one

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.560
Why don't you use their Soup

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.920
It tastes bad

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.456
It's full of monosodium gluatemate

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.080
And I like soup

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.360
How about I make you one?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.880
You made this?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000
What if it doesn't taste good?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.920
Let me show you a rope

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.560
As long as the ingredients are fresh enough

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.160
they taste grate

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.720
Even if you're not good at cooking

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.239
And I think cooking for others

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.560
is a great skill

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040
You understand?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What's up

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.960
Please pay attention to your image, okay?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.440
Is the soup ready?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.160
Let me taste it, what
did you put in the soup

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.240
Not good?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.200
This soup is really good

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.240
What did you put in the soup

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.440
The magic?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.280
I put some seafood in it

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.840
Haven't you ever had sefood soup?

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.720
Why I always thinking the kiss?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.280
It's really delicious

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.120
I can be a cook

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.560
Are the other cooks dead?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.959
First of all, the ingredients are good

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.160
The most importang is

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:22.280
that there's a lady-killer next to you

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.000
And exuding an enchanting breath

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.320
That's why the soup tastes good

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.160
Are the other lady-killers dead?

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.120
Me?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.760
Yongze

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.360
Your friend Bai Yongze let me tell you

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.160
Not worth mentioning in your life

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm working here

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.240
To comletely forget you

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.520
This is a nice place

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.240
Song Cha

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.240
Song Cha, Song Chacha

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.720
Lan Tian mistook you for Song Chacha?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.600
Lan Tian, I got it

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.040
Unfortunately, you fired Chacha

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.880
An unfortunate woman

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600
Jiang Shi?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280
Say what?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.319
Are you going to land training?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.599
What the hell are you talking about?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.160
Why am I going to land training?

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.440
Why told me that?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.240
Does he miss me?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.280
What a pitiful man Yongze is!

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.159
They are going to land training

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160
Why are we going there

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
We're going there

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.600
so you can see Lan Tian

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.520
Nah

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.879
While your fake boyfriend

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.360
is still here

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.960
Go ahead

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.960
Maybe it's the last day

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.159
What's your mean

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.960
What's the last day

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.080
Bai Yongze, Bai Yongze

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880
What exactly do you mean?

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.080
Are you leaving tomorrow?

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.160
Tell me, are you?

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.800
Where are they

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.760
You're not gonna tell me?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.240
Well, I'll go tomorrow

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.480
I found a sponsor

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.480
So, today is the last day

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.080
to be your fake boyfriend

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Just go

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920
Hey?

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.840
What's wrong?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.000
My foot hurt, I canlt walk

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.120
Wake up, Lan Tian

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.640
That's waht you want

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.880
She has gone

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.000
That's what you want

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240
Look out

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720
Here we are

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.320
So beautiful

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
What's that

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520
Fireflies

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.760
There are no fireflies in the city

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.440
Except here

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.480
When night falls, we can see it

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.640
I see it for the first time

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760
Song Chacha

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160
I have something for you

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.040
On Valentine's Day

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400
I brought it for you

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.440
That

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.440
If you feel stressed

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
You can refuse

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Very well

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.880
How do you know my size

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.480
I won't tell you

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.080
I'm going to show Lan Tian off

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.760
I told you I'd take you home

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.680
I wasn't drunk today

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
And

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.760
The lamp's fixed

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.400
Really?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Who

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.440
Who fixed it?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.520
I can't believe it

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800
It's said that

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.000
the lamp

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.480
was fixed by a moron who
wasn't afraid of death

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.120
And then the moron fell off

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.520
Thank you, my boyfriend

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.920
Love you, my girlfriend

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320
Chacha

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.000
What happened

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.760
Lan Tian took me to dinner

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.800
I haven't visited in a long time

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.960
Have a cup of tea before you go

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.320
Thank you, aunt but it's getting late

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720
Don't worry

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.040
I won't let Chacha go anywhere

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.880
Don't you worry

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.120
What' my mom's mean

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.600
Why she won't let me go anywhere

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.440
I told aunt let you spent
more time with her

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.920
It's good for her health

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.760

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360
I'll help you

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.840
Why do you suddenly care about me?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400
Don't get me wrong

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.840
Aunt didn't know we broke up

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.880
Just doing my job

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.560

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.200

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.400
Pity me?

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.760
What were you thinking about

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.120
Pack up

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.400
There're something I don't
know if I should say

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.840
Break words

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.240
Nah

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.040
It's better not to say

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040
Then don't

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.320
There, there, I'll say

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.120
Your new sponsor

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.840
is a movie company

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.000
which is connected with Li Bao

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.600
What's your mean

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.360
It's connected with Li Bao?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.200
Li Bao,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.080
She accept a strange movie

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.600
It's said that she was dressed
outrageously in the film

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.800
And the movie might be a porn

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.079
She accept it

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:04.760
is trying to get the company's boss

00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:06.360
to fund you

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.760
What? Who said?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.720
The company's boss?

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040
No, no, no

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.800
It's Zhou..Zhou Xiaohu

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480
That's enough

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.520
Sister, have a cup of tea

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.440
How about the thing I asked you to do

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.000
It's all done

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.880
I told Yongze's agent

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.839
My sister's life is ruined

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.440
Because of Bai Yongze

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.360
What did he say?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.720
It's ruined

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.240
No, no, that's he said

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.520
not me

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.280
Don't be angry, sister

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.280
In my view,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.519
Pu Jun is a loudmouth

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.776
who cannot be trusted with secret

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.400
He must have told him

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.800
See? I told you

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.400
Li Bao

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.040
Honey

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.919

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.200
on the condition

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.799
of sponsoring me?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.800
Did you?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.479
Honey, how

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.720
I don't need sponsorship

00:17:23.598 --> 00:17:24.598
Refuse it now

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.319

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.319
I can do anything for you

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.920
To support me

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.840
so you can take the request

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.639
whatever it is

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.680
And dressing outrageously
and posing pretentiously?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.720
What are you thinking of?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.720
Whatever, after the video thing

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.200
I'm out of work

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.760
So, stop blaming yourself

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.760
You're the most important for me

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.200
Refuse it

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.520
Right now

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.240
Honey

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.680
Answer me

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.320
I'll do what you told me

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.760
But could you come see me tomorrow?

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.040
I feel low

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.640
I'm out of work and my
ex-boyfriend threathned me

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.960
I'll call you

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.600
I told you

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.320
Bai Yongze really treasured me

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.960
You are good

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.719
Are you really gonna take it

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.520
For Bai Yongze?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.720
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.640
I've always been pure, okay?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.580
Even if they pay me hundreds
of millions, I won't go

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.200
Hundreds of millions, for you?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.960
You're not hot

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.959
I thought we found a dependency

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.520
So I spent all our money

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.800
What should we do now?

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.080
Are we going back home?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240
Fang Jingjing

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.240
God, Are you the Olympic
champion FangJingjing?

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.520
Don't we talk for a second?

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.919
I'm busy, sorry

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.880
Bai Yongze, do you like swim?

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.280
If you don't

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.320
Jist chasing for what you like

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.880
Or

00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:28.760
No amount of effort is worth anything

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200
What's the worth?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.800
Just stories imposed in me

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.360
By those who envy me

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.240
Whatever you did before

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.960
That's all for

00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:44.800
living up to what dreams have to do

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.160
If you really love it, you won't fail it

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.560
So you must find the answer

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.560
She is his fan

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320
What?

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.800
You mean, the daughter of
Jinxing Group's chairman's

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.159
is Bai Yongze's fan?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.280
Looks like I'm going to the Hainan myself

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.200
You take Lan Tian and Bai Yongze

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.960
And we have dinner together

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.600
It's not fair to Song Chacha

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.880
If she goes, I'll go

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480
That what you say

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.680
Okay

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.800
Just do what you want

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.640
God, I Drove him away

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.800
What should I do

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.976
All I know is that you begged him,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.760
and he's coming back

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.640
Why should I beg him?

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.800
That's your business

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
But

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.319
You two are good friend

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320
Good friend

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
Don't think everything is

00:21:28.561 --> 00:21:29.880
what it looks like

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.000
but

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.479
You two

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.759
are always together

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.120
What's wrong with you now?

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.840
Are you gus at loggerheads?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.280
Are you?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.600
How about me?

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800
Are you kidding me?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.600
Let me beg him?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.280
That's what you should do

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.360
Look

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.240
I don't care whose fault it is

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.080
I won't beg him

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.440
But he is your teammate

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.096
I don't need a teammate like him

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:08.720
Sorry

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.159
As a coach

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.519
You have no emotion

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.040
for your teammates?

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.760
No

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.759
Not even

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.680
a sense of responsibility?

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.760
No,

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600
So

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.240
Please get away from here mow

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.160
If you don't, I'll go

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.240
I never expect you to be like this

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.680
Please, help me

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.559
If Bai Yongze doesn't come back,

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.560
I'll die

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.960
I can give you money, I can
give you whatever you want

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.000
Then, then I promise to date you, okay?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.400
What's you mean? I beg him

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.640
And I have to date you

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.360
Are you a gift to me? What's your logic?

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.520
Anyway

00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:14.839
You must help me to find him back

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.200
Please

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200
No

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.000
Okay?

00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:19.480
No, I told you

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.120
Chach Huang

00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:23.160
Would you knock it off?

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.360
To avoid misunderstanding

00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:25.721
I don't want to ruin my reputation

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.159
Please, just the last time

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.120
Please, okay?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.960
He said we were no longer in touch

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.080
What's wrong with him

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
Coach

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.200
I am about to aboard the plane

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.760
Just come to the point

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.880
What's the matter if you miss your flight

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480
What?

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.560
Well, let me say this

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.560
There's a madman, not Lan Tian

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.080
Is Lan Tian's sister, Lan Xin

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.040
She asked me

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.360
to get you back

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.340
Not Lan Tian, is Lan Xin

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.760
I'm not a person

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.680
who do anything for others

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440
But, her words

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.840
Changed my mind

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.080
She asked me, as a coach

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.840
Do you have feelings

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.280
For your athletes?

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.080
It seems to question my
attitude to my career

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.120
to my career

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.760
I recall the time when a was a player

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.760
I hoped I could have a coach

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600
who concerned me

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.520
If I had

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.600
My life will be Better

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880
Right?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.160
So you means you want
inject feelings into me

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.880
Not to you, but to me

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.120
I hope

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.479
I can put some emotion and enthusiasm

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.720
on my job

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.040
especially on someone like you

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640
who is dawdling

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.520
having no idea of his limitations

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400
but

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.160
gifted

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.360
I wanna try

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640
So

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.200
Is that a declaration?

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.680
I'm not your type

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.000
You don't have to be a prick, okay?

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.440
Ahyway

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.320
I told you

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920
Just believe your choice.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080
I hope you can

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.600
challege yourself

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.640
I really hope so

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.600
Nana, here you are at last

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.360
How is everything

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.120
You must be exhausted

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120
It's okay

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.800
There is beautiful

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.640
It's a feast for the eyes

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.440
Really, you should often come here

Our service is always ready for you

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.360

Okay

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.480

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.560
Uncle Lan

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.640
Where is Bai Yongze's trained swimming pool

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.000
Can I see him training?

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.080
Of course

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.960
I'll arrange it for you

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.080
Thank you uncle Lan

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400
Lan Xin

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.040
Go see what Bai Yongze's doing

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.840
Now?

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.720
Of course, when do you want

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.360
Okay.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.560
It's great that you can come back

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.680
You still care about me

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.040
If you're coming back

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.600
Why held the farewell party?

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.200
You've been gone a few times

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.800
THis isdn't a gotel

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.440
I'm sorry to bother you

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.400
Lan Tian, did you get him back?

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080
No, I didn‘t

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.960
If he will go, I feel relieved

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040
Why si?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.640
You must for DongChacha

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.240
No, I'm for coach

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.120
Coach Huang? That's impossible

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.480
You must for Song Chacha

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.759
How great is the power of love

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.760
Shut up

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360
Bai Yongze

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.200
Hello, Bai Yongze, I'm your big fan

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.640
I'm so excited to see you

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.880
Really really excited

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.239
This is

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.640
the daughter of Jinxing
Group's chairman's, Jin Nana

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.080
Hello

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320
Hello

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480
Hello

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.840
Nana

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.240
I wanted to invite you to dinner

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.880
And it's been delayed this day

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.160
Yeah

00:28:59.680 --> 00:28:59.960
Lan Tian

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.480
Are you an athlete now?

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.680
I thought you'd take over the uncle

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.599
I'm far away from

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.600
the professional athlete

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.200
And more far away from
taking over my father

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.800
I'm fine now at the resort

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.320
Bai Yongze, what's your point as a friend

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.840
I think Lan Tian has great potential

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.400
Yeah, I think so

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.720
So you two, must do your best

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080
I'll go first

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.280
Wait, Bai Yongze

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.720
How's your reaining environment?

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.560
Anything you need?

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.960
Nana, you don't have to worry

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.559
Our training conditions here

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.600
are first-rate

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.200
Just go

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.480
Ah, I've got it

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640
Uh-huh?

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.200
Let me show you arope

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.480
As long as the ingredients are fresh enough

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.920
they taste grate

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.360
Even if you're not good at cooking

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.119
And I think cooking for others

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.200
is a cool skill

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560
You understand?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.000
My personal chef

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.519
Bai Yongze is so famous

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.320
Doesn't the swimming star

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.800
have a private chef?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.760
He does, of courese, he does

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.720
We're recruiting for him

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.240
A celebrity chef will be here

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.520
in a few days

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.160
Nah, I already have a choice

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.440
What? To be your private chef?

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.720
So you're not going to go away?

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.640
Yes, for some personal reasons

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800
So do you agree?

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.360
You told me

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.079
cooking for others

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.200
is a cool skill

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.960
Yeah

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.880
But to be a private chef

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.120
I never learned to cook

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.920
I can only eat and identify ingredients

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.360
But It's too difficult to cook

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.240
Where are you taking me?

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400
You

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.440
Why, why are you here

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.760
She is the person I want to employ

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480
She?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.160
Are you kidding me?

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.879
She doesn't even have a certificate

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880
How can she cook for you

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800
I only want to employ her

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240
Uncle Lan

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.080
Maybe she's got something unique

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.080
Just do what he want

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.520
Thanks for your understand

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.400
Okay, okay

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.360
To make you do this

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.440
is to respect Miss Nana's opinion

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.320
Well

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.760
Well let's go

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.400
Why make me so embarrassed

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.320
I don't want you to run and hide

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.000
Just face it bravely

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.840
They didn't put you in trouble

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.880
It's yourself

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.760
You look down on yourself

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.160
You have to think zbout your future

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.800
Maybe one day you'll like cooking

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.360
and become a famous cooker

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.440
or a dietician

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.640
Right?

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.080
I've told you so much

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.280
I'm going to crying

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.680
Hey, I'm crying

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.080
Chacha

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:26.800
Uncle Lan

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.719
Do you know

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720
the Bai Yongze's chef?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.120
We've met several times

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.560
Do you know why I admire Bai Yongze?

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480
Why

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.160
Because he's not as mean as I am

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.920
He has the courage I don't have

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.680
He is the only person

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.960
who makes me feel inferior

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.280
What

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.840
You employed Song Chacha?

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.920
Why didn't you discussing it with me

00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:11.840
before you making such a childish decision

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.839
I've made more childish decision

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:15.840
What decision

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.040
To make you my agent

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:21.560
You you

00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:24.000
You know how it's to be your agent?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.320
You fell in love with Song Chacha

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.520
I'm gonna help you hide it

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.040
And help you act

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.320
And worried about your trouble

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.736
I'm suffering a nervous breafdown

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.480
and can't sleep every night

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.280
Look, to cover the dark circles of the eyes

00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:37.960
I wear sunglasses every day

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.960
I think

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.600
looks better with sunglasses

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.199
Nasty guy

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.040
Hello, sister

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I'm not your sister

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.120
Oh sorry

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.839
All I saw was your hair

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.840
How did your shopping go?

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.320
Now that I agreed to be your private chef

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.280
I'm going to try

00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:06.640
Be brave

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.640
Song Chacha

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.040
Are they sucked?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.160
Is it for people?

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600
Rea, really?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.840
Oh, it's terrible

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.840
But I made it from recipe

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.880
Did I treat salt as sugar?

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.960
Did you treat Coke as soy sauce

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.880
I'm afraid so

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.040
You almost had me there

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.320
You told me you know the ingredients

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160
What are these

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.040
I really know

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.479
I know

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.656
all the precious ingredients you tole me

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.640
Such bird's-nest

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.840
I used to do a lot of research on food

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.920
But I never actually cook it

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.319
So I think

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.200
Cooking is a cool thing

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.360
God

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.400
I was cheated

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.120
So you can just eat, right?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.200
But I can't just give up

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.760
I'll work hard

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.720
I shouldn't encourage you

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.160
After the test

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.959
We dicided to

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.840
send two people to the competition

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.640
Bai Yongze and Lan Tian

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.680
Coach, I am not ready yet

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.200
You needn't reatd

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480
You need experiments

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.080
According to the text

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.000
I don't think that's your best performance

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.800
Just enjoy the game, you know?

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.800
Can I not going?

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720
Why

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.760
We had those plans

00:37:39.761 --> 00:37:41.680
Who is within 1min and
55s, who is taking part

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.160
As for me

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.160
This is my chance to make a comeback

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:46.960
It's too important for me

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.440
At least

00:37:48.441 --> 00:37:50.201
I have to compete in a
race which is deserve

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.199
So, you think

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.360
It doesn't deserve you

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.400
in the race which Lan Tian can take part in

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.840
I didn't mean it

00:37:59.841 --> 00:38:01.600
So what's your mean

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.920
What the race

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.480
which is deserve

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.200
You did do well last time

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.760
But to be honest

00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:10.720
You've been doing badly these days

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.680
You either lose your temper

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.080
or you fight

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480
and affected your body

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.040
Okay

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.280
I'm gonna put you

00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:20.521
in an international competition

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.016
and take part in 100m
freestyle that is your best

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.960
How fast can you be?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.039
So

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.320
The most important thing

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.320
is to test your training results

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.440
and

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.320
raise your self-confidence

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.280
Just keep in mind, stop showing off

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.800
Taking it step by step

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.440
Understand?

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160
Okay

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.560
Let's training

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.440
It semms like

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.760
Lan Tian, you really like freestyle

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.880
Finally, do you want to overtake me?

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560
Come on

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.680
Let's cheer for yours competition

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.480
Cheers

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.240
At this sxciting moment

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.680
I'm going to the bathroom

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360
And

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.360
Don't speak tale of me

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.560
after I leave

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.600
Just leave

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.200
Go

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.200
Keep in mind

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.600
Chacha

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:07.520
I employed Chacha as a private chef

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.520
Please don't mention her

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.720
She is your girlfriend now

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.960
But she has nothing to do with me

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.520
No matter why you hired her

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320
It don't matter to me

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040
The better it is

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.760
From where I stand

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.560
I have to mention it

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.600
Before you care about it

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.200
Just pay mor attention to the competition

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.160
So are you

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.200
Challenging me?

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.880
If not

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.160
I won't swim

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.960
So

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.120
Let me ask you for one thing

00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.760
To you. Am I your friend

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.360
or your opponent?

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680
Let me answer first

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.760
For me

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.080
You'll be my friend all the time

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.240
Even if

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.120
You're challenging me

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800
Understand?
