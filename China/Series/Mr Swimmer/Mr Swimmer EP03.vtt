WEBVTT

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.440
Anyway

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
I can't leave like this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840
I am already here

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.280
It won't hurt to see him

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.720
I said it last time

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.760
I wouldn't just leave this behind

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.559
Do you know what this

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.190
woman wants to do to me?

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.720
Wait, who the hell are you?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.600
What do you want from me?

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.800
What do you want from me?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.240
Is it you who

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.520
made a copy of my phone?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.080
What are you talking about?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.359
Didn't you go through my phone

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880
and send the video

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.640
to the journalist

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.656
I don't know what you are talking about

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200
So, you threatened me

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.000
Right?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.480
You crazy? I didn't do that.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
Hold on.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720
Wait a minute.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.920
She said she didn't, she didin't

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.120
How do you know?

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.160
How you doing?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.200
Ha~how am I dong?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.520
You~

00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.560
What do you expect?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.360
I am fine, thank you?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.640
Or sorry, do we know each other?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.920
Should I just wait for you do nothing

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.440
and think about nothing
like a fool

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.560
Don't you feel guity?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.400
Can we have a moment?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.640
What the is going on here?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.360
He said he didn't know who Song Chacha is

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.280
Didn't see that coming

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.920
You mentioned Lan Tian last time?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160
You know him?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.640
I am asking if that asshole is with you

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.800
Lan Tian
Do you know is who Song Chacha?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.120
You are really that Lan Tian

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.440
Lan Tian is the one who
is getting married to me

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.920
But he didin't show up.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.720
There is a story of you

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.920
You cut our conection
when you went to America

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.640
I blamed myself for everything

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.040
I felt guilty because I
wasn't there for you

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.000
I was very upset

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.000
All I could do is to wait

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
What about you?

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.920
I didn't ask you to wait

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120
What?

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.440
I fell in love with someone else

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.840
We can't go back anymore

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.840
So

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.400
So you just leave me alone in the wedding?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.000
Why didn't you just tell me?

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.600
You are afraid I won't walk away?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.480
Wedding? What wedding?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.520
There is no need for this
conversation to go on

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
I am asking you, what wedding?

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.559
You reallly don't know

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560
or you are pretending?

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.040
Such a great actor

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.560
Didn't you have your

00:06:10.561 --> 00:06:11.840
father prepare our wedding?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.560
And said our promise is a promise

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.760
and you wanted to get
married to me right now?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.360
You went to the wedding without asking me?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040
Are you a fool?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.480
I didn't know that

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
that wedding.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160
Because you said,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.560
you will show up

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.320
whatever happens

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.960
Because even how ridiculous it is

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.120
I just want to see you.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.880
The end won't ever change any more.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.280
Because you fall in love with someone else.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.440
We will get married

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.480
no matter what happens.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.760
What if we break up before that?

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.400
Even you don't love me,
I'll still love you.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.360
You are a fucking coward

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320
I don't love you

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.760
I just fall in love with someone else

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.640
I didn't know that that wedding.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
Because you said,

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.120
you will show up

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.880
whatever happens

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.680
Because even how ridiculous it is

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.760
I just want to see you.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.000
Why is he standing there?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.360
You will get sick

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.800
Go inside.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:03.800
Just leave me,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.400
I have to take care of you

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.360
if you catch a cold.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.760
I told you to leave

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.320
Where are you going?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.640
Lan Tian.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.000
Book me a ticket to Beijing.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080
Right now.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.200
What happened, mom?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.520
Your uncle's lawyer called

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.720
you uncle comitted a few
crimes cocerned with

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.240
tax evasion and so on.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.400
What?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.080
But your uncle called

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.720
he would kill himeself

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.720
if we don't get him out

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.180
He will kill himself

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.320
What should we do?

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.840
What don't perple play by the rules?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.360
It' s annoying.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.240
Hello, dad

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.000
Yong Ze

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.480
Have you started training officially?

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040
Yes, of course.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.400
You are not watching TV, right?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.839
How is taht possible?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.880
Have you met your coach?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.040
What's his name?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
Eh~

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.360
His name is...

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.839
His name is...

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.000
He does have a name?

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
Oh~ dad,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.200
I have to go to training.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.440
I'll call you back.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.240
I gotta go.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.320
Yong Ze?

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.360
How does he know?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.360
Is there a security camera here?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.480
What do you want?

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.880
Another one, illegal gambling.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.560
Dad

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.080
Fine

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.320
If you don't do

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.880
what I say,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.680
Cha Cha might be in desperate situation.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.040
What? Are you ganna ask me

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.400
how could I get that wedding done?

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.840
I am telling you, if I don't do that,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.000
you will be cheating on me.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.120
And just like you went to see

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.800
Song Chacha behind my back.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.240
I am warning you.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.759
Don't mess up with her

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.640
since I agreed you to swim.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.200
I prpmised you that before

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720
We can't and

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.319
we are not together.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.280
Then,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400
make a stand.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.680
I am your son.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.000
You gotta believe me.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.920
Sometimes I don't even believe myself.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560
That's your business.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280
Wait

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.360
Lan Xin.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.920
I will arrange you a position.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320
Position?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600
Not in here.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.280
You go to Lan Tian's resort

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.000
to help him manage it.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760
What?

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.440
Why?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.520
Because you broke my rules.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.239
I agreed you to swim

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.480
on condition that

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.080
you can't meet Song Chacha.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.880
Now you met her,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240
and broke my rules

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.720
You have to be punished.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.280
I don't want to get involved

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.640
in your business.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.480
But if you don't want to manage it,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.359
I will have someone do that.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360
Isn't that good?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.600
That's good,

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.360
Thanks, dad.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.280
You are my god of wealth!

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.399
What is this guy doing?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.640
He didn't answer my phone.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.480
Hello, Oh, Dad

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840
Yong Ze

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.840
No beer at night

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.000
Just relaxed, I am sober now.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.520
That does no good to your bady.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.600
Undestand?

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.080
Yes, yes, understand.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.240
Ok OK OK

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
Don't stay up late, dad.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.400
En.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.720
My gosh.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.320
Did he place a security camera here

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.280
You went to the wedding without asking me?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600
Are you a fool?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.200
I didn't know that

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.120
that wedding

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Because you said,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.360
you will show up

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.080
whatever happens

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.960
Because even how ridiculous it is

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.320
I just want to see you.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640
Is that Fang Jingjing? That
winner of Olympic Games

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.520
What's she doing here?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.960
She came to replace our coach

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.640
Such great news

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.200
It's said that she just
graduated from America and

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.320
she's doing research in university.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.279
Guan Jie,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.280
I find you well informed

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720
Of course

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.400
I only focus on sports news every day.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.160
You only cares acout eating.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.160
Hello, I am Fang Jingjing.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.720
Yes, Coach Fang Jingjing.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.919
Thanks to Lan Tian.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.380
We have her be our mentor

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.880
Let's welcome her.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.540
Today, I'd like to give you a simple test.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.000
Just relax and fill it.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.120
And then,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.280
I am gonna run some

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.280
brain wave test.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.740
Please cooperate.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.140
After all these things,

00:17:07.141 --> 00:17:08.181
we will star our training.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.320
Where is Lan Tian?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.070
I called him. He said he
was busy with something.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.960
Bai Yongze, do you remember me?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.400
I don't forget

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.856
You don't have personal
relationship, don't you?

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880
Go away.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.400
Good, thanks for your cooperation.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.360
I will let you know when I get results.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960
So, see you

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.680
Thank you, Miss Fang

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960
See you next time.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.800
Bye.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.560
Enough

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.920
She is here to work

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.640
Not like you, just wasting time.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.560
Coach Huang, can we start training?

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.320
What's the hurry?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.720
You want everybody to
know you are workaholic

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.160
cumbersome

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.240
You still play by yourself today.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.840
Get ready, rest of you

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.440
Jiang Shi, attention

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.720
Guan Jie, what are you doing? Come on

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.800
what are you doing, cumbersome?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.800
Zombie? Floating on the water?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Come on

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.040
Come on

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.320
What should I do?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.600
Take two more days off.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.800
I have owed too many favors in my life.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.040
You have to let me do something.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.840
You just find a flat before moving out.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.920
Don't be stubborn.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.440
Do you still have contact with Lan Tian?

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.400
It's said you uncle's lawyer

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.840
is a acquaintance of his.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.680
Maybe he can help.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.320
I semm to talk too much.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.600
I'd like to ask who

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.000
do you admire most between
you and Lan Tian?

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.919
You are everywhere!

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920
Shut up.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.520
I just asked and confirm it.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.400
After all,

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:40.560
I don't want to

00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:42.840
share my idol with too many people.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.120
Because I am super possessive

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360
I will kill you

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.880
I am crazy.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.080
There is a video that can

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.240
prove your relationship
between you Lan Tian.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.120
So you aren't interested in women at all
right?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.200
What are you doing?'

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.040
If that video

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.840
comes out.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.000
People will misunderstand us.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.040
Who did this to me?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.000
Only Song Chacha touched my phone

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.560
But what does she want?

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.040
OK, keep it that way.

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.560
That's right,

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.760
Yes

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.920
Yes,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.160
Perfect.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.520
Thanks everyone.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.720
Thank you.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.720
It takes a few hours to finish this.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.400
Pull off

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.976
every announcement of this magazine.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Understand?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.320
I mean, there is no others.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.760
Since you mentioned, there were more
announcements when your rumors flew

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.720
And a lot of reporter
wanted to interview you.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800
Now..

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.480
Hey, gossip girl.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.000
I did a exclusive interview
of Bai Yongze two days ago.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.000
Now you know that he is in Hainan.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.120
How would I know?

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.640
Rumor is rumor.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.520
What is going on between you?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240
Why did I heard that he

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.280
had another girlfriend in Hainan.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560
Another one?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.640
The only thing I am sure about

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.560
is they have a ambiguous relationship

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.319
When do you give me

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.759
the video of Bai Yongze and Lan Tian

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.200
that you show me?

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040
I 'll be in touch.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.960
Fine, in this world

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.960
a friend in need is a friend indeed.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.680
I'll wait for your call.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.960
Come on, drink some water.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.400
Is this Bai Yongze？

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.720
He is famous agan.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.560
And the editor say there is

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.640
a shotting of bikini in Qingdao
I pull it off

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.160
I am going to kill you right now.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.080
You told me to do that!

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.700
Hello, I will take that bikini shotting

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.960
But, not in Qingdao

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.040
Let's change a place.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.080
You reallly don't know
or you are pretending?

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:56.960
Such a great actor

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.120
Didn't you have your

00:24:58.121 --> 00:24:59.400
father prepare our wedding?

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.560
And said our promise is a promise

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640
and you wanted to get
married to me right now?

00:25:02.641 --> 00:25:04.321
You went to the wedding without asking me?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960
Are you a fool?

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.960
I didn't know that

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.760
that wedding.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.520
Really?

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.600
You fall in love with someone else?
But you still can help

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.480
That bulb again?

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.080
It's said you uncle's lawyer

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.520
is a acquaintance of his.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.480
Maybe he can help.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360
What's she doing?

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.840
I am just crazy.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.400
She looks so suspicious

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.120
I can't trouble uncle Kong too much

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.480
I gotta make more money.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.960
Hello, I am Song Chacha

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.720
That one called you last time.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.720
It's still the thing that

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.080
we talked about. That video?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.720
I can send it to you right now.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.800
But can you give me more money?

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.680
I am in a difficult situation.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.040
OK, yes

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.320
I am sending it right now.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.680
Because of money, right?

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.080
What?

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.800
Don't be innocent

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.200
I heard everything.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.816
I don't know what you are talking about.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.840
Let go of me.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.720
I told you to let go.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120
Hey,

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.880
You, you ok?

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720
Hello,

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:43.080
Hello, Bai Yongze

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.120
Hey, wake up.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.800
Wake up, Bai Yongze

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640
Is he ok?

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.000
We will see after doc checks him.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.480
Damn it, what's Cha Cha's number?

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.760
Hello, who is it?

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520
Cha Cha!

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040
This is Lan Tian.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320
Where are you?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240
Which hospital?

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.080
Why am I here?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280
And why are you holding

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160
my hands?

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.600
What do you want?

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840
You are crazy.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.200
This is hospital

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.680
And you won't let go of my hands.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.280
Nothing good happen when I meet you.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.440
I did this in case you run away.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.880
Tell me,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.720
Are you up to something?

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.160
You want to threaten me？

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.240
That's enough

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.880
You could be dead by now
if it weren't for me.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.920
You like curing people, don't you?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.119
What did I do

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.880
in my last life?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160
Where are you going?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.320
What the hell do you want?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.079
At leat wait until

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.360
we solve all problems.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.800
If you beg for my forgiveness on you knees,

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.320
I maybe merciful to

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.840
forgive you this time.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.760
Are you being delusional?

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.000
I don't know what video
you are talking about.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.400
But mine, has

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.920
noyhing to do with you.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.560
If don't,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.360
Prove it.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.560
What? You can't?

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.440
Or you won't?

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.120
What if I am right?

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.240
I will be your little brother

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.680
or your sidekick.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.360
You are kidding me?

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.200
Hey, you

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.560
Why are you together?

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.960
Eh~lt's complicated.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.520
Why now?

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240
Bad luck!

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.280
Let's talk.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.760
I have nothing to talk about.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.959
Even I feel I shouldn't mind your business

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.600
If you didin't reply me with that e-mail,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.640
when my father died,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.520
I was gonna give up

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.280
If you could remain silent,

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.320
maybe wouldn't be like this.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.120
So why did you give me hope?

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.119
What? Your father died?

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.480
You don't have bottom line, right?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.560
How could your father? When?

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.360
How do you explain that e-mail?

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600
What e-mail?

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.520
Maybe, you just don't care?

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.399
I won't ask you to remember

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.600
all of our memories.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.280
I just want some respect.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.800
Suddenly, I don't fell pathetic.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I just met my

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.560
rock bottom.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840
But you,

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.800
you are at the rock bttom your whole life.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.240
You are much worse than
the Lan Tian I know.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.760
Mr.Bai, you are wanted bydoctor.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:29.680
Have a seat, please.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.920
How do you fell? Better?

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.800
Much better.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.880
According to results,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.720
you are fine.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.160
Then why do I feel chest tight

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.520
,flustered and fatigue

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
and angina.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.560
Because being pressed and
mentally nervous can result in this.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.720
Yes, it's pressure.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.440
It's pressure

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.240
I suddenly stop

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.640
when I am runningfast.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.360
I am not superman.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.600
Of course I fell pressed.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.640
It's all because I met that bulb

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.200
when I am in a desperate situation.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.560
I promise to be your guardian angel.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.160
I promise to be your guardian angel.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.280
Along with your brother.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.520
Why did you say you don't know who she is?

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.920
Because I erased her from my memory.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.400
You did?

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.920
Cha Cha, this is Lan Tian.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.080
OK.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.240
I thought I did.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.400
At least there is some trace.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.280
Yes, there was a time

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.040
when we were, just like,

00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.200
meant to be.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.480
That dramatic?

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680
But you know what?

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.480
A lot of things are gone,

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:05.760
it's never going back.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.960
Everything is like dust,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.840
wind comes, it's all gone

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.320
Bullshit.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.480
Dad

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360
Dad

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.160
Dad

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.800
It can't be me, I didn't write this.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160
Lan Tian

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.680
Lan Tian

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880
Lan Tian

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.999
I seemed to hear

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.560
he went out.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.200
It's midnight

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.120
What's this?
