00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.560
Dad

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.680
I need to go to the loo.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
How is it going?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.320
Today

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.520
I just want to tell you about Bai Yongze

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.639
According to the files you showed me,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.479
he has sports anxiety symptom.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.920
Which is somatic anxiety

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.160
Somatic anxiety? Is that serious?

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.040
Find why?

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.879
And he will be fine with
some scientific training

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.520
But we can't leave me like this.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320
This has to be you, to assisst him

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.560
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.000
He left anyway.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.719
Just let it go.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.680
What?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.680
Check your time!

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.360
It's about time.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.360
Why is he not out yet?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.760
I am sorry, dad.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.920
I can't just leave Hainan like this.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.680
I need more time!

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.600
Is it Yong Ze? What idid he say?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360
Let's go.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.680
Just us?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.240
What about Yong Ze?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.960
Yong Ze

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.839
You scared me!

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.880
Why are you still here?

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.880
Watching you. Everywhere.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
Watching you.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.320
Who told you to do tha?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.320
Who? Your parents!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.120
You are not having constipation?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.520
No wonder it takes you so song!

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.200
I don't see other problems.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.680
Maybe is's just mental problem.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
Mental?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.320
Maybe you got

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840
some hit recently

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.760
or in your childhood.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.120
To be honest, you went through something,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.640
which cause your heart problem.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.000
No, I didn't.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320
What did doctor say?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.120
Constipation? Is that serious?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.760
No? So what's the problem?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.200
Mental problem.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.840
If I were you,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.679
your mom pushed you so hard,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.720
I couldn't get it out either.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.399
Does it really have something with

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.080
sports anxiety?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880
What?

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.800
But,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.680
How can I get back to the club?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.680
What the hell are you doing?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.480
I tell you what,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.040
he didn't go because of constipation.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.640
Shut up!

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.400
Anyway, that's it.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.040
You are going for training?

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.960
It's been a long time
since we last competed.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.320
So, interested?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880
Compete what?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.280
100m Free Style.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.200
Good.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.720
You are not in the game.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480
What are you thinking?

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.280
Can you tell me about it?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.320
What is this?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.240
My gratitude

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.000
Of what?

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.520
Frankly,

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.879
I really don't know our deal

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.880
is so important to you.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.360
You surprised me.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.150
Wait, you better be clear

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480
about what you said.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.760
You can get Bai Yongze back

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:40.240
within one day!

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.240
Impressed!

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.360
I didn't do that.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880
Don't explain!

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.160
I know it clearly!

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.680
Forget it, thanks!

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.480
Hope you enjoy the present!

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.640
Do your best, Song Chacha!

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.480
Left without a goodbye.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040
That's too much.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.799
So... sorry, I thought you left.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.320
I don't you are sleeping with a woman.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
Woman?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560
Hey!

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.280
Why are sleeping in my bed?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.399
Your mother told me to

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.320
watch you.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.600
What the hell? You really...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.920
Song Chacha. Song Chacha.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.240
It's a mistake.

00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:14.280
That was a mistake. There was no woman.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800
He is my agent.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.360
What's going on with them?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.640
I thought you were gone.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.240
He didn't catch the plane
because of constipation.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.280
Enough, shut up.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.680
It's not because of...

00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:35.840
You stop it!

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.279
You were sent to the hospital

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280
because you fainted.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720
You are dead, fucker.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320
Hey, what are you doing?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.719
You bully me every time!

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.840
Hey, what are you doing?

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.520
Get off me!

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
Let's talk!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.160
I believe we have empathy under water.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.680
But I recently found we got

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.720
seperated by something

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.800
Something that I can't see through.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160
Why?

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.680
Nothing! You think too much.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.480
I am goona ask you one last time.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.600
Do you have something hiding from me?

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.520
No!

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.120
How is that possible?

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.000
Did you say some bullshit

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.960
uneder the water?

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.640
I want to talk to you.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.720
Please think before you say something.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.120
You know what you are talking about?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.520
All I know is that you not yourself.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.880
There must be something wrong!

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.960
That's a lie.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.320
You can't fool me!

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.496
I told you I don't want anyone to

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.280
know my problem.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.240
Fine. Your secret is safe with me.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.880
But I have a request.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.640
One more.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.080
This your seventh one.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.560
One more.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.000
Why can't I get drunk?

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.920
Be my boyfriend.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.520
Just pretend to be.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.960
I want you to tell him

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.040
that we are in a romantic relationship.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.160
You are really insane!

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.040
What's wrong?

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.400
It's still daytime, and you are drunk.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.000
What's wrong with you?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Lan Tian.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.760
Did you ask what

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.960
what got us seperated

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.960
seperated by?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.920
I am telling you.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.120
I like Song Chacha.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.160
And we are in a relationship right now?

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.320
What? You are pretending to be in
a relationship with Bai Yongze?

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.680
Just like you said. I am
trying to get him back.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.240
I wonder if it's possible?

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.920
But if I got Lan Tian back,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.919
I would fire the manager first.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.160
And put you on that position.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.600
I think you are a clumsy bear.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.240
Didn't think you are a fox.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.560
But,

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.560
you can't let anyone know this.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.720
Especially Jiang Shi.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.280
We are not close!

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.040
Why would I tell that?

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240
As long as he is back,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.040
we can go back like before.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400
It should be like that.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080
Did you tell him?

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.520
What did he say?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.040
He wanted us to be good.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.840
That's it?

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800
He is not angry?

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.920
Not at all.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.039
So what did he look like

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.330
when he said 'I want you to be good'

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.350
Nothing.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.200
He must be angry inside.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.440
He is coming！He is coming！

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.480
Oh~

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.560
There is something in my eye.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240
Can you help me?

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840
Hey hey hey,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880
Did he look angry?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.320
No.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.360
You miss me so much.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.760
Do you have to eat with me?

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.320
This is...

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.360
Are they together.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.960
You don't know?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.760
They are so sweet now!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.400
Just like us.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.640
I don't wanna hit you with my spoon.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.960
Yong Ze.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120
Just a minute.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720
Yes, dad.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.360
Blind date?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880
Got it.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.320
You dad ask you to go for a blind date?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920
When?

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040
Now!

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.599
Bullshit

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.120
This is just my delusion.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.280
He didn't take me seriously.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.280
I cry a hundred times

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.760
just for him comforting me once.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160
I walk you home.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960
No.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.960
How can you go home like this?

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.120
I am telling you

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.760
that I have not been
drunk since I was born.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080
I am not.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.040
I am warning you

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.080
not to follow me.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.720
Or I'll sue you for abducting.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.640
Song Chacha, is that really hurt?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.760
Why do you have to turn a holiday

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.320
into a group outing?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
Right!

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.880
But why do you look so tired?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.600
Is is because Lan Tian
went for a blid date.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.760
I am not sure.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.280
I feel so gutless.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.039
I fucked my life

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040
up.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.120
So I plan to get rid of it

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.080
and go home with my mom.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240
What do you think?

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840
Where is Zhao Yan?

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.720
She just ran up there.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.760
Up? Thanks.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.840
Zhao Yan, Zhao Yan

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400
Zhao Yan.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.600
Where are you?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920
Just follow up.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.320
Where is Cha Cha?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640
She just went uo there!

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.040
Up? Such a troubling girl.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760
Zhao Yan.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.720
Zhao Yan.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880
Zhao Yan.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600
Zhao Yan.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.520
What should I do?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.520
What happened my angel?

00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:22.839
Don't cry. Don't cry.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.560
What happened?

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.399
Cha Cha is missing.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.079
I thought she is back.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.240
And her phone is powered off.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.519
What should I do? She must
get lost in the woods.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.560
How was she lost?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.520
What are you doing?

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.720
Yong Ze, Cha Cha is lost in the woods.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560
What?

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.040
Yong Ze! Get up first!

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:04.760
Jiang Shi?

00:23:04.761 --> 00:23:06.200
Lan Tian, I need your car now.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.080
What are you doing with my car?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.600
Song Chacha is lost in the woods.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200
Lan Tian.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:30.600
I am sorry. I am sorry. I am sorry.
I am sorry.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.600
I am sorry, mom.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.400
I shouldn't have left my brother alone.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.840
I am sorry, mom. I am sorry

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.480
Cha Cha, don't be scared!

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.320
I know you must be scared.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
Just wait there.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.240
Cha Cha where the hell are you?

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.120
Just wait for me. I am almost there.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.120
I will find you.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.400
Cha Cha. Song Chacha, Where are you?

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.640
Cha Cha

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.160
Song Chacha

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320
Cha Cha

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.080
Cha Cha, answer me!

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280
Cha Cha

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.200
I am sorry, mom.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.040
I shouldn't have left my brother alone.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.920
I am sorry, mom. I should
have protected my brother.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.080
I am sorry, mom.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280
Cha Cha

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.280
Cha Cha

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.280
Where are you?

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960
Cha Cha

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.160
I am sorry, mom.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.080
Song Chacha

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.560
Cha Cha

00:25:03.561 --> 00:25:04.640
Just answer me.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400
Cha Cha

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.240
Cha Cha

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840
Cha Cha

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.760
Are you OK?

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360
Are you really OK?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280
I am sorry.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.680
I am sorry, mom. I am sorry, mom.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480
Mom

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.960
Sweetheart. I am sorry.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.600
I didn't know you were in there.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.200
I am sorry.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.520
Let's go. It's OK!

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.560
Careful!

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.440
Watch it.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:23.320
Don't go. Don't leave me alone!

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.400
You have been troubling
since you were a child.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.560
What should I do with you now?

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.880
You goota take care of yourself. Got it?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.320
Is Cha Cha OK?

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.680
Cha Cha. It's all my fault.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.360
You wouldn't be lost if it weren't for me.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.640
I am so sorry.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.320
Enough, angel. Stop crying.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.520
You didn't do it on purpose

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.400
And she is back now.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.840
Bulb, are you Ok?

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.000
Lan Tian, are you ready on board?

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:38.600
What's up?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.160
Cha Cha got lost and fainted.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.720
She is in hospital now.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.280
Are you listening to me?

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.120
I am telling you I am leaving.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.600
Wait. Stop by my place.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:53.720
What?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.280
Just do it for me. Stay and watch her.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.040
OK? I gotta go.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.440
Only in this way

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.720
does she see hope

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400
when she wakes up.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.520
Even it's so slight.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.600
Bai Yongze, don't you understand?

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.319
It's not good even we

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.640
just ignore this

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.120
awkward relationship.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.959
Hey, angel, all you need is

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.040
to rest at home.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.840
Come on, let me walk you home!

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.280
Why are you so sweet?

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800
Not used to it.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.320
Not used to it?

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.000
I seem to be like this every day

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.000
Someone just don't see it.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.120
She just can't see it.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:13.040
You are saying me?

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.640
I am just comlaining!

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.880
If you are not happy,

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.400
just hit me.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.160
And I want it.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Come on.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.000
So I am gonna do it.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720
Jiang Shi.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.520
Oh, shit!

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.360
I almost had a heart attck.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.320
Left.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680
Left.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.080
Heart attack? You are so caculated!

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120
Angel! Angel!

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040
Almost forgot.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.920
Cha Cha.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.960
You are so

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.480
far away now.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.120
No more waiting. Leaving.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.599
Asshole, why don't you wait

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600
until morning?

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.280
Cha Cha.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.759
I really want Lan Tian to
be the first one to see

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.600
when you wake up.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.880
Cha Cha. What's wrong with you?

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.280
Anybody here?

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.840
No one is here?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.360
Cha Cha.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.200
Can I help you?

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.040
Please check her.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.680
She seems to have a fever.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.680
We will check her now.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.640
But, sir you...

00:33:42.641 --> 00:33:44.160
I am OK.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.840
I will get doctor right now!

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.240
Alright.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.120
Cha Cha. Cha Cha. Cha Cha.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.280
I am here. It's gonna be Ok.

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:06.640
Cha Cha. Lan Tian...

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.000
Don't hurry. Let's ask where she is now!

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800
Where?

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320
This way.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.320
She is ok. She is ok.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.240
Cha Cha. Cha Cha. Cha Cha.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.520
You OK?

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.960
Mom.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:32.600
It's mom. It's mom. Sweetheart

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.120
You feel better?

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.600
How do you know ...?

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.480
Lan Tian told me last night.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.520
He said that you fainted.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.520
He sent you to hospital.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.840
But it was too late.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.920
He told us to come in the morning

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.720
and visit you.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.440
So... I am OK, mom.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.920
Mom, don't worry about me.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.960
I know it, he was here all night.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.480
And I am not worried.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.600
Mam, don't worry.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.640
I think Cha Cha is fine now, isn't?

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.480
I feel I can run right now.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.600
You awake? Do you feel better?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.280
You know what?

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.039
Something maybe went wrong last night

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.360
if it weren't for your boyfriend.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:28.760
What?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.280
You had a serious fever.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.720
Thanks to your boyfriend.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.160
Cha Cha. Cha Cha. Cha Cha.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.920
Lan Tian. Lan Tian.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.240
We didn't what to do,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.080
thanks to Lan Tian.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.280
What the are are you doing?

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.480
This is so important. And you were absent.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.040
I am sorry.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.360
That doesn't help.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.439
You know this Gold Star Enterprise

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.040
is larger than ours?

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.560
I wish to unite through marriage

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.079
We seem not to have that luck.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.839
I don't care what methods you use,

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.520
make that luck.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280
You heard me?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880
What's wrong with you?

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720
Not talking?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:41.760
Is it

00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:43.360
is it because of Song Chacha?

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320
No.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.400
You know what it costs you

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.160
if you break our deal, don't you?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.760
I hope there is no next time.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.600
If things go south,

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.120
I have warned you.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.400
You had fight?

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.880

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.719

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:55.880
You were with him, right?

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.440
What are you talking about?

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.440
Look at hsi face,

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.760

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.760
That is worring.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.160
It will influence his training.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.600
Is there a drug store?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.720
Is is serious?

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:09.560
I don't know.

00:39:09.561 --> 00:39:11.600
I am so angry to see his face.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.320
I really need some herbal tea.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.640
I told you to leave me.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.400
Why do you get back so fast?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.040
Don't you go to breakfast?

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.440
What's wrong with your face?

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.360
You here!

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.680
What about hospital?

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720
I didn't make it.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.199
I don't care if you got drunk

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.840
or got into a fight with sommone.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.440
You should go to check her.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.760
I know what I am doing.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.720
What do you know? Ha~

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.720
You said you like her, right?

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.200
You are her boyfriend.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.320
You just can't let her go, can you?

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.320

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.360

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.840
I am right?

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.320
I will step away if that's true.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:30.200
You are giving your love to me?

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.840
But, I don't want it at all.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.280
I am not moved.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.880
There is no such thing

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.880
in my life.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.400
Love, contest?

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.520
There is schu thing.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.720
Win or lose. Bai Yongze.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.240
Do you give up because

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.880
you are afraid to lose?

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
No

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.999
So stop talking about that bullshit.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.040
About that bullshit.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440
And,

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360
Song Chacha

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.760
she is afraid of darkness.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.160
She can't sleep with lights out.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.160
I cancelled my blind date

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.240
for that.
