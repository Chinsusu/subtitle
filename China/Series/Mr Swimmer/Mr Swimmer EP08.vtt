I can do anything for you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.520
Even at the expense of my reputation

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.520
Don't you feet it?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.440

And want you to look after me

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.359
I regret breaking up

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.560
With you

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.440
I really regret it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.840
Sister, the time had come

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.520
Are you crying?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.480
Okay, Tears can replenish water

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280
Later, too

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.400
Just pit it at the door

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.720
But he should drink hot

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.199
Well

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.160

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
How old are you

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.800
You can't walk?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.680
What if

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.300
you disfigure?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.480
I don't know if it will leave a scar

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.200
Let me see

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800
If

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.760
It leave a scar

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.120
Your face

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.520
Just become more ugly

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.880
The porridge is here

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.520
I'm gone now

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.440
Ugly face

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.760
Bad temper

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.520
What?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.360
Ugly face, good ear

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.120
How can you be so sharp tongue

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.800
Did you cook it?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
Yeah

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.000
You can go after I eat it all

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Why

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.560
What if you poisoned?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
I

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.560
Relax your muscles

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.680
Why you

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:23.000
I want you to see the wat I look

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.360
To let you blame yourself for a lifetime

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600
This's just fair

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.200
But only in the begining

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.800
Not now

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.080
Because that's useless for you

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.800
So I wanna leave here

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.480
At first, Zhao Yan begged me to stay

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.319
Then

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.960
All sorts of of possip forrced me to stay

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320
And

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.160
Song Chacha, you can't do that to me

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920
What's the matter?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.320
Give me the beer

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.720
Give me the beer

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160
What's this?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.000
Abalone shell, broken by a hammer

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.600
There may be some residue

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240
What?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.200
By a hamer?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.760
Use your head please

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.720
Use the spoon!

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.960
How do I know

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.840
You didn't remove it's teeth?

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.080
Does it have teeth?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.520
I won't eat it

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.599
If you cook

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.480
like this again

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.840
You're in real trouble

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.040
If it wasn't for Jang Shi

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.520
It never would have happened

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.720
And

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.800
Why should I cook fou you?

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.000
You're not Lan Tian

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.600
I'll go

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840
Song Chacha

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.440
You'll never give up?

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.920
Even

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.360
A pencil

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.560
If you like

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.600
You'll never change, right?

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.760
What are you saying now

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.000
Lan Tian told me

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.240
He told that's who you are

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.640
Maybe I am

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.320
Are you okay?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
What that noise was?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.240
Did the fool girl fall again?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.040
Sister, where are you going?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.800
I haven't any work lately

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.480
I can only sit and get older

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560
I'll leave for Hainan

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.080
Do I look gaunt?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.760
Why do you go to Hainan for?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.920
You need to enchance your
cardiopulmonary function

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.719
Now continue to choking exercise

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.319
Swim as fast as you can

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.040
Change your air once at most

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.400
Ready

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.040
Coach Huang, I have a headache

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.880

00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.440
I have a headache

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.520

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.600

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.000
Ready, go

Ah, they're a little naughty

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.800

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.360

But, go down so a long time,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.640

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.200
Even his competition

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880

Walk slowly, you got cramp

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.360
Is it really just cramping?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.360

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.840
It's sunny rain

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.640
The strong wind brought in the
dark clouds in the distance

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.200
Just a wind

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.120
Is the sun useless?

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.920
It's like it just happened yesterday

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.200
It's all clear

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.800
But what really pisses me off is myself

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.280
Because at that moment

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.800
I felt it

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.560
Except Lan Tian

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.640
I never thought I'll be
with somenone else...

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.440
And my heart raced uncontrollably

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.280
In love with you

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.440
She lost herself

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.800
You're right

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.440
It does not matter to me

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520
So

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:27.680
Please

00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:29.520
Get out of my life

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.160
Don't hang around in front of me

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:33.959
Get ou of my sight,

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.440
Now

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.280
What I'm sad about is

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.440
I know he love her

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.800
But, I can't hate him

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.160
So I heat myself

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.400
If I didn't do this

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.080
I really don't have the
courage to let him go

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.480
I won't let him go

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:50.720
Congratulations

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.600
Congretulations

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.280
The groom is so old

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.320
Is it a wedding anniversary?

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.920
Maybe. You go first, I go to the toilet

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.160
Excuse me

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.160
Can you

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.360
Can you help me?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.520
Thank you, Thank you so much

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.560
My dad owes a lot of money

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.960
He forced me to marry this old man

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.840
But a have a boyfriend who love me

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.040
Don't let your boyfriend down

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:49.920
Just go, cherish this relationship

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.880
Do not miss it

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.120
Bride

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.760
Who are you

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.440
Do you know how much money

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440
the woman owes to me?

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:04.640
I'm sorry

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.040
Look

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:06.840
Either

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.400
You pay her debts

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.880
Or, you marry me

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.360
How much

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360
Who are you

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.519
Give me a number, I'll pay

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.040
I don't care who pao it

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.200
The thing is

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.680
my wedding can't be messed up

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.160
She had to accompany me through the wedding

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.000
Whoever she is

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160
Hands off

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.360
I said, I'll pay it

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.840
Anyway, don't touch her

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.720
I don't knows how much that woman owes you

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.280
But she

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.480
She can't be measured by money

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.800
I only left for a while

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.600
What happened again?

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:26.560
I never felt

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.280
this way before

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720
I just think

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.000
It'd be a pity that the girl
and her boyfriend are apart

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.040
and she have to marry an old man

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.720
That's pathetic

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.840
Good job

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.640
This is you, Song Chacha

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.720
Get me some dress

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440
Girls' clothes

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.120
Change to a favorite dress

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.600
I have my clothes in the locker room

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.760
I want you to take the wedding dress off

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.720
So, change

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880
I finished

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.520
Just put the wedding dress on the couch

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160
I'll give it back

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.360
So, this dress

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120
No need to bring it back

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.800
It's rubbish anyway

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.960
Just handle it yourself

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.720
I wish I could turn and see you

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:42.200
This time, I'm sure I'll
catch it even harder

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.040
Chacha, We agreed on the day of our wedding

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.880
That's how you dress up

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.920
in your wedding dress

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.840
And I lost my promise

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.880
Does your ex-boyfriend still like you

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.959
Not the way you think

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.760
I can feel it

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.319
Actually, you still like your ex-boyfriend

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320
Right

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.040
No

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.560
Less routine, more sincerity

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.520
I don't know

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.760
Anyway

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.120
Don't worry

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.120
I know your dream

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.880
So, I'm not gonna break it

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.800
Fine, but I know

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.280
My chances of realizing my dream

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.200
are still low

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.280
But, If you do it

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520
I shall let it pass

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240
No

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.880
I think, you should fight for it

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.840
Then don't regret it

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.480
Love is zbout timeing and action

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.920
You have a chance to gix it now

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.680
I don't hou much that woman owes you

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480
But she

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.680
She can't be measured by money

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.239
Save my heart rate

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.120
And get some honey

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.360
In my eyes

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.720
Nofocus, except you

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:41.240
I still remeber, the way you looked at me

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040
Today's training

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.080
Twice hands, forth legs

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.000
Anre you sure?

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.200
So what do you want, sixth legs?

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.680
I have my own habits

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.920
Sixth legs, I have done
from my youth upward

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.520
Good

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.480
Just show me

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.840
That was a deliberate attemp on my life

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.880
How coule Huang Donglei
to be Yongze's coach?

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.880
What a shame

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.920
Maybe they had other intentions

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.120
That's impossible

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.920
Huang Donglei is not reliable

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.600
It'll destroy Yongze

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.520
Who's esponsible for the consequences?

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.520
How could it be?

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.880
My Yongze is world champion

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120
Woeld champion

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.639
Who can teach the champion

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.439
Even those world-famous coaches

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.440
Can't preach

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.440
No

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.440
That's because something happened to him

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.440
Nobody dared to take over

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.160
Are you hot?

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.800
Wear a suit on such a hot day

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.160
My skin is too delicate

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.680
to withstand exposure

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.200
Look at you

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.080
Didn't tell him

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.480
we were coming

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.479
Yeah, Keep your strength in this way

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.840
Once more, forth legs

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.960
Come on!

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.800
Keep forth legs

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920
Huang Donglei

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.560
How did you train Yongze

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.200
Sixth legs even not enough

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.080
You let him did forth legs

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.519
That's the reason why he's
not good in the second half

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.520
What?

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.800
I don't need you to teach me

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.016
I'm improving her ability for second half

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:10.720
You know?

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.640
You're the onlt one who takes drugs

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.080
to improve your abilities, right?

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.520
Yongze, Here we go

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
Dad

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.680
He said that the basic
skills should be solid

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.400
Who is he talking to?

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.720
He is the one who not be solid

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.960
Good for nothing

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.320
I must be better at teaching than him

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.320
You're kiddingme

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.240
Anyway

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.799
Hong Donglei

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.840
Good for nothing

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.560
I taught him when he was a athlete

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.240
Have you ever heard of his medication?

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.480
Jst heard

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.710
Bustle up

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800
Almost done

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:18.920
But, our group has an assignment

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.120
Already ready

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320
Assignment?

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.670
Looks like an in-team test

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.760
Such a bad team, Test what?

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:37.480
So, are we leaving now?

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.670
Why don't you leave?

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.600
There's nothing to nostalgia

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.230
Yongze, you don't need this support

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.040
I can bring you up by selling my coolies

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.880
You can't even carry me

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.920
Who'll employ you

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480
You

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.080
Yongze, now is the most
important time for you

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.080
I know

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.840
Let me say goodbey

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.720
Honey, now that we're in Hainan

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.320
Why not have a rest for several days

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.720
I heard the beach here is great

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.600
We can blow on the beach
and bask in the sun

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.720
And drink a glass of romantic wine

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.760
That's what I've always wanted

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.280
I want to be with you

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.360
Can you be a little reserved outside?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.800
I think so

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.479
One mouth is annoying

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.560
That's awesome

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.600
You want to die?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.440
It wasn't going well when I came here

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.720
I didn't think it was the same when I left

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.360
Has given you a lot of trouble

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.360
Good you know

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.560
But I also enjoy a lot of things here

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.800
That I don't have

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.600
anywhere else

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800
You're wronged

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.040
Without you

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.160
I really appreciate it

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960
I just wanna see

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.600
How long could your father take care you

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.160
I admire, your father is a good coach

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.200
But you can't grow

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.200
under your dad's care

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.560
If you want to get back to the top

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880
You have to be

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:36.720
independent

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.600
Too bad

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.800
Qingshuiwan is a good place

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.360
You can't find a better place
than this in a short time

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.800
Such a pity

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Brother Yongze

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.160
What do I do when you're gone

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.040
What about our standard competition

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.440
Without him, someone else will come

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.400
Why don't you go with him

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.840
Just go

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.400
If I go

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.200
What zbout Tianshi?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680
I'm sorry

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.440
I don't want to go also

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.200
But, what can I do

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.079
Tah's fathers'way

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.480
To dnhance the sense of existence

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.680
In this regard, we are both alike

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.520
Its a pity I didn't fight you once

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.480
But I'll always be ready for you

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.560
Thanks, man. We'll be in touch

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840
Or

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.120
Is there any other reason

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.840
why you want to go?

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.720
You

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.000
I really want to swim with you

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.400
Song Chacha

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:55.680
Did you contact Bai Yongze?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.679
No, What's up?

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.040
Jiang Shi just test me

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.760
Said that Yongze is going to leave

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.840
Now

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.720
Yongze, why don't you get in the car?

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.880
Dawdling what?

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.680
Here I go

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.520
What's the hell is going on?

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.080
I haven't had time to ask

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.760
Is there another problem on his body?

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.040
Goodbey, lamp bulb

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.319
I told you

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.760
Bai Yongze should be the spokeman

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.080
Hou could you let him go

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440
So easily?

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.440
Then what else can I do?

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.559
Even if you hold him by the neck

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.719
Even if you hold him by neck

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.800
You have to let him to stay

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440
For what?

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.600
For me

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.160
For you? Why for you

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.320
Do I have to tell you?

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.760
You'd better tell me

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.480
I don't know at all

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.280
You know

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.359
Anyway

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.560
You have th get him back inthree days

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.280
Such a crazy woman

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.760
Every time she shows up, she troubles me

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.320
Who is she?

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.980
Dad, I need to use bathroom
