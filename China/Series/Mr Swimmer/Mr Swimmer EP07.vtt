WEBVTT

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960
Why do you get in my way?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.600
You are getting in my way!

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720
What's going on here?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.176
You want to tell me something?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.720
OK, you first.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.910
You don't want to say?

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.320
Fine

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.759
I will wait for your apology.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760
When you are available.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840
Are you out of your mind?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.960
Who the hell are you? Apologize?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.799
Is there any

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.840
appetitive food?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.320
Yes, we do.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.120
What?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.560
As long as you move

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.960
your eyes away from Miss Song

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.920
I go and check for your request

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.360
Your family are so funny

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.879
Funny? That's rude.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880
I will finish her later.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920
I invited you because

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.040
you are Lan Tian's sister.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.840
And I am the CEO of this resort.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400
What does it concern me?

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.600
Your fate is on my hands.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.760
Hey, you owe me a supper

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.480
Cha Cha.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600
Lan Xin,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.680
Aunt, do you remember me?

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.640
Yes, you are Lan Tian's sister.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.240
So do you work here?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.160
Everything goes well?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.040
Just so so.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.240
It's so good to have Cha
Cha here to help me.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.920
You mean Cha Cha？

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.640
Your friend is still waiting.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.440
I just forgot about him.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.120
Aunt, why don't you drink some tea?
Take care.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I will visit you later.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
That's very nice of you.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
Let's go.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.240
Cha Cha,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.960
Why did she say you helped her a lot?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.800
Eh~

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.720
I am just helping her manage this resort.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.920
I gotta be paid for my work.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400
That's good.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.960
You can often see Lan Tian here.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.680
And your problem

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.920
can be resolved soon.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.320
Then we have to stay here.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.920
It's too hot.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.320
Aren't you curious about what

00:04:22.321 --> 00:04:23.800
Bai Yongze has been busy with?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.080
This costs too much.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.600
You may never have your loved one back.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.720
Thanks for your news.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.680
Walk yourself out, please.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.880
Good night.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.560
As long as I catch this big fish,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.240
all news will come to me

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:09.800
will come to me itself

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960
Got it.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840
Watch out!

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200
Happy?

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.000
Happy! This is so beautiful, the beach.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
True.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.520
Thanks for understanding me!

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.800
I have to thank you

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.680
for believing me

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.600
and tellling me your story.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.360
Angel, where r u?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.839
You think I will tell you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.999
I am on the beach

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.160
in bikini and under the sun bathing?

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.600
Bikini!

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.880
Running on the beach?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.120
I just want everybody relaxed.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.720
And change the environment for good moods

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.480
What do you say?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.720
Come on

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.479
Beach beach

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.520
Go go

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.720
Let's go.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.279
Angel, angel.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280
That sounds familiar.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Angel.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920
He is really here?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.160
Angel.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.440
Angel.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.479
Perfect.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.520
What a good shape of the figure!

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I might leave first

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Wait.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.920
Let's hang out after training!

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.120
That is what I think.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.560
Stay for my dream, please!

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960
Stay

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960
Just stay.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.560
He is just

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.560
complicated.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.440
Cha Cha

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.880
Song Cha cha

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.680
Where is she?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.120
Where?

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.880
Why are you so mean?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
So what?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.040
You shouldn't just sneak away.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.800
Sorry,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.640
It was so embarassing to be there.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
Why?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.720
Because of your ex?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.240
You said you

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.040
felt nothing about him.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.880
Who is coming?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
Making this so grand?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.200
Yeah!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.120
Who is coming?

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280
It would be great

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.600
if I could stay here.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080
Hey, look

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.560
Isn't this Song Chacha?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.200
You are working here?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.240
It's more considerate than I imagine.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.360
Caring about ex's life

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.040
is really

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.440
noble.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.800
Song Chacha.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.720
Hey, guys, this is Bai Yongze.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600
And these are my friends.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.320
You do have so many this kind of friends.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.040
Then who you think

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.120
is worth being Lan Tian's friend?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600
At least,

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.640
The one with a head.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.680
Stop it, cheers.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.600
The manager asked me to check here.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.120
Yeah, I asked you here.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.040
We were sort of

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.440
friends.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.440
Song Chacha was a figure at that time.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.840
And it's hard to ask her out.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.640
We finally have this opportunity

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.640
to get together.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080
And you must

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.800
miss this kind of reunion, right?

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160
Cha Cha,

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.400
come on, have a drink.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720
Thank you so much,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.560
but I am different from

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.800
you these aristocrats.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200
I have no time for this.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.040
You really think

00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:31.521
you are still that precious princess?

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.680
Your time is of no value.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.520
I pay you twice.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120
Is that enough?

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.320
Take it to cure your illness.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.760
Take it to cure my illness?

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720
Just drink.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.360
Why did manager want me to send the phone?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.520
Where the hell is he?

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Give it to me.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
Hey, what are you doing?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Stay away from me.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.360
What Lan Tian can't give you, I can

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.000
Be my girlfriend, Cha Cha.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.320
I dared not love you because
you were above my position.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.640
But I can totally feed you now.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040
You are a pysco.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.520
She can't be your girlfriend.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.200
Because she is my girlfriend.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400
Let's go.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.880
Things of one kind come together.!

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.840
You should know that

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.560
the Song Chacha you abandoned

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.800
was already picked by him.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480
Shut up.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920
Shut the fuck up.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.520
Lan Tian, that's enough

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.680
Get off me, I will kill you today.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.680
Lan Tian, that's enough

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.280
You will kill him.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.160
Phaethon

00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:38.440
is the son of Apollo

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.480
One day

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.759
he wants to

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.000
show off to his friends.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.719
So he asks his father

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.040
to let him ride on his chariot.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.440
And Apollo agrees

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.319
and tell him not to ride too low

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.640
also not too high.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.240
It must be in the middle.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.920
But,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.200
Phaethon doesn't listen to his father.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.240
The chariot is out of traces

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.760
and burns all the crops.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.720
The name of the chariot

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.479
is...

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.440
Shut the fuck up.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440
Desire.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.920
Lan Tian, that's enough

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.400
I will kill you today.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.759
You will kill him.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.280
Desire is terrible.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.400
So if you grow up

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.080
and have something you really want,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.600
never out of track.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.080
Do what you can, OK?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.800
OK.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.120
Do you understand?

00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.600
Understood.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.200
His head is bleeding

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.110
just truma.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.560
It's not deadly.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.590
But,

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.070
he has concussion.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.440
He needs rest.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.520
And his arm broken.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.880
Are you out of your mind?

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.880
What that broken-down woman is?

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.440
She is nothing but a loser.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.480
Watch your mouth!

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.560
He is not himself right now.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.280
Let's just go. Don't get
ourselves in trouble.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.800
Lan Tian!

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.120
Shut the fuck up

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.400
if you don't want trouble.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.560
Even so,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.880
It's not true about

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.680
what I said.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.520
Are you innocent or stupid?

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.520
You really think I believe that?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.120
Do you know about her?

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.520
No matter what,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.160
i f she wants something,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.440
even just a pencil,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.200
she won't give it up.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.520
Understand?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.680
Have you heard of this song?

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.720
No.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.360
It's a song of Plein soleil

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.079
It tells a story that

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.040
a guy who stole his
friend's money and woman

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.760
ended up declining.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.480
It warns us not to steal

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.520
or you will get punished.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.560
Right from start,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.400
there is something that
you shouldn't lokk at,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.280
or your life will be messed up.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.759
Sorry, the call you dialed is not
answered for the time being,

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.160
please redial later.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.480
Why didn;t he pick up?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.880
Something happened?

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120
Even it is,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640
I can't be that reckless to ask

00:21:25.641 --> 00:21:27.120
what happened to Lan Tian.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840
Is he asleep?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.399
I am sorry if

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.920
woke you up.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640
He can't be asleep

00:21:40.641 --> 00:21:41.800
for what hppened today?

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.960
Why didn't you answer my phone?

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.200
Deliberately?

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.960
Is that too mean?

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.920
I'd like to ask you something.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.720
What?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
It's that..

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.080
You?

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.640
When are you here?

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.400
If I woke you up...

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960
I

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.400
Come on in.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.760
What do you want to say?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.560
How is that friend?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.600
Is he awake?

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.480
Why do you care about him

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.480
after what that asshole did to you?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.000
Are you that serious?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.600
Is Lan Tian OK?

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.160
He is fine.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.160
Don't be so worried.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.360
Wonderful!

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.800
Wonderful? Who do you mean?

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.160
That friend? Or Lan Tian?

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.759
Why are you so mad about me?

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.760
Why not?

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.319
You must have done somthing and le that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.320
guy take advantage of you.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.599
I wonder how much

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.080
you can take.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.960
Some people just like to
differentiate others.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.080
They will look down on those

00:23:18.081 --> 00:23:19.120
who is worse.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.240
And I am a woman.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.959
So I should be to blame

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.520
for everything.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.680
Yeas, you are right.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.559
And why do you care if I am easily

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.640
taken advantage of?

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
You are damn right

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.280
Because this has nothing to do with me,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.280
then,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.560
don't get involved in my life.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.360
And don't you show up in front of my face.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.119
I am begging you to

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.799
leave and disappear from now on.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.800
Right now.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:33.840
Lan Tian, let her go, that's not love.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.880
It's not true about

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120
what I said.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.440
Are you innocent or stupid?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.480
You really think I believe that?

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.880
Do you know about her?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600
No matter what,

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.200
i f she wants something,

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.440
even just a pencil,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.400
she won't give it up.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.960
You are damn right

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.080
Because this has nothing to do with me,

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.880
then,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.320
Don't you show up in front of my face.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.079
I am begging you to

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.759
leave and disappear from now on.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760
Right now.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.200
You are way too much.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.600
I got fired?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.480
There must be a mistake.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.720
So what is the reason that

00:26:39.721 --> 00:26:41.240
you wane me to leave so sonn?

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:45.160
宋茶茶小姐 你好像忘了

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.320
You job is to clean the room.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.000
Not guest himself.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.520
What do you mean?

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.960
Seriously? I tell you why.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.440
A guest witnessed

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.640
you, Miss Song,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.159
walked into

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.680
Bai Yongze's room.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.440
I did that because of

00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:06.960
something.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.320
I am innocent.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.240
But you were wearing uniforms,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.000
and you were a server of us.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.240
Do what you should do.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.800
Am I right?

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280
Song Chacha.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.800
You want a reason?

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:27.560
Because every stuff of our resort

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.720
of our resort

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.520
feels ashamed.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.720
I didn't do anything that I am ashamed of.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.240
I won't leave for this

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.720
ridiculous reason.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.040
I won't accept it.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.600
I will report in

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.040
no matter what the results are.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.200
It's your freedom to report in

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.239
But if you do that with that

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.200
ridiculous reason.

00:27:52.201 --> 00:27:53.720
I will sue you for defamation.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.960
I believe you know that clealy.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.480
Truth is truth.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.279
We are not your

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.600
puppets.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.360
Where does your justice come from?

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.120
You have balls ha?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.480
Just leave.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.040
Lan Tian is not enough for you

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.640
and you went to seduce Yong Ze?

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.960
Just say it

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.319
taht you are jealous.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.880
Are you shy?

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.160
Let go of me. Let go.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.960
Why did you do that?

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.600
What if you get excluded

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.359
because of me?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.480
If I were in this situation,

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.120
I might just leave it. But
you are my only friend,

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.360
what else can I do?

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.000
And the most important,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.160
you looked so cool.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.440
Especially when you said

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.640
'We are not your peppets'

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.519
If he fires me

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520
because of this,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.240
he will do that to other people.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.640
I really wanted to kich the door and

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800
walked out of that door.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.640
But I have no luck.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.160
God knows how I have
gone throught all this.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.960
Why do we have to compete?

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.280
You can do your conversion fluently

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.080
can't you?

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.520
That's why we have two teams.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.160
Right?

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.896
Just take it as a fun before simming meet.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.640
OK, Lan Tian?

00:29:37.641 --> 00:29:39.120
As long as I am not in your team.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.720
Of course

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.680
I am with my Yong Ze.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.840
I dare you.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.880
I will not be in your team.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.360
Neither am I

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.760
We are a team? We are a team?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.160
I really don't want to leave this behind.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.440
Lan Tian, on your knees, apologize.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.360
What if I can't.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.800
If you know

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.480
who your father is working with,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.920
would you still say that?

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.520
You did this to me,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.040
and I almost have concussion.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.720
What would he think

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.480
if he knows?

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440
It doesn't matter!

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.920
So it is with Song Chacha?

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.960
Itdoesn't matter if I play with her?

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.400
Why is it cncerned with her?

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.880
We are already here.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Why do you bully her?

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160
Shame on you.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.400
Shit.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.880
Do you know who I am?

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.520
Bluffing?

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.240
I am telling you to

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.320
apologize for Lan Tian.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.040
Now!

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.120
I will do that.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.760
It's all because of me.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.520
Is that what you want?

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.880
Don't do that!

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.640
Behave yourself, you brat

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.320
Stop, stop.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600
Lan Tian.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.480
I can kneel before you.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520
You can

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.720
just beat it back.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
Come on.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.720
Stop when you want to!

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.360
You think I won't?

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.960
You asshole!

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.560
Stop Lan Tian!

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.800
I told you to stop.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.680
Carefull, OK?

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Sorry, sorry

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.600
You don't want to go tohospital?

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.080
Take a day off, it doesn't matter

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.480
It's no big deal.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.480
You should just rest.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.840
He just walked away?

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960
Cold-blood guy.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.520
Anyway, I am here

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.520
taking care of you with my heart.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840
What about your training?

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.080
Skip it!

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.039
What a great opportunity

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.280
to stay with my idol.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.400
Go training

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.400
Now!

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.680
OK, OK

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.160
I will be back when I am finished.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.720
What else do you need?

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.800
Anything except you.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440
OK

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
Get out.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.120
Hey, what are you doing?

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.680
Get off me.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.600
Why did you cry?

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.520
Who do you want to go crazy?

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.080
I feel comfortable to see you.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920
Just go.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.520
I am far from comfortable.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.440
I will figure it out

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.280
if it is money.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.080
Who will work for money

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.360
in front of her boyfriend?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.560
Then why are you doing this?

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.320
I want you to see me like this

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.320
and I want you to feel guilty
for the rest of your life.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.240
Even you don't love me,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.840
at least I want you to fell guilty.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.720
That's fair

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.400
But I don't want this

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.360
anymore.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.400
Because none of this works.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.360
So I just want to leave.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.190
First Zhao Yan didn't want me to go.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.879
Then the rumors.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.920
They force me to stay.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.080
And...

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.760
Don't say a word.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.879
The test is coming soon?

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.360
Fight?

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.520
What were you doing when the fighr started?

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.040
Where is your team spirit?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.680
Stop it or call the police!

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.320
Sir, that's between privileged children

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.800
We just...

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.560
You don't care about their resentment!

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
Why did you take their drinks?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.400
Lan Tian, listen up!

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.880
Even this is your resort.

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.760
I want you to remember that

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880
it's not allowed any personal issues

00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.199
in my team?

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.720
Do you understand?

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840
I am sorry, sir

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.800
And you

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.880
It's all done

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.216
no matter how hard you practice

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:09.640
You get injured before the meet?

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.200
It's all gone.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480
Yes, sir.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.120
Next time? None of you will
take part in contests.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.400
Yes, sir.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800
Go on your training.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.040
Song Chacah, I am afraid.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.200
I am afraid 'Bai Yongze '
comes out of your mouth.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.280
Lan Tian, what are you doing?
You are shaking?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.440
Concentrate, please!

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.440
What's wrogn with?

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.040
You were doing great.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.160
Why is this?

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.400
Put it on!

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760
Hello?

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.320
Can you make porridge
with sliced thin pork?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.040
Porridge with sliced thin pork?
What do you want?

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.040
Yong Ze isnot feeling well.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.880
I want to make him one.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.400
I am excellent at that.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.600
See you in an hour.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:31.800
Deal.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.080
What a long day!

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.200
Can you make porridge
with sliced thin pork?

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.720
No, but I read about it in abok, why?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.320
Hey, where are we going?

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.680
Can we use this kitchen?

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.680
I just told

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.480
the aunt.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Alright.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.199
But why are we making

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.160
that?

00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:12.400
For Yong Ze!

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.680
It's said that he doesn't feel dood.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.320
It's my chance to

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.560
show him off

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.160
But how is that making?

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.960
Eh~ I will help you do that.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.840
But there are no preserved eggs,
let's make porridge with abalone

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.560
Abalone is full of vitamins and minerals

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.280
and helps improve immunity.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.240
The shell is so hard.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.240
We need to remove the shell.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:03.200
Cooking is so terrible!

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560
Almost done.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.960
What's wrong with you?

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.480
I seem to eat too much.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.000
Oh! I need to go to the infirmary.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.440
Give that to Jiang Shi when he comes.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.640
Where is my angel?

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.360
She's sick and in infirmary.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.760
Infirmary?

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.720
My angel!

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.840
Why did run?

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.920
Did you come here for porridge?

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.400
Do you know who leaked the video?

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.080
No, not intersted.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.120
I did.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.680
You know why?

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.640
I can sacrifice everything for you

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.680
even my reputation.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.880
Don' you feel a thing?
