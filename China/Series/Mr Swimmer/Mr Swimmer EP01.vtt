Despite what an intense competence
it is going to be today,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.120
he seems pretty calm and relaxed.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.279

be first bright leader

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.239

You must be very excited

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.520

00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:06.920
May I ask who you want to share this with

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.440
With someone very important

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.920
Who is the one?

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.520
It's you.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.480
You are watching? This is for you.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.960
You crazy

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.920
Wow... be a lady, OK?

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.960
You don't want to be with me?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.720
What if someone had known
about the relationship?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.096
I thought you were gonna
announce our relationship.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.120
So scared

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.720
When did I say you were my girlfriend?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.320
I, Bai Yongze, the most favored,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.200
got to be picky about choosing a girlfriend

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.040
Are you shy?

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.380
You know what,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.040
this head is really expensive

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.580
and i got an insurance for it

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.920
Li Bao,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.400
drive the car away as soon as i get off.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.440
What’s wrong?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.940
See you in the vally

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.600
There is your sweetheart,.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.980
But I already knew that

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.680
When did you fall in love with each other?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.900
What do you want?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.040
What am i doing?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.540
Help you get the headline. Have a look

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.960
If I see you again,

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.870
it isn't the camera smashed on the ground

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.220
you have nothing to be proud of

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.240
Fuck

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.400
Now welcome our main guest
this evening, Bai Yongze.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.680

star in the world.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.600
How are you doing?

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.040
Oh, Mr Lan, what’s up

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.800
Absolutely in the school’s library

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.040
What is the noise?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.640
I am in the restaurant of the library.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.720
Ah, I got an emergency,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.000
I gotta go, bye mom

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.200
Seriously, again?

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.700
Do your job

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.320
Yes, sir

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.940
Welcome

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.560
oh, isn't this Song Chacha?

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.020
It seems you are really broke.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.940
With no money for your postgraduate recommendation,
you poor thing come here to be a waitress.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.020
Who is the pathetic one?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.520
Of course the ones who can't
graduate in senior year

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.240
or the one who gets the first
class honour in thesis defense?

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.839
So what with the first?

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.640
You don't have enough
money for your tuition.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.120
We, are going to America

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.560
I have lived the seedy life.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.536
If there were nothing that
happened to my family,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.759
I might still have been the one

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.399
who can't even take care
of myself just like you.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.920
If you haven't decided your order yet,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.400
I will come back later.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.140
Wait, I heard that you
were discarded by Lan Tian

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.680
Oh, sorry to let you down.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.999
If I am dumped, you will
be the first one to know.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.339
If you like him,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.380
go for it.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.760
It’s just

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.760
he is not interested in you this type

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.360
What a stupid girl! We will see!

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.660
Wipe this out!

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.140
Wipe this! Are you a deaf?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.279
Excuse me, sorry

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.280
What’s going on?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560
See for yourself

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.380
I am so sorry

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.420
Song Chacha

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.660
Wait, i heard that you
were discarded by Lan Tian

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.320
Sorry, the number you dialed
is not in the service

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.360
I hate you, Lan Tian

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960
bye bye

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.040
OK, look at you

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.520
Do you really understand
what I feel about you?

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.680
Does it seems that I don't understand?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.280
Then, prove it

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.360
Kiss me here

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.560
Bai Yongze

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.280
We are in the middle of talk here

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.760
Who do you think you are, man?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.440
What kind of bullshit you
tried to pull your string?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.040
Hey, don't be a loser.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.600
Do you know the real one
is contesting in the pool?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320
Yong Ze

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.320
Stop, I am warning you

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880
Get off me

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.679
Why don't you just go back home
and look at yourself in a mirror,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.160
then ask yourself 'why did you lose'.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.880
Maybe because I am better

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720
Better?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.240
Better? better than who?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.240
You are just a bastard
without your parents.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.120
What did you say?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
Yes, I said it.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.720
Everybody, this guy's dad only adopted him

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.280
to make a swimmer.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.520
You ain’t shit. Let me
tell you something, buddy.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.080
Your parents don't love you, just like a
little dog, nowhere to go, nowhere to be.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.840
So dogie, sit,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.240

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.560

he was attacked by Bai

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.760
He started it

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840
What?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240
Rumor?

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.240
Who wrote this?

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.560
A guy named Xu?

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.520
Mom, I have a party tonight,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.160
I will come back later.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680
Hey, bring me an ashtray

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.640
You heard that?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240
Eh

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.350
Eh, I have a sober party tonight

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.590

Oh, I am sorry, no smoking here.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.000
No smoking? What nonsense! You crazy?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.590
Are you out of your mind?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.350
I...

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.110
Song chacha

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.920
I said I will contact you.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.536
It's inappropriate for you
to come to my working place.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:36.920
Let’s go outside

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
When

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.799
Why do you ask me for money

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.256
I can't find your uncle.
Who am I to ask for?

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280
Who am I to ask for?

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.600
When! when will you pay

Penalties?

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.080

I got maligned at first. Why do I do that?

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.760
Why? Swimming.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.800

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.880
we are here to apologize

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.359
No need

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.340
even so i won't change my mind

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.120
even so i won't change my mind

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.880
Yong Ze is a grateful child.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.960
Please give him one more chance

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.400
What a great father,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.560
always believe in his son

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.380
Ha ha, you are right

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.920
I invested

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.800
because i trusted my son to much

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.520
Please, sir

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680
Enough

00:19:17.681 --> 00:19:19.240
Enough. Go home just.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.200
Sir

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.799
If you want me to kneel down

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.159
I will do it.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.240
Dad

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280
enough, stop

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.420
I don't want to continue my career this way

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560
I am telling you

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.080
I don't want a child who don't want to swim

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.080
I am telling you

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.520
I don't want a child who don't want to swim

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.640
Let go of me,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.800
I would have never done
this job if I had known it

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800
if I had known it

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.320
go

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320
Let go of me

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.080
Let go of me

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.160
You have come this far, you
think you have a choice.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320
Fine

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.120
I go

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200
I go

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.800
Just behave

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.480
Come here

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.240
You

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.879
check the dance floor

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.280
, keep you eyes on it

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.840
You go to the back door, watch on it

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.240
Song Chacha, stop right there

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.760
You that way, you go this way with me

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160
Song Chacha, come out right now

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400
Who are you?

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.800
Song Chacha, come out right now

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.560
You are dead if catch you

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.760
I am asking who you are

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.440
Sir, help me please

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.400
Song Chacha

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480
Thank you

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.560
Wear this

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.800
You will never walk out
that door with this dress

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.520
Bai Yongze is thrown out of Jet star

00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:37.320
for good

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.639
At the same time,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.160
It's reported that he is dating
with an actress named Li Bao

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.360
Who is that? It's midnight

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.120
You! You got so drunk

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.616
You come here at this time to

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.120
take me down with you?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.520
You seem not happy to see me

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.200
I heard that the club
is going to dismiss you

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
What are you going to do?

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.320
There is nothing I can
do except for swimming?

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.360
I think I might be an actor

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.200
You are nothing if you don't swim

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.000
if you don't swim

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.600
Wait, you want to count on me?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.840
I am just a new actress

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.736
There is no chance for us to survive

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.880
to survive

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.800
Right

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.080
Delete pictures of me

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.760
Well, forget it, I will do it

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.080
Where is your phone?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.320
I think it's lost

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.760
What?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280
Lost?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.960
What if people find the photos?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.400
I am gonna ask you only one question

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.080
do you love me only when i am on
stages to receive the honour?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.800
Fine

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.040
You must find your phone

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.319
Lan Tian, this

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.680
may be the darkest day of my life.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.440
I feel abandoned

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.600
by the whole word

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.440
Yong Ze, don't lose your heart

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.320
Things may not be as terrible as you think.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.000
No matter what happens,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.360
I am on your side

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760
So

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.839
So, take back what you said about

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.880
Withdrawing investment on Bai Yongze

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.600
I have made my mind

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.720
It’s not your business

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.200
Then we can make a deal

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.560
A deal?

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.880
Fine

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.400
What’s your leverage?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.600
Leverage? Enough

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.160
And I have a condition

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.600
what is your leverage?

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.040
I want to restart swimming

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.080
Nonsense

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.880
You are my heir of my company

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.760
Are you out of your mind?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.080
So I am making a deal with you

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.319
Alright, show me what you got

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.656
And I will decide if I want to do it

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.000
You must know what date
it will be in a few days

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.160
You stop me from swimming.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.840
I will get married to
Song Chacha as promised

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.200
what?

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.240
You will pay all Song’s dept

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.360
According to previous agreement,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.000
What do you think?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560
What do you think?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.600
You are ..what?

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.719
A tough guy ha

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.040
How dare you!

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.160
So, do you accept it or not?

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.120
Fine, accepted

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.040
on conditions that:

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.520
I will invest on this team

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.040
Ok, I take it as a yes.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.280
I will meet my lawyer when i am back

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.040
and I will turn the resort
my grandpa left for me

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.280
into a training base.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.480
If I don't take care of Song Chacha,

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.640
she will be like poison.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.160
Every time I think of

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.880
You being sad because
your loss of your father

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.280
I am as sad as you are

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.320
I know whatever I say cannot comfort you

00:28:06.321 --> 00:28:08.200
cannot comfort you

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.080
I hope you will think of me, be strong.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.000
You just left without any explanations

00:28:16.001 --> 00:28:17.521
You just left without any explanations

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880
Who am I to you?

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120
Hello

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.360
I am the owner of this phone

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920
Who are you

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.640
The girl you just met in the
bar and wore your jacket

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.320
and wore your jacket

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.400
That bulb

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.400
Bulb?

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880
You can have the jacket

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.320
Can you give me my phone?

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.440
Absolutely, yes

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.600
Can I give it to you tomorrow?
It's too late.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.280
Hello?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480
Hello?

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.480
Hello? No signal?

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.520
How can you be an agent?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.800
You get up so later than I do

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240
You don't remember?

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.880
You were drunk when you came back

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.640
I cleaned you up. And I was very tired.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.280
I got home myself?

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.560
Yeah

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.120
Absolutely, yes

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.080
Can I give it to you tomorrow?
It's too late.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.520
Phone! Your phone!

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.360
Come on! Come on!

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200
Lan Tian

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240
Hello

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.640
It can't be Chacha

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.240
Hello

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.160
Hello

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.240
Hello, bulb

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.160
Why did you take my phone?

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.920
Why was the line busy?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.600
You know a guy named Lan Tian?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.840
You went through my phone?

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.936
How can I be that kind of person?

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.760
I say

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.320
Take my phone and give it to me

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.640
My address is...

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:46.840
Hello

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880
Hello

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.440
Battery is dead

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.160
I thought you were nice

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.760
Such an asshole

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760
Hello

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.360
This is Lan Tian's father

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
Uncle Lan

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.760
Hello, what’s up. She hung up?

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.640
Sorry! The subscriber you
dialed is powered off

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.400
powered off

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.040
getting married

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.400
Yeah, getting married

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.256
I know you have a promise between

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.600
You and Lan Tian

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.680
And he mentioned that

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.200
He wants to fulfil it

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.240
That promise? I am sure he won't forget it.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.640
Ok

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.280
So

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.176
I recently know that you
lost contact with him

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.480
you lost contact with him

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.920
It’s probably because of his mother

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.960
That he ignored you

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.320
Now that he put it on board and

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.440
I found you

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.080
So let's get this done

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320
What do you say?

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.320
Wait! Uncle Lan

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.120
I think it's too fast

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.040
We haven't contacted each
other for a few years

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.680
You don't want to see him?

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.200
It's true that this is ridiculous

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.320
And I do think so

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.920
But, I know my son, he is so stubborn

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.520
If he wants to get something
done, it must be done

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.320
I can do nothing about it

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.560
Cha cha, i think we shouldn't

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.240
tell your mom about the wedding

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.200
After all, she is not
aware of some accidents

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.440
that happened to your
family for her amnesia

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.039
If your father doesn't show up

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.640
in your wedding, she might break down

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.640
she might break down

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.000
Therefore, I think

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.960
You two young couple just get it done

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.710
We will have a ceremony

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.840
when you mom gets better

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.600
Eh... does Lan Tian come back?

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560
I'd like to see him first

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.880
His words are that

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.860
he goes straight to you for wedding.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.760
It seems he has planed this for a century.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.280
So weird.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.000
Promise me

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.630
No matter what happens we will get married

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.680
We will get married

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.800
What if we break up before that?

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.440
Even you don't love me, I still do

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.800
Even if there is some kind
of mistakes blocking us,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.840
I will come for you on the day

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.440
when we promise

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.560
to get married.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.240
Just promise me, OK?

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.240
A promise is a promise.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.760
I guess the answer will
show up when I see him

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.560
You can't do this

00:36:08.561 --> 00:36:09.639
Can I give back your money later

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.679
I will return your money. I have money

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.159
I spend all my money on swimming equipment

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.639
That one

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.719
Look, I bought this

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.119
These goggles man's goggles and hats

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.639
Look, I bought these. there is no money

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.039
You know the story of goggles man?

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:21.600
I tell you

00:36:21.601 --> 00:36:22.999
the man who wears goggles man wins champion

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.560
our players are great

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.136
You will regret it when we get championship

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.000
Just give us a chance

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.880
Just give us a chance

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.360
That’s pretty cool.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.079
What? No

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.200
Why are you being a jerk?

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.840
I will give you money

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.960
No is a no

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280
Oh my gosh

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.760
My idol Bai Yongze

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.080
got dismissed

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.400
Are you done?

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.480
We are the ones who get dismissed

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.280
Quiet

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.160
Please reconsider it, OK

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:57.620
Coach Huang

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:58.800
No

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480
How you doing?

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.400
I am Lan Tian, remember?

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.160
You... look at you

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.560
Lan Tian

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.320
as for payment

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.440
Just relax, i will treat you right

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.240
You really want to be an athlete?

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.319
I thought it was

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.600
A joke or something

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.800
Then, have you decided?

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.600
How can I say no

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.399
when I can't even pay my rent?

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.720
Alright, i take it as a yes

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.480
There is one condition: I have a friend

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.040
And I want you to take care of him

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640
Friend?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.400
Stop kidding. What’s the hurry?

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.200
I said I come back because of business

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.360
I almost believe it,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.400
you must miss me

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.480
Your company decided

00:38:05.481 --> 00:38:07.520
to continue investing on your training

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080
What

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.480
And I will start swimming again

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.200
What did you do to your father?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.079
Did you sign some creepy

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.680
contract with him?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040
Much creepier

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560
Much creepier?

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:34.480
Hey, Lan Tian

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.480
Bastard, he tricked me

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.400
What? He left his phone here

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:09.760
Almost forgot mine

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.280
Lan Tian? This is your surprise?

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.080
What surprise?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:35.520
So?

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.640
You want to cheat on someone again?

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.080
Lan Tian? Is him with you?

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.560
You said Lan Tian last time?

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.320
You know him?

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.360
I am asking whether that
asshole is with you

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.360
What? Asshole?

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.280
What's your name?

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.280
Song Chacha

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.420
Lan Tian do you know Song Chacha?
