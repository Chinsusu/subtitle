00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
[Episode 12]

2
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,840
How about this one

3
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
Why don't you use their Soup

4
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,920
It tastes bad

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,800
It's full of monosodium gluatemate

6
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
And I like soup

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,360
How about I make you one?

8
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,880
You made this?

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
What if it doesn't taste good?

10
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Let me show you a rope

11
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,560
As long as the ingredients are fresh enough

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
they taste grate

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Even if you're not good at cooking

14
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
And I think cooking for others

15
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,560
is a great skill

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,360
You understand?

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,520
What's up

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,960
Please pay attention to your image, okay?

19
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,440
Is the soup ready?

20
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,160
Let me taste it, what did you put in the soup

21
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Not good?

22
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,200
This soup is really good

23
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
What did you put in the soup

24
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,440
The magic?

25
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,280
I put some seafood in it

26
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,600
Haven't you ever had sefood soup?

27
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,720
Why I always thinking the kiss?

28
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
It's really delicious

29
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
I can be a cook

30
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,560
Are the other cooks dead?

31
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,959
First of all,the ingredients are good

32
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,160
The most importang is

33
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,280
that there's a lady-killer next to you

34
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,840
And exuding an enchanting breath

35
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
That's why the soup tastes good

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,160
Are the other lady-killers dead?

37
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Me?

38
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,440
Yongze

39
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Your friend Bai Yongze let me tell you

40
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Not worth mentioning in your life

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm working here

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
To comletely forget you

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,520
This is a nice place

44
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,680
Song Cha

45
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,240
Song Cha, Song Chacha

46
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
Lan Tian mistook you for Song Chacha?

47
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,600
Lan Tian, I got it

48
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,040
Unfortunately, you fired Chacha

49
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,880
An unfortunate woman

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,120
Jiang Shi?

51
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,920
Say what?

52
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,320
Are you going to land training?

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,600
What the hell are you talking about?

54
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,160
Why am I going to land training?

55
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,440
Why told me that?

56
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
Does he miss me?

57
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,280
What a pitiful man Yongze is!

58
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
They are going to land training

59
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,960
Why are we going there

60
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,160
We're going there

61
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
so you can see Lan Tian

62
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,960
Nah

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,880
While your fake boyfriend

64
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,360
is still here

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
Go ahead

66
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Maybe it's the last day

67
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160

71
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,680
Are you leaving tomorrow?

72
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Tell me,are you?

73
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,800
Where are they

74
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
You're not gonna tell me?

75
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,240
Well, I'll go tomorrow

76
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
I found a sponsor

77
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,480
So, today is the last day

78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,080
to be your fake boyfriend

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,480

80
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,400

81
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,240
What's wrong?

82
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,000
My foot hurt,I canlt walk

83
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Wake up, Lan Tian

84
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
That's waht you want

85
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,880
She has gone

86
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,000
That's what you want

87
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,800
Look out

88
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,200
Here we are

89
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,320

90
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,320
What's that

91
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,200
Fireflies

92
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
There are no fireflies in the city

93
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Except here

94
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
When night falls, we can see it

95
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,440
I see it for the first time

96
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,400
Song Chacha

97
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160

98
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,040
On Valentine's Day

99
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,200

101
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,440
If you feel stressed

102
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,360
You can refuse

103
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,200

104
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,880
How do you know my size

105
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,480
I won't tell you

106
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,080
I'm going to show Lan Tian off

107
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,400

111
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,760
The lamp's fixed

112
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,240
Really?

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,320
Who

114
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,440
Who fixed it?

115
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,520
I can't believe it

116
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,720
It's said that

117
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,000
the lamp

118
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
was fixed by a moron who wasn't afraid of death

119
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,120
And then the moron fell off

120
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,520

124
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,760
Lan Tian took me to dinner

125
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,800
I haven't visited in a long time

126
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,960

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,320

152
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,040

She accept a strange movie

162
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,600
It's said that she was dressed outrageously  in the film

163
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,800
And the movie might be a porn

164
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,080
She accept it

165
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,760

169
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
No,no,no

170
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,800
It's Zhou..Zhou Xiaohu

171
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,320

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,520

I told Yongze's agent

176
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,840
My sister's life is ruined

177
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,440
Because of Bai Yongze

178
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,360

Don't be angry,sister

183
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,280
In my view,

184
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,520
Pu Jun is a loudmouth

185
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,600
who cannot be trusted with secret

186
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,400

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,720
I don't need sponsorship

196
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:24,439
Refuse it now

197
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,319
It soesn't matter,honey

198
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,319
I can do anything for you

199
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,920
To support me

200
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
so you can take the request

201
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,640
whatever it is

202
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,520
And dressing outrageously and posing pretentiously?

203
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,720
What are you thinking of?

204
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,720
Whatever, after the video thing

205
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm out of work

206
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,760
So, stop blaming yourself

207
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
You're the most important for me

208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,200
Refuse it

209
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
Right now

210
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,240
Honey

211
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,680
Answer me

212
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,320
I'll do what you told me

213
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,760
But could you come see me tomorrow?

214
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
I feel low

215
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,640
I'm out of work and my ex-boyfriend threathned me

216
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,680
I'll call you

217
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,600
I told you

218
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,320
Bai Yongze really treasured me

219
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,960
You are good

220
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Are you really gonna take it

221
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,520
For Bai Yongze?

222
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,520
Are you out of your mind?

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,640
I've always been pure, okay?

224
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,580
Even if they pay me hundreds of millions, I won't go

225
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,200
Hundreds of millions, for you?

226
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,960
You're not hot

227
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,960
I thought we found a dependency

228
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,520
So I spent all our money

229
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,600
What should we do now?

230
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,080
Are we going back home?

231
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,840
Fang Jingjing

232
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,240
God,Are you the Olympic champion FangJingjing?

233
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,520
Don't we talk for a second?

234
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm busy,sorry

235
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,880
Bai Yongze,do you like swim?

236
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,280
If you don't

237
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,320
Jist chasing for what you like

238
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
Or

239
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,760
No amount of effort is worth anything

240
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
What's the worth?

241
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,800
Just stories imposed in me

242
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,360
By those who envy me

243
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,240
Whatever you did before

244
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,960
That's all for

245
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
living up to what dreams have to do

246
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,160
If you really love it,you won't fail it

247
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,560
So you must find the answer

248
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
She is his fan

249
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:07,880
What?

250
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,800
You mean,the daughter of Jinxing Group's chairman's

251
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,160
is Bai Yongze's fan?

252
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,280
Looks like I'm going to the Hainan myself

253
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,200
You take Lan Tian and Bai Yongze

254
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,960
And we have dinner together

255
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,600
It's not fair to Song Chacha

256
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,880
If she goes, I'll go

257
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,280
That what you say

258
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,200
Okay

259
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,320
Just do what you want

260
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,640
God,I Drove him away

261
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
What should I do

262
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,640
All I know is that you begged him,

263
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,760
and he's coming back

264
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,640
Why should I beg him?

265
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,800
That's your business

266
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,000
But

267
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,320
You two are good friend

268
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,800
Good friend

269
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Don't think everything is

270
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,880
what it looks like

271
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,000
but

272
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,480
You two

273
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,760
are always together

274
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,120
What's wrong with you now?

275
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,280
Are you gus at loggerheads?

276
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,080
Are you?

277
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,600
How about me?

278
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,760
Are you kidding me?

279
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,600
Let me beg him?

280
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,280
That's what you should do

281
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,040
Look

282
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,240
I don't care whose fault it is

283
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,080
I won't beg him

284
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,440
But he is your teammate

285
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I don't need a teammate like him

286
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,720
Sorry

287
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,160
As a coach

288
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,520
You have no emotion

289
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,040
for your teammates?

290
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,200
No

291
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,760
Not even

292
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,680
a sense of responsibility?

293
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,280
No,

294
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,040
So

295
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,240
Please get away from here mow

296
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,160
If you don't, I'll go

297
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,240
I never expect you to be like this

298
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,680
Please,help me

299
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,560
If Bai Yongze doesn't come back,

300
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
I'll die

301
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,560
I can give you money,I can give you whatever you want

302
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,000
Then, then I promise to date you,okay?

303
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,400
What's you mean?I beg him

304
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,640
And I have to date you

305
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,360
Are you a gift to me?What's your logic?

306
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,520
Anyway

307
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,840
You must help me to find him back

308
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,200
Please

309
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,600
No

310
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay?

311
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,480
No, I told you

312
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Chach Huang

313
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,160
Would you knock it off?

314
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
To avoid misunderstanding

315
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,720
I don't want to ruin my reputation

316
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,160
Please, just the last time

317
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,120
Please, okay?

318
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,960
He said we were no longer in touch

319
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,880
What's wrong with him

320
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,480
Coach

321
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,200
I am about to aboard the plane

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,760
Just come to the point

323
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,880
What's the matter if you miss your flight

324
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,040
What?

325
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,560
Well,let me say this

326
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,560
There's a madman,not Lan Tian

327
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,080
Is Lan Tian's sister,Lan Xin

328
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
She asked me

329
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,360
to get you back

330
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,340
Not Lan Tian, is Lan Xin

331
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,760
I'm not a person

332
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,680
who do anything for others

333
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,360
But, her words

334
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Changed my mind

335
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,080
She asked me, as a coach

336
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,840
Do you have feelings

337
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
For your athletes?

338
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,080
It seems to question my attitude to my career

339
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,120
to my career

340
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,760
I recall the time when a was a player

341
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
I hoped I could have a coach

342
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,440
who concerned me

343
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,240
If I had

344
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,600
My life will be Better

345
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,360
Right?

346
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,160
So you means you want inject feelings into me

347
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,880
Not to you, but to me

348
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,120
I hope

349
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,480
I can put some emotion and enthusiasm

350
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,720
on my job

351
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,040
especially on someone like you

352
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
who is dawdling

353
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,520
having no idea of his limitations

354
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,240
but

355
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,160
gifted

356
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,040
I wanna try

357
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
So

358
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,200
Is that a declaration?

359
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm not your type

360
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,000
You don't have to be a prick,okay?

361
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,440
Ahyway

362
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,320
I told you

363
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,760
Just believe your choice.

364
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,840
I hope you can

365
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
challege yourself

366
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,080
I really hope so

367
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
Nana,here you are at last

368
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,360
How is everything

369
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,120
You must be exhausted

370
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,040
It's okay

371
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,800
There is beautiful

372
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,640
It's a feast for the eyes

373
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,400
Really,you should often come here

374
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,360
Our service is always ready for you

375
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:52,880

380
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,120
Okay

381
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,480
Bowing

382
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,560
Uncle Lan

383
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,640
Where is Bai Yongze's trained swimming pool

384
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Can I see him training?

385
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Of course

386
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
I'll arrange it for you

387
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,880
Thank you uncle Lan

388
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,800
Lan Xin

389
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,040
Go see what Bai Yongze's doing

390
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,840
Now?

391
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,720
Of course,when do you want

392
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,360
Okay.

393
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,560
It's great that you can come back

394
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,680
You still care about me

395
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,040
If you're coming back

396
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Why held the farewell party?

397
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,200
You've been gone a few times

398
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,800
THis isdn't a gotel

399
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm sorry to bother you

400
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,400
Lan Tian,did you get him back?

401
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,600
No,I didn‘t

402
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,960
If he will go,I feel relieved

403
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,840
Why si?

404
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,640
You must for DongChacha

405
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
No,I'm for coach

406
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,120
Coach Huang? That's impossible

407
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
You must for Song Chacha

408
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,760
How great is the power of love

409
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,080
Shut up

410
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,120
Bai Yongze

411
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
Hello,Bai Yongze, I'm your big fan

412
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,640
I'm so excited to see you

413
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,880
Really really excited

414
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,240
This is

415
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,640
the daughter of Jinxing Group's chairman's, Jin Nana

416
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,600
Hello

417
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,760
Hello

418
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:48,840
Hello

419
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,200
Nana

420
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
I wanted to invite you to dinner

421
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,720
And it's been delayed this day

422
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,600
Yeah

423
00:28:59,680 --> 00:28:59,960
Lan Tian

424
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,480
Are you an athlete now?

425
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,680
I thought you'd take over the uncle

426
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,600
I'm far away from

427
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,360
the professional athlete

428
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,200
And more far away from taking over my father

429
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm fine now at the resort

430
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,320
Bai Yongze,what's your point as a friend

431
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,840
I think Lan Tian has great potential

432
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,400
Yeah,I think so

433
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
So you two,must do your best

434
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,640
I'll go first

435
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,280
Wait, Bai Yongze

436
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,720
How's your reaining environment?

437
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,560
Anything you need?

438
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,960
Nana, you don't have to worry

439
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,560
Our training conditions here

440
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,600
are first-rate

441
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,760
Just go

442
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,480
Ah, I've got it

443
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,440
Uh-huh?

444
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
Let me show you arope

445
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,480
As long as the ingredients are fresh enough

446
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,920
they taste grate

447
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,880
Even if you're not good at cooking

448
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,120
And I think cooking for others

449
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,200
is a cool skill

450
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,040
You understand?

451
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,000
My personal chef

452
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,520
Bai Yongze is so famous

453
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
Doesn't the swimming star

454
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,800
have a private chef?

455
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,760
He does,of courese,he does

456
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,720
We're recruiting for him

457
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,920
A celebrity chef will be here

458
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
in a few days

459
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,160
Nah,I already have a choice

460
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,440
What?To be your private chef?

461
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,720
So you're not going to go away?

462
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,640
Yes, for some personal reasons

463
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,600
So do you agree?

464
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,360
You told me

465
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
cooking for others

466
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,200
is a cool skill

467
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,960
Yeah

468
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,880
But to be a private chef

469
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,120
I never learned to cook

470
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,920
I can only eat and identify ingredients

471
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,360
But It's too difficult to cook

472
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,240
Where are you taking me?

473
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:18,920
You

474
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,440
Why,why are you here

475
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,760
She is the person I want to employ

476
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,120
She?

477
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,160
Are you kidding me ?

478
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,880
She doesn't even have a certificate

479
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
How can she cook for you

480
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,560
I only want to employ her

481
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,960
Uncle Lan

482
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,080
Maybe she's got something unique

483
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,080
Just do what he want

484
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,200
Thanks for your understand

485
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,320
Okay,okay

486
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,360
To make you do this

487
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
is to respect Miss Nana's opinion

488
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,320
Well

489
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,760
Well let's go

490
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,400
Why make me so embarrassed

491
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,720
I don't want you to run and hide

492
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,000
Just face it bravely

493
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,840
They didn't put you in trouble

494
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
It's yourself

495
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,760
You look down on yourself

496
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,160
You have to think zbout your future

497
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,800
Maybe one day you'll like cooking

498
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,360
and become a famous cooker

499
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,440
or a dietician

500
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,000
Right?

501
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
I've told you so much

502
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm going to crying

503
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,680
Hey,I'm crying

504
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,600
Chacha

505
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,800
Uncle Lan

506
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,720
Do you know

507
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
the Bai Yongze's chef?

508
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,120
We've met several times

509
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,560
Do you know why I admire Bai Yongze?

510
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,040
Why

511
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,160
Because he's not as mean as I am

512
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,880
He has the courage I don't have

513
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
He is the only person

514
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,960
who makes me feel inferior

515
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,280
What

516
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,840
You employed Song Chacha?

517
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,920
Why didn't you  discussing it with me

518
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,840
before you making such a childish decision

519
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,840
I've made more childish decision

520
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,560
What decision

521
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,040
To make you my agent

522
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,560
You you

523
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,000
You know how it's to be your agent?

524
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
You fell in love with Song Chacha

525
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,520
I'm gonna help you hide it

526
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,040
And help you act

527
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
And worried about your trouble

528
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,639
I'm suffering a nervous breafdown

529
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,480
and can't sleep every night

530
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,280
Look, to cover the dark circles of the eyes

531
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,960
I wear sunglasses every day

532
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,639
I think

533
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,600
looks better with sunglasses

534
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,199
Nasty guy

535
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,800
Hello,sister

536
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm not your sister

537
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,120
Oh sorry

538
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,840
All I saw was your hair

539
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,680
How did your shopping go?

540
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,280
Now that I agreed to be your private chef

541
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm going to try

542
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,640
Be brave

543
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,640
Song Chacha

544
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,040
Are they sucked?

545
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,160
Is it for people?

546
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,440
Rea,really?

547
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,840
Oh,it's terrible

548
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,840
But I made it from recipe

549
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,880
Did I treat salt as sugar?

550
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,960
Did you treat Coke as soy sauce

551
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,880
I'm afraid so

552
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,040
You almost had me there

553
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,280
You told me you know the ingredients

554
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,880
What are these

555
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,040
I really know

556
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,480
I know

557
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,400
all the precious ingredients you tole me

558
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,640
Such bird's-nest

559
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I used to do a lot of research on food

560
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,920
But I never actually cook it

561
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
So I think

562
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,200
Cooking is a cool thing

563
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,840
God

564
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,400
I was cheated

565
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
So you can just eat,right?

566
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,200
But I can't just give up

567
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,760
I'll work hard

568
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,720
I shouldn't encourage you

569
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,160
After the test

570
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,960
We dicided to

571
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,840
send two people to the competition

572
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Bai Yongze and Lan Tian

573
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,680
Coach,I am not ready yet

574
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,200
You needn't reatd

575
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,440
You need experiments

576
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,000
According to the text

577
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,560
I don't think that's your best performance

578
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,800
Just enjoy the game,you know?

579
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
Can I not going?

580
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,160
Why

581
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,760
We had those plans

582
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
Who is within 1min and 55s,who is taking part

583
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,920
As for me

584
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,040
This is my chance to make a comeback

585
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,960
It's too important for me

586
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,440
At least

587
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,800
I have to compete in a race which is deserve

588
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,200
So, you think

589
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,360
It doesn't deserve you

590
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,400
in the race which Lan Tian  can take part in

591
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,840
I didn't mean it

592
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,600
So what's your mean

593
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,920
What the race

594
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,360
which is deserve

595
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
You did do well last time

596
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,760
But to be honest

597
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,720
You've been doing badly these days

598
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,680
You either lose your temper

599
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,080
or you fight

600
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,400
and affected your body

601
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,040
Okay

602
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,280
I'm gonna put you

603
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,320
in an international competition

604
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
and take part in 100m freestyle that is your best

605
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
How fast can you be?

606
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,040
So

607
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,320
the most important thing

608
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,320
is to test your training results

609
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,440
and

610
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,320
raise your self-confidence

611
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,280
Just keep in mind,stop showing off

612
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,800
Taking it step by step

613
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,040
Understand?

614
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,560
Okay

615
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:47,920

616
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,240
It semms like

617
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,760
Lan Tian,you really like freestyle

618
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,880
Finally, do you want to overtake me?

619
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,520
Come on

620
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,680

621
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,480

622
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,240
At this sxciting moment

623
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,680
I'm going to the bathroom

624
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,920
And

625
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,360
Don't speak tale of me

626
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,360
after I leave

627
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,600
Just leave

628
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Go

629
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,080
Keep in mind

630
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,320
Chacha

631
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,520
I employed Chacha as a private chef

632
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,520
Please don't mention her

633
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,720
She is your girlfriend now

634
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,960
But she has nothing to do with me

635
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,520
No matter why you hired her

636
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,280
It don't matter to me

637
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,680
The better it is

638
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,760
From where I stand

639
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,560
I have to mention it

640
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,600
Before you care about it

641
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,040
Just pay mor attention to the competition

642
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,160
So are you

643
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,200
Challenging me?

644
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,880
If not

645
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,160
I won't swim

646
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,640
So

647
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,120
Let me ask you for one thing

648
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,760
To  you.Am I your friend

You'll be my friend all the time

653
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,000

654
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,120

655
00:41:35,800 --> 00:00:00,000
