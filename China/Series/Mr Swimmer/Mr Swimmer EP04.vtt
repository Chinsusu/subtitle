00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.880
Lan Tian

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Lan Tian

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.120
He's out?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.240
Where can he go in the
minddle of the night?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
This is......

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.520
Hey, big guy

00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:26.440
Drinking time

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.720
What's this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.880
Lan Tian, I'm adrift and isolated

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Where are you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960
I never heard that he had a girlfriend

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.160
It must be fraud Email

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.360
I've received fraudulent emails before

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.680
Allow me

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.960
I'm so tired

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.160
I can't drink anymore

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280
What the hell?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.519
I forever am your patron god

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.016
To help you defend yourself from danger

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.440
Patron god?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880
Are you drunk?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.440
You will learn it in season

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.560
Bai Yongze is Lan Tian's patron god

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720
Are you crazy?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.070
I was crazy

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.600
Be his patron god

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.000
It's like stabbing him from back

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.640
Damn it

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.320
If you didn't reply my email

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.600
I was going to give up

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.240
If you kept ignoring me

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320
From beginning to end

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.360
Maybe we'll be different

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.400
Why gave me hope

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.840
Tell me what to do, Song Chacha

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.440
I gave her hope

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.800
Sorry, lamp bulb

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.080
How about Lan Tian

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480
Yeah, I was changed

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.080
My feelings for you have changed

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.480
So you broke your promise

00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:25.640
at the wedding

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.480
You just say it!

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.840
Afraid of me hunting you like a scoundrel?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.080
Now, It's up to you

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.120
If you can't handle it properly

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.840
For Chacha

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.840
ther will be no way out

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080
Lan Tian

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.680
I want to speak to you

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.240
Later

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.440
Some other time then

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.920
Anyway

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.240
You changed your mind

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240
Yeah

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.640
I changed my mind

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.640
Changed

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920
Where's Lan Tian

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.200
Lan Tian

00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:40.280
He doesn't seem well today

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.280
You're not qualified to speak for him

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.440
Training is not to be absent at will

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440
Lan Tian

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.840
Sorry

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:52.120
How are you

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.880
I'm fine

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:56.840
Then stand there

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.240
You've been overstretched

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.040
You need a break

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.760
Don't worry

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.920
Pay attention about your business

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.960
Yongze, I am disappointed

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.320
What?

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.440
I admire you so much

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.360
But you only care about him

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.360
I'm so disappointed

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.240
Lan Tian

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480
Lan Tian

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.880
Lan Tian

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.920
Why am I here

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480
You fainted on the ground

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.280
Doctor, is he just overtired?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.600
Yes, he is not sleeping poorly

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.840
Depression

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160
And muscles overwork

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.320
Just a massage

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.000
And cupping, He'll be fine.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.520
Okay, thank you doctor

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960
Well

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.480
Hold on, hold on

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.240
Are you crying?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.920
Easy, he is still alive

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.800
Welcome, Mr Lan

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.920
So many people

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.000
I'm not used to

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.320
shch a grand way

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200
Don't curtsy

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.360
Everybody

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.680
what is the matter?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.320
It seems I am not welcome by someone

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.640
He had a good relatongship
with the last president

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.400
So he must be unhappy

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.240
Then you go with him

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.840
as you had a good relationship, right?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.760
You just keep an eye on Lan Tian

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.720
To see if he really

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.080
cuts down the relationship with Song Chacha

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
What if Lan Tian

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.360
didn't disconnect

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.960
Cancer cells need to be eradicated

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.920
Even my kids

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.960
I'll make a cancer cell

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.120
Then,

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.960
You have resort

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.360
and I have the group Lan

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.760
Not answering the phone,
didn't stay at home

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920
Is he here

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880
Hello, blond hair guy

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.680
Is this the training center?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.320
You really have keen eyes

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920
One glance at me

00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:31.520
I told you I'm an athlete, sister

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.520
Sister? Who is your sister?

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.160
Where is Lan Tian

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.920
Lan Tian? He fainted

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200
In the medical room

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.720
What?

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.320
Why?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.400
I didn't knock him out

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.600
Why are you yelling at me?

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.880
Where is medical room

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.320
Lan Tian, how are you

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
Are you hurt?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.760
Where does it hurt?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.719
Tell me!

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.240
You frightened me to death

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.840
Where does it hurt?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.759
Why don't you answer me?

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.080
Tell me right away

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880
Who are you?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.720
Who are you?

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.560
What are you doing?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.920
What are you doing?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.240
If I told Lan Tian the mail thing

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.200
He's gonna be pissed off

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.120
How do I, how do I

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.760
Or confess to Song Chacha?

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.879
You mean

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.000
you responded to the email

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.920
I was just kidding

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.000
I'm kidding too

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.640
I'm sorry

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.600
I'm so

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.039
She is

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.440
So unreasonable

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.040
It is very likely to happen

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.520
Better write a letter

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.760
Write a letter

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.760
Mom, where are you going?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.000
Your uncle's in prison

00:15:07.001 --> 00:15:08.319
We can't let him suffer

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.800
Can I bear to see him so?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.840
Even if the cost is high

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.360
We have to get a lawyer

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.080
You go find Lan Tian

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.880
Tan Tian told me

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.720
Whatever difficulties we encounter with

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.360
He will help us

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.040
And support us

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.040
Mom

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.840
He has changed a lot

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.240
You met him?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.320
You met Lan Tian?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.240
He, he's right here

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.640
He's right here?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.160
You came here

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.600
For him?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360
Where is he?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.440
At the resort?

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.000
You take him home now

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.639
Or I'll try to find him

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.440
No, mom

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.080
He's a bit busy recently, maybe later?

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.160
Fine

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.680
Well, then we'll stay here.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.760
I remeber her living around here

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.240
Mom, I've gotta go now.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.720
Goodbye

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.120
It's just like bad guy's

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.520
Bah

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.800
Fortunately, I wrote a letter to told her

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.640
Sorry

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.440
Your loan has not been approved

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.520
I came here to finish nothing

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.460
Uncle Kong?

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.280
Chacha, are you with your mother?

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.880
No, what's going on？

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.160
I went home and found her out

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.919
She is not sane

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.920
Where would she go?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.960
Got it, I'm calling her

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
Okay

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.320
Mom, Where are you?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.680
I'm bored

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.320
So come straight to Lan Tian

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.880
Talk to him

00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:28.120
your uncle thing

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.920
So you're at the resort?

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.560
NO, no, no, mom

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.440
I'll go with you tomorrow

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
I have arrived

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.160
I should see him

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560
Mom, mom!

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.200
Mom, you can't see him

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.560
Hello

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.960
I want to find Lan Tian

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.879
You just tell him I'm Chacha's mother

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.880
He knows me

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
What's matter

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.280
I dreamed of crows

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.440
It's a bad thing

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.120
You should think differently

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:22.720
Look

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.680
Last night

00:19:23.681 --> 00:19:24.816
I dreamt that I had won the first prize

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.720
But today, I'm still
giving you a physiotherapy

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.760
Fine

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.240
But I....

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.120
I always had a bad feeling

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.000
Did she see the letter?

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.960
Did she see any letter?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.760
Why is there no response at all?

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.160
Was she mad after reading the letter?

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880
Do it

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.640
What?

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.840
Don't waste time, just do it

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.480
Call Lan Tian

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120
Why? Why tell him?

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.800
Can't we settle it privately?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160
I'll cooperate with you

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.840
Shut up, just call him

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.600
Now

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:45.520
Hi

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.760
Hey, It's a fine day, isn't it?

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:51.840
You met my mom

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.640
I'm asking whether you met my mom?

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.200
No, I haven't

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.320
Didn't you come to me?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640
Hey, lamp bulb

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160
Hey

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760
What's wrong

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.720
Mom, where are you, mom!

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:19.520
Mom

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.960
Mom

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.720
Chacha

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.960
Why are you here

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.920
What're you doing

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.200
I, I'm watching flowers

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.160
Why do they grow here?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.240
Who is he

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.360
I, I'm

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.040
He's my valet

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.040
Let's go, mom

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:41.560
Valet?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.240
When you have valet?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.360
Huh?

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.560
He is a jinx

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600
Let's go

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.560
Lamp bulb said I'm a jinx?

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.080
Ms.Li

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.080
Hello

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.640
We'll take this scene later

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.920
Is that all right?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.480
Let me surprise you

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.120
That's Li Bao, a superstar!

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.320
Right?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120
Whatever

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320
Brother Yongze

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.080
Yongze

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.760
Brother Yongze

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.240
She's coming, she'coming

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.680
My heart flew up into my mouth

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.120
I've heard you're secret training

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.080
You want to get back to your area?

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.880
I'm working right here

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.600
Meet you, that's good

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.120
Well, you go work

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Yongze

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Hey everybody

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.360
This is my gossip man

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.080
In private, we appreciate each other

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.640
And have a good relationship

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760
Really?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760
I don't think so

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880
Li Bao

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.960
I heard you work here

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.600
So I came to see

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.440
Is there anything funny

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.240
It seems that something has happened

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480
What did I miss?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880
Brother Yongze

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.640
When will you give me

00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:21.160
the breaking inside story?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.520
I've got the editor

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
Don't keep me dangling

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.280
I told you I'd contact you in private

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.240
What are you doing here

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.000
Encumbrance, stop playing today

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.440
Formal training

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520
Where are you going?

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.080
What does he mean

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.400
Look

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.176
I'll refund half your money
to get him out of here

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.040
Did we swim?

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360
What do you want

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.160
Waiting for Yongze

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760
Fuck you!

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.280
Sister

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.000
You work too hard, please drink some water

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120
I'm tired of it

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.040
Well, drink some water

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.760
Why is he endlessly going after that?

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.240
Who?

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.400
Welcome to Westin resort

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560
Reporter Xu

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.600
You're too bold

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.240
What if Yongze finds out

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.800
It's you

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.400
Oh honey, what're you doing here

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.160
I sent the message

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:40.120
You're sneaking around with reporter Xu

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.320
It's too suspicious

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.320
When do you give me the
breaking inside story?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.400
I've got the editor

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.720
Dong't keeping me hangling

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.320
I analyzed it

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:55.240
No one can get my phone

00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:57.600
Except you

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720
So

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.319
Want to create a gossip?

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.480
Of course not, honey

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.400
He threatened me with the affair between us

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.000
Let me give him another one

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.119
I just revealed one thing

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.440
A little

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.720
You have to be considerate

00:28:14.721 --> 00:28:16.920
that it's not easr for a woman to fight

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.200
So I want to protect myself

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.400
I know, I'm selfish

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.239
But I didn't send him the video

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.240
Did you know

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.600
Fraud, intimidation, libel

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.759
That's enough

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.520
to get you out of the
entertainment business

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.600
Sorry honey, I was wrong honey

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.360
Don't just care about your face

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.600
please take care of your dignity

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.679
As a girl

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.280
Kneel down easily to the power

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.160
It's not appropriate, is it?

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.720
And, I'm not your honey

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800
Don't call me that

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.560
Anyway, I have a bad temper

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.520
No patience, you know about this

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.480
I don't like your attitude

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.160
towards swimming

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.280
Too casual

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.840
Look

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.040
He and I

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400
only keep one

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600
You can choose

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.319
I'll warn him again

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.960
Does he have anything on you?

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.680
It looks like something happened

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.040
between you and him, right?

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.200
He has something that I don't have

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.840
So I wanna hold him

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.560
Is that okay?

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.160
Fine

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120
But I need to remind you

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.440
You're being far-fetched

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.480
It's gonna be tiring

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.360
Well,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.920
You know all my notion

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.080
And I need remind you

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.080
You lalways works in fits, and starts

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.120
Come whenever you want

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.120
Go whenwver you want

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.960
You think you're an athlete?

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.399
Even though

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.720
Your family own the club

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.880
You have to pay attention to

00:30:26.881 --> 00:30:28.920
how the coach feels

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Lan Tian

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040
You, you

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.440
You, you crazy woman, why are you here

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.640
Crazy, crazy woman

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.160
Hey, how did you know him

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.880
Who's the crazy woman

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680
You old ruffian

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.760
Are you used to living there?

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.680
You made a good arrangement

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.720
Now I'm the president

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.679
So which of us

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.920
is incharge?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.520
I don't like administrative work

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.760
But, he sends you here

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.200
To spy on me?

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.480
How is that possible

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680
That

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.160
Absolutely impossible

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.720
Whatever

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.680
I'm not the one

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.680
that is easily controlled

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.080
well

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.360
Give me a drink

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.520
Cheers

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.960
Have a good time

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560
at Yajule Qingshuiwan Bay

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.720
Sister Lan Xian

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.440
I'm here

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.680
What's up

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.600
I never thought

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.760
That one day, I'll run Lan Tian's resort

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880
Really?

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.680
Why didn't Lan Tian run it himself

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.040
My father arranged all

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.040
On the one hand, Lan Tian wanna swim

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.280
I can help him

00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:18.280
It can also enhance my
relationship with him

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.840
On the other hand,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.040
Maybe,

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.600
He wanna test me ability

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.640
Tha sounds good

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.000
I'm not talking to you about family

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.720
Have you met Lan Tian?

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.520
Just like what you said

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.360
My relationship with him is over

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520
We broke up

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.240
His feelings for me

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.120
have changed

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.600
Is that not good?

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.520
You have to adjust

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.159
So that you can face it

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.000
Anytime

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.520
anywhere

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.560
a famous saying goes like that

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.160
Time changes everything

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.960
But in fact

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.920
The most important thing

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:14.400
Is to change yourself

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.520
Only in this way

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:18.520
will everything change

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.440
But now

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.520
I don't wanna see Lan Tian

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.600
Everything doesn't do what people want

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.720
Otherwise, I would have
inheriter Lan's group

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.920
Sorry, my mom is waiting for me

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.960
I've to go

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.240
Wait

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.280
You don't need money now?

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.440
This is

00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:52.720
No

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840
It's a loan

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.640
But I have strings attached

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.760
I want you to work at the resort

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920
Sister Lan Xin

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Relax

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.320
I'm doing this for your good

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.280
I do need money

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.960
But I would rather endure hardships

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.559
than work in the place with Lan Tian

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.190
So I told you

00:34:10.191 --> 00:34:11.440
You have to adjust

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.120
You're being brave now

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.599
But once you go back

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.150
You'll face to the debt collertors

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.230
And your mom is vulnerable

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:20.760
What if she doesn't accept it

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.039
And breakdown

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040
What should you do

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280
Just sit down

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.480
Do you know the reason why
Lan Tian gives up swimming

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920
It's you

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.359
He afraid to remind you
of your brother Zhihao

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.000
when he was swimming

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.760
But now, he is swimming again

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520
It means

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.560
There's not nuch left
of his feeling for you

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.440
Maybe for survival

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.640
He's so determined to choose this path

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.920
He's willing to let go of everything

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.000
in order to survival

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.400
Even love and self-esteem

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.600
Now think about it

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.600
He's pathetic

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.120
You don't have to turn me down so soon

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.120
If you don't make up your mind in the end

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.440
You can return it back

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.240
Nobody is all smooth sailing

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.840
If anyone wants to help you

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.400
You should feel glad

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880
Think about it

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.480
Song Chacha, you must not let me down

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.400
I'm waitting to see the play

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.320
Sorry, lamp bulb

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.240
Why do I

00:36:32.241 --> 00:36:36.080
Always do stupid things?

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120
Mail and video

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.760
I screwed up

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.800
Mr.Bai

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:47.440
Here is your message

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.800
What message

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.960
Come on, eat more

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.720
Otherwise, It's wasteful

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.280
Am I a trash can?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.480
Eat everything?

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.120
Sorry

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160
For what?

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:25.760
For, the video stuff

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960
And

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480
What else?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.999
The message

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Well

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.000
Since you're Lan Tian's friend

00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.160
I forgive you

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.400
Is it difficult to give up Lan Tian？

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.760
If I answer "Yes, it's"

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400
Will you help me?

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.240
I'm kidding

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.120
I won't see him unless I'm crazy

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.640
I'll forget Lan Tian

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.040
Everything

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320
Yes

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040
You should told him

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720
People like him

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.120
Not worth mentioning in your life

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.400
That's revenge

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.760
Anyway, before I got the e-mail

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.400
It's still a good memory

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.119
So, put these memories away

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.080
When I want to remeber

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.320
Take it out again

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.720
Well, what were you gonna say

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.040
Nothing

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.400
Keep drinking

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880
Keep drinking

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.400
I'm not drunk

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.800
You see, I can walk straight

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.000
Knock it off

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.360
I'll see you home

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.960
You kidnapped me

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.320
I warn you

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840
You

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480
Playing with fire

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.040
Threaten me?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.560
Help

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.800
There's a pervert here

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.880
Enough, I am not a pervert

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.360
I'm freshmeat, okay?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.400
Let's go home

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.760
Hey

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.440
Is this your house?

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.720
So you can sleep

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800
Wake up

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.400
Hey, Song Chacha

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.840
Wake up

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.320
Song Chacha

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.960
Did you send me back

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320
Who else?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.159
You don't know

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.840
how heavy it is to carry you

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640
You better?

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.920
Stop joking

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.440
How coule I be drunk

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840
Byebye

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.680
I have thought about it

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.040
I can't accept it

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.040
Sister Lan Xin

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.080
Thanks for your help

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560
But I'not sure

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.560
If it's a good choice

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.680
You gave up a chance

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.480
Which you can prove yourself

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.199
You should ignore him

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.280
Live a good life

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.079
Let him know

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.560
You'll have a better life without him

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.120
Yajule Qingshuiwan

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.720
where to make you open-minded

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.560
here

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.440
You'll find a new beginning

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.280
Struggle rather than regret

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.960
Do I have a better way

00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.120
to prove myself?

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.840
Yes, you should told him

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.120
People like him

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.320
Not worth mentioning in your life

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.560
Sometimes, forgetting an emotion

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.560
is like eliminating the
accumulation of food

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.000
You have to learn to put it down

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.280
Let's face it

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.200
If you don't get back yourself

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.360
The future will be worse

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.040
As for this

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.320
You had better think about it clearly

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.460
Sister Lan Xin, Can I change my mind?
