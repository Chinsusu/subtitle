00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.400
I ask you one question.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Who am I to you?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.640
Your friend?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.360
Or your opponent?

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
I go first.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
To me

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.400
you are and you will
always be my best friend.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Even

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.520
you challenged me.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.720
Understand?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.240
I am back.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.160
It's a little awkward.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.880
What's so intense?

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.280
Why don't we celebrate with some dinks?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720
Sure.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.360
I thought you were in a fight again.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.040
Are we kids?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.840
Mean to be!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.640
Come on.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.360
Or

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.440
You should get married.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.360
You need some spanking!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680
Cha Cha, you are so lucky.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.480
Even you got fired as a casual worker.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
But

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.959
you triumph and come back

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.160
as Bai Yongze's private chief.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.200
Tell me, how did work him out?

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.320
Seduction?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.920
What seduction? Go away!

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240
He might just think I am pitiful.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.800
Adorable, it is.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.320
So,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800
you are not with Bai Yongze, aren't you?

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.800
Howis that possible?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.880
Yeah, Lan Tian is

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960
better than Bai Yongze.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.520
Only in this way does
my lfe have insurance.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.320
It's Jiang Shi.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.280
He said he is eating in a restaurant.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.880
So it is with Lan Tian and Bai Yongze.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.480
What are you doing?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.080
For our future.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.640
So not sensible.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.920
Jiang Shi.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.720
Oh my angel, come on here.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.840
Come on my girlfriend.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Mind if I sit?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.920
Of course not. Sit.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.160
Lan Tian.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.120
Do you mind if I sit?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
Suit yourself.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.000
Come on sit.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.600
Come on.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720
Bai Yongze.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.480
As an athlete, are you
allowed to dringk at night?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.520
Give it to me. I'll drink the rest.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.240
Do both of you know

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.400
Lan Tian and Bai Yongze are doing

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.880
to championship contest?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.160
Really? That's great Lan Tian.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.320
Ouch, I have a little stomach issue.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.800
Excuse me!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640
Yong Ze.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.720
Is she your girlfriend?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760
Why did she 'That's great Lan Tian'.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.880
She jsut cared about her boyfriend's buddy.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.000
Come on, cheers!

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.480
My angel never drinks.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.959
Bai Yongze who got dismissed
by America Jeff Star

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.279
is going to have

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.040
his first contest

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680
since he came back.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.199
It's believed that

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.279
he is going to rule the championship

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.679
through this international contset.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.080
Miss,

00:06:17.081 --> 00:06:18.559
The choice to contest in this
national championship...

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.320
Did you hear that?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.280
Yes, I heard. He is coming back.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.000
What do you say if I

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.200
go to him and encourage him?

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320
Encourage?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.200
Is this Bai Yongze's ring?

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.320
Hou can you wear this?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480
Take it off.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.920
I don't want to once I put it on.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200
Go and check

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.160
tickets to Hainan.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.160
Alright.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.920
It's your father again.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.560
I got messed up when

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.600
the news was broadcast.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.639
Why do you take part in
this kind of contest

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.200
for your coming-back?

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.960
What should I do if

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.800
if your dad is angry with me?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.240
Help yourself out.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.440
You...

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680
What?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.880
I have got slight signal. Hold on!

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.439
You are going to a contest.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440
I add some protein-rich food into your.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.120
Whose recipe? Lan Tian's?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560
You are so happy when you heard

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.760
Lan Tian is going to take
part in the contest.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200
I...

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080
Darling!

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.919
Why are you here?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.120
I am here

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.520
to cheer you up.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Why is she here?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400
What's she doing here?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.880
Not your business.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.240
Why?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.280
Who am I to you?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.240
Let's jsut go out first!

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.880
Why do we go out?

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.560
What's wrong both of you?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.880
Are you really together?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.040
What the fuck?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.920
Then why is she in your room with food?

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.160
I am his private chief.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.440
But I won't be soon.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Cha Cha.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.840
Cha Cha. Cha Cha.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.240
Cha Cha.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.520
Yong Ze.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960
Stay away from me.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.600
All of this is a lie.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.800
Bai Yongze is a lie.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.040
The ring is a lie.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.520
Cha Cha.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.920
This is it.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.840
I can't let a fake relationship

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.159
get in the way of a rwal one.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.160
Fake or real.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680
I told you

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.840
we are nothing right now.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.599
It's only her wishful thinking.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.400
Then why does she has the same

00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:09.680
the ring as one you gave me?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.200
I am sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.920
This ring actually means nothing.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.000
I still feel happy to get this

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.040
because this is the first time.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.520
I just realized how women feel

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.679
when they first got

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.680
a ring.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.720
Even our relatinship is a lie,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.360
but my feeling is real.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.600
You think this is just your first time?

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.520
I gave a ring to a woman

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.040
for the first time.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I don't care whether you
are my girlfriend or not.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.280
Do you know how much effort I put

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.120
into this ring?

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.680
What a fool for a man to

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360
give two women the same ring

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.080
I lost it.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.440
And Li Bao found it.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.760
After that,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.080
I bought a same one

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.400
I didn't want to tell you that

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960
I feel embarrassed

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.080
Even this is a meaningless ring.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680
It's yours

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.800
when I give it to you.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.880
You can drop it

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080
if you don't want it.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
Darling.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.520
Just go.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.680
There is nothing between you

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.760
and that girl, right?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.440
You did that on purpose

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.120
That's why you siad that?

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.120
Which part of 'Go' you don't understand?

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.960
Darling.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.640
Darling.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.280
Please don't do that.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.160
I pull of my announcement

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.759
as soon as I heard

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:47.920
you were going for a contest.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360
I flew straight here.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.280
I don't want to make it like sacrifices.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.200
I wanted to to do that.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.920
Because I need you.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.720
I nedd you more than anyone.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.680
I am too vulnerable to take

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.520
any more hurt

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840
Thanks to you,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.719
I am pleased

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.839
to get your text

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.320
or a call.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.240
I can't lose you.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.480
I can't lose you. Darling.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.480
Don't leave me.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960
Li Bao.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.320
Does no one tell you what

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.200
is the most worthless

00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:50.800
thing is?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
It's sympathy.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.080
All I have for you is sympathy.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040
Let me go.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.400
And let yourself go.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.680
You will get huurt

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.520
if you hold on to it.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.520
There is still something

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.480
that is remembering,

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.080
just keep it, OK?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680
Go.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.720
Just go.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.120
You won't? I go.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360
Yong Ze,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.000
can you live without hurt?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.640
Its seems imposibble.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.160
Everyone of us has a virus

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.760
named emotion,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
among which love,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.400
hate and

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
jealous

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640
are the deadist.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.440
But we still have to be strong to fight it

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560
and overcome it.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.800
So, Song Chacha,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.440
don't be afraid to get hurt.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.040
What do you want?

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.959
Don't you pretend atonement

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.120
for having done an injustice.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.999
I did that to my private chief

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
for her own good.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.560
Just take that as spur.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.896
All I ask her to do is
to learn some cooking.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.920
I just want to her to seperate sugar
from salt, Coco cola and sauce.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.840
She's still got some hope.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.240
Damn it, garbage text.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920
What's it?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040
Why didn't Song Chacha

00:17:21.358 --> 00:17:22.399
come today?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.000
Don't know.

00:17:24.358 --> 00:17:27.519
What about having a taste of my cooking?

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.080
I lose my appetite of your cooking.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.280
Song Chacha does better
in cooking than you do.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.520
Why don't you ask her to come?

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.680
What about ording some take out?

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.240
No.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.200
Since when do you love home cooked meals?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720
Right.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.040
Do I get used to it

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.200
because I had some days ago?

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.000
Why are you laughing?

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.216
Today, we going to do resistance training

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.480
Focus on the 50m final sprint

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.240
Let Bai Yongze show us
theexplosiveness of sprint.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.000
Rest of you watch.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.320
Why do I go first?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.160
Save some energy for training.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840
Do it.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
What?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:06.720
Come on, Yong Ze. Come on.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.080
Come on, speed up.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.640
Come on Yong Ze.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760
Link it up.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.760
Make your sprint.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800
Why is that?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.120
Peng Peng. Take a look.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880
What's wrong, Yong Ze?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880
You OK?

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:49.400
Yong Ze.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600
You OK?

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080
Do you feel good?

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800
No.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.040
You are supposed to take this.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.840
Hey, what happened to you?

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:13.800
His body status is not very good.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.880
He got sunk in the pool today.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160
Almost drowned to death.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.280
What happened?

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360
Song Chacha.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.200
Did you make something good for him to eat?

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.640
He is right.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.400
I didn't see you reacently.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.520
Anything wrong?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.000
Even so, you can't do that.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.240
It's special time.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.519
Contest is coming.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.760
He needs to eat something nice.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.759
You got your job because

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.880
of him.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.320
You have to treat him right.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Got it?

00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840
Professor Fang?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.040
I dicussed your issue

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.520
with her

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And we made a decision.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.960
You symptoms are serious.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.440
And you need some training.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.159
Or you will have this issue

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.640
again when you swim.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.680
What kind of training.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.040
Just conversation and relaxing
practice, for starters.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.760
What? Conversation?

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.680
I mean.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.640
Do you have a crush on me?

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.959
I am much younger than you.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.040
Hey, watch it.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280
I have a crush on you?

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.240
Why not Coach Huang?

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.720
Sorry, Coach Huang.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.240
I was just outspoken.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.960
Stop jesting!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Do the training with me.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.239
I wonder what training that is.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.600
What are the relaxing practice?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.600
I will arrange some yoga nidra.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.920
You can have a try.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.840
What?

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.840
I do yoga?

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200
Are you kidding?

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.200
That's girls' stuff.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
I don't want to do it.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.560
So could you please tell

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.680
me why you fainted?

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360
Maybe, exhausted.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.280
That's it. I tried.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.200
You are resposible for what happens

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.400
if you don't do well in the championship.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120
Let's make a bet.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.760
Cancel the training

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840
if I win the first prize.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.199
Deal, don't make it,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.440
do yoga with me.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800
Deal

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840
So, that's it

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.000
Cha Cha, what's this smell?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.560
Mom, I made something.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.240
I get washed.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.440
It smells so good.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.360
Doing some wife's homework.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.240
Stayed up so late for Lan Tian.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.440
I didn't make this for you.

00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:35.719
I made for my mom.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.160
I take the rest to you.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.080
I didn't make this for you.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.240
It's not for you.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.840
Song Chacha.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.199
I made this especially for you.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.400
For you...

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.080
What?

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.680
What?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.480
Especially for me?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880
No, it's not.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880
I don't know.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
Song Chacha.

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.640
Do you want to see my contest?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.600
Come on.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960
Yong Ze, come on.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.160
In position

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040
Come on.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.280
Come on.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.960
He swims so fast.

00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:05.920
No one is faster than hime.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.040
Bai Yongze, come on

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.480
Bai Yongze

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400
Just leave him.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.680
He is so proud.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440
Just leave him.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.320
Anyway

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.080
Lan Tian got the third prize this time.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:29.920
Than you.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960
Congratulations.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:34.840
But what about Bai Yongze.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.440
It will be hard to get

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.720
his coming-back again.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.120
Cheers.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.040
You did good this time, Lan Tian.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:57.800
To be honest,

00:29:57.801 --> 00:29:59.440
I didn't expect that from you.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.120
You really have potential

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.000
to get the first prize.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.039
Then I take this as my

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.640
first-prize congratulations.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.960
Thank you.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.080
It doesn't feel good to this

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.760
when Yong Ze is here.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.000
East Flying Fish, Bai Yongze.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.480
How could that happen?

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720
It's all because of me

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.000
There is something wrong
with the food I made.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.320
With the food I made.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560
You sure?

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.160
He said he had a stomachache

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.560
right before contest starts.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.879
Why did't you say earlier?

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.760
We could have taken some precautions.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Take medicine

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.320
or quit.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:45.720
I am sorry.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920
But,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.200
shouldn't we contact Bai Yongze first?

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.319
I did, he didn't answer.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.919
I texted him, like, a hundred times.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.320
A hundred?

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.280
I told him there is
nothing to be ashamed of.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.200
Cha Cha is waiting here, tell him to come.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.920
Cha Cha. Cha Cha. Where are you going?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.360
Eh~...

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.200
I don't where he is either.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.959
Why are mad at me?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.600
I didn't let him out.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.639
Everyone is mad at me.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.960
Everyone is mad at me.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.000
Still no word from Yong Ze?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.480
No.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.439
I almost turn this place upsidedown

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.320
I still can't find him.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.439
Where else can he be?

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.960
Sis, where do you think he can go?

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.720
I haven't finished my...

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.080
Such much pressure!

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.760
You must be there, Bai Yongze.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880
Bai Yongze

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.400
Great.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.720
I know you are here.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.040
Stay away from me.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.080
I can't go back there.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080
Just go.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.120
I told you to go away.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.440
This road is dark.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:35.520
I pluck up courage to come here.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.160
I am afraid that I can't.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720
So.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.920
I can't even I want to.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.960
What would you do if I weren't here?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.400
Stuck here! Or what?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.600
Everyone makes a mistake.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600
It's not a mistake.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.320
I don't know when

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.400
it started like this.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.000
Then, did you go to hospital?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.480
Psychologist said

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.280
I have sports anxiety.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.880
If that's all.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.360
What concerns me more is

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.680
I am really afraid that others know this

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.920
for no god damn reason.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040
Don't be afraid.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.159
What should I do if it happens again?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.000
Do I have to take that training?

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.239
Why don't you give it a shot?

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.639
What if it's solved?

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.000
Trust me, it's gonna be OK.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.679
Still no word from him?

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:51.239
Song Chacha found him

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:52.880
They are together.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.399
Oh, gosh, I am starving.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.880
I am starving. I gotta eat something.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.840
You tell them

00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.640
there is something wrong with my soup.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.400
I told them so.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.720
I am not professional anyway.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.680
It may happen.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.720
But I didn't have it.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
You didn't.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.400
I made that for a whole night.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.000
I was relucdant to have that.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.720
I saw your black eyes that day.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.120
I know how much effrots into that soup

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.120
I want to finish it after the contest

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.400
as a reward.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.680
It's not gold.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600
Song Chacha.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.440
Thank you!

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.600
Cha Cha?

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560
Mom.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.080
Anut.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.880
This guy...

00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:56.280
Is he your sidekick?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.160
Yeah, it's me.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.400
Sidekick of Song Chacha.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.680
Mom, why are you outside?

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.520
Lan Tian called many times.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.920
Asking if you are home.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.040
Where are you with him? It's so late.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.960
What if Lan Tian sees you

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.280
and mistake you?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040
Lan Tian is my friend.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.960
You don't have to worry about that.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.800
Then, I'll leave.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.040
Cha Cha

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.720
There is nothing

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.480
betweeen you and he, isn' it?

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.200
No, absolutely.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560
Absolutely no.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.680
What some drinks?

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.960
You know what

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
I can't make it this far

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.200
without you.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.240
Is this comfort?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.040
No.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.320
I mean:

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.520
I need you.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.080
I want to tell you that

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.400
don't let nothing bother you.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360
Don't be anxious

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.440
I was gonna give it up.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.960
Untill the day when

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.600
I say you were swimming in America,

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880
I am not complimenting.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.720
I really want to see you once.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720
The real you.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560
I mean.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.600
The thing you have when you are swimming.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.640
Just like said last time.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.680
You are my freind

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:04.720
not opponent.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:07.560
So.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.880
If you want me to give her up,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.320
I will.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.719
Why do you drag her into our conversation

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.800
every time?

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.360
Because she is our intersection

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.440
You made this up yourself.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.240
I don't care about

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.120
both of you.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200
But you,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.920
care much about me abou her.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.080
Don't you?

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.640
It doesn't kill you to speak the truth

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.400
This is the truth

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.600
If I have fellings for her,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.760
she will get hurt.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.960
You look so calm, Yong Ze.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.440
We are going to Australia for training.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.920
You should get high.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.840
You are so good.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.720
Why did you lose last time?

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960
Forget about it.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.480
You think we are going for fun?

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.440
We are going for sufferings.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.200
That's impossible.

00:39:37.201 --> 00:39:39.200
Our coach will give us
at least two days off.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440
Who?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960
Coach?

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.400
To be honest,

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.079
this is much impossible

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.080
than I lose again.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.080
Stop your fantasy.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.640
This is never gonna happen.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.640
Gosh,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.360
they just stick together again.

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.720
What's so funny?

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.160
Only know about having fun.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440
Listen up.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.360
You will be in trouble

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440
if you just have fun.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.576
I thought about giving some days off,

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600
but now, forget about it.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.600
Coach.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680
Attention.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.880
Our training in Australia

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.560
will be very tough.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.520
Everybody gets ready for that.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.160
Only in this way

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:25.840
can you be stronger

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.479
Only then can you have the chance

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.560
to pursue your dreams.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760
You hear me?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Get started.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.240
Enough power?

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.480
Maybe what I want is not swimming,

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.000
maybe just like what coach said,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.280
it's power.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.480
One can compete whoever

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.600
whoever it is.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.520
The kind that you can control your life.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.240
I can do anything if I can

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.400
make it.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.500
That's not a problem.
