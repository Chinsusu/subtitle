WEBVTT

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.080
He left his phone here

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.440
I'd nearly foget. I haven't
found my phone yet

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.360
Lan Tian, is that the surprise?

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.360
Lan Tian? Surprise?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.800
So, do you want to use another
phone to blackmail again?

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.200
Lan Tian, are you with him?

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.840
You always said Lan Tian, Lan Tian

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.560
Do you know him?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.680
I am asking if that
scoundrel's with you now

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.400
That scoundrel?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.320
What's your name

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.080
Song Chacha

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.160
Lan Tian, do you know Song Chacha

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.760
Promise me, whatever happens

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.760
You definitely marry me

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.600
You're not running over
at the wedding, are you?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.720
Why didn't you tell me sooner

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.000
You can bring it next time

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.320
Where is Lan Tian

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.360
Why are you always looking for Lan Tian

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.880
Lan Tian is the one who's gonna marry me

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.880
But he didn't appear

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.520
The guy you're talking about is a jerk

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.119
But the Lan Tian I know said

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.319
He didn’t know Song Chacha

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320
Really?

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.920
What am I lying to you for?
He doesn’t know you

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.280
Okay, I got the phone

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.080
Goodbey, then, and thanks.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600
I'm leaving

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.920
I'm really leaving

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.840
What kind of person can that Lan Tian

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480
make you so sad

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640
You just go

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.880
I know my friend Lan Tian

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.760
He wouldn't do anything like this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.119
And, I never heard

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.800
that he had a fiancee

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880
Enough

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680
You go

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.320
Who’s the runaway man?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.600
Why the sudden heart pains?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.720
Maybe I am under too much stress

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840
Lan Tian

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.776
Why are you hanging around in the street

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.600
Didn't you have to wait
for me to come back?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.440
Suddenly wanted to go out for a walk

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.840
Did you get your phone back?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.720
Yeah, but... That girl looks pathetic

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.840
As if she's going to crumble

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.360
I even wanted to help

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.400
So that's not your fiancée, right?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.640
Your expression was difficult to read

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.360
And where are we heading for?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.960
Just go, and dress yourself up

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.400
What do we come here for

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.240
Yu Ge comes and he desires to see you

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.159
You have so much friends

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.680
And you know the Olympic champion too.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240
I'm popular

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.840
Cheers

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960
Cheers

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.040
How are you, Bai Yongze

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.640
A lot of things have happened recently

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.040
have you adjusted to a good condition?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
Not bad

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120
Look Yu Ge

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.280
Lan Tian is going to
re-enter the swimming arena

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:17.640
Really?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920
Uhm, yeah

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.080
Being rich is great

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.120
Don't have to worry too much

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.240
Not necessarily

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.720
What I really want, I can't get it.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.680
Yu Ge, which one of us you
think is more appropriate

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.800
to be your successor

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.720
It's unclear

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.640
But, no matter who he is

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.520
not only he has a target

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.320
but also makes a plan

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.240
So, as of tomorrow

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.080
Pack your luggage, let's leave Beijing

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.360
Where are we going?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680
Hainan

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040
Hainan!

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.080
Finally!

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.640
Just for training

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.840
what a pity for this place

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.400
Then find something else to do

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.240
I won't stop you

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.360
Do you want to set me trapped

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.760
and beat me

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.520
in this way?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.760
Although things have been bad lately,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.240
it is not enough to bring me down

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.840
True talents still manage to stand out

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.760
You're so confident

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.800
Welcome to home

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.560
Nice service attitude

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.680
Is this resort yours?

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.480
I Inherited from my grandfather

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.320
I put it in custody to my lawyer

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.880
when i was in America

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.200
Now I'm back

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.120
It's mine

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.880
If I have a girlfriend later

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200
You know

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.600
Arrange deluxe suits for me

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.480
Girlfriend?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120
Li Bao?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720
No

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720
By the way

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.680
have you arranged for the coach?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.960
Already

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.160
Who's he

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.080
Alexander

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.480
Ivanovsky

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.360
Who's he!

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.320
Look at your face

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.960
Is he better known than them?

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.680
I can't wait to see him

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.200
Of course!

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.840
Why didn't you tell me?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.520
Who the hell is he!

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.960
It's really gorgeous

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.760
So beautiful!

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.240
Sir

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280
Sir

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.520
Are we really gonna train here?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880
You're annoying

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.400
You've asked it a thousand times

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.800
Bravo, bravo!

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.920
After such a long distance

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.800
and ended up in my hometown

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.440
If i had known it,

00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:16.210
I would not have paid
three months of tuition

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.120
And be bewildered by Goggles Man equipment

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.839
Do you just regard Goggles Man equipment

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.440
as an equipment?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.760
It's a belief, you know?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.799
It inspires you to work hard for your goal

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.479
like Goggles Man

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.040
You know?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.080
Stop talking. Or I'll punish you

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.280
Okay, okay

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.000
I got a great bargain

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
Bai Yongze!

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.160
It's really Bai Yongze!

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.160
I told you

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.320
There must be important person

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920
Let me introduce

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.920
This is Coach Huang Donglei

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.680
Who?

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.360
Yeah

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.520
I am the Huang Donglei who was suspected of

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.480
taking medicine and withdraw from swimming

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280
Where are you going

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.920
I know I'm down

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.000
But I won't practice with people like this

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.360
Hey, who are you talking about?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.920
You think you're good?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.200
But I agree

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.880
American players are really
good at making nicknames

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.400
Sorry, although we have a good relationship

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.320
I absolutely don't accept this man

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:52.560
Yeah

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.639
I am the Huang Donglei who was suspected of

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.320
taking medicine and withdraw from swimming

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.536
Although we have a good relationship

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.160
I absolutely don't accept this man

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.240
Sorry Lan Tian,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.880
I'm so sorry

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.560
Is he the only one with
special personality?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.360
I have my personality

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.719
If I ever wanted to

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.160
please the rich

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.760
I would had three swimming pools

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.560
About Bai Yongze

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160
I'll try to persuade him

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.400
Please don't. If he stays

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.920
There will be more troubles

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.376
And you must keep that in mind

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.416
That you are going to participate
in the standard match

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.560
Don't drag others down

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.720
But I wanna try again

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.440
Please give me some more time

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.759
I will call Bai Yongze back

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.880
and train with you

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080
Do you think it works?

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.560
I don't believe it

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720
This is life

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.560
About Bai Yongze, I wanna try again

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.080
Please give me more time

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.960
I'll call Bai Yongze back
and train with you

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
Don't go

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.440
Don't go. Lan Tian

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.040
Pleasa don't go!

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.680
How could a man who deliberately failed

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.320
to make an appointment contact me

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.880
Chacha! Open the door!

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.920
Okay! Wait a minute

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.040
Chacha! Open the door

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.480
You have delayed your rent for a long time

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.240
When can you pay it

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.360
I'm not a philanthropist

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:01.960
Hum, I'm sorry

00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:03.239
After the pay check,
I'll pay it immediately

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.920
Okay, enough. I won't let you explain

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.480
Within the week

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.280
Or I'll get you out of here in my way

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.040
Make a bet?

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320
Or

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.400
You can compete with Yu Ge

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.200
You win, you're in charge

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.400
Since you despise Coach Huang

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.880
Then you beat me first

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.800
Oh, no.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480
Good job!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
YE

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.080
Well, what do you say I beat you

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.480
Yu Ge, I didn't pay much attention

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.040
Just watch you swim

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.720
You mean

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.240
If you play as usual, you'll win

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.119
Are you seriously

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.640
to invite me to the culb?

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.120
We just bickers a bit

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Anyway

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.840
Admit the defeat for bet

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.480
You have to keep your promise

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.360
I know Coach Huang

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.320
Yongze, you are a man who won't give in

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.800
So is Coach Huang

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.760
I believe you two must
have something in common

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560
Think about it

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.590
Yongze, you are a man who won't give in

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.110
So is Coach Huang

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.000
I believe you two must
have something in common

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960
Think about it

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.360
This is Bai Yongze

00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:46.401
Have you found your phone?

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.280
It's been a few days

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.160
I found it, so stop thinking about it

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.560
We must meet

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.240
And I'll check it

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.040
Don't you believe me?

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.600
How can I rest assured

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.560
There are my photos in your phone

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.840
And our photos

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.040
And text messages and stuff

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.440
Okay, I'll delete them now

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.880
No, I delete them myself

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.480
Let's meet in a secluded place

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:15.640
I've had just about enough
of those annoying matters

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.960
Why hasn't he arrived yet

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.520
Reporter Xu pestered me every day

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.240
I'm getting nervous

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.200
You know I'm very sensitive

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.920
Even though you're unhappy

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.520
Please understand

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.400
All deleted?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.640
Then I'm leaving

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.000
A man's belt in the back seat

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.960
It'll be better to put it away

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840
I don't mind it

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.160
But what about the other men?

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.600
That would ruin the atmosphere

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.440
I'm ready to go

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720
I'm waning you

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.160
No one ever stood me up

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.680
You know what you must do

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.960
Now go!

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.000
Why are men called Lan
Tian so unreasonable?

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.560
Break the date with girlfriend

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.000
And threaten others not to break the date

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880
Hello?

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.120
Oops, my stomach hurts

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.880
I'm afraid I can't go

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400
Go for yourself today

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.440
Okay

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.120
It's too humiliating to come back like this

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.160
How can I go back right away?

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.039
I should carry a mighty bearing

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.080
and has the air of a king.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160
Cool!

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.360
Of course

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080
Why are you still here

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.440
I told you

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.360
No one knows you better than I do

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.480
Humiliation is temporary

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.720
Swimming is the most important thing

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.016
Come on. Swimming is the
most important thing

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.360
Wait

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:04.720
Who said that

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.800
Lan Tian

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.920
Don't thank me so much

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.576
I came here just for the
development of swimming

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.440
and other teammates

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800
Shut op

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.480
Do some warming up exercise first

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.080
50m freestyle test

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360
What?

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.680
We haven't warmed up yet

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.320
Such an unprofessional coach

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.080
50m freestyle test. On your marks!

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.080
Who taught you to swim like this

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.240
Today's interim test, Guan
Jie is the first place

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.959
Well, I got to the end first

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.680
You're really the fastest in the water

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.000
But quality is more important
than speed in training

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.160
What a messy theory

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.240
I've seen the video of your game in the USA

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.560
Your paddles and turns can be better

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.320
But you're too pround

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400
You didn't do it

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.840
Your final result is 0.5
seconds behind the preiminary

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.680
Such a champion makes no sense

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.480
The real victory is defeating yourself

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.080
Who are you to say it doesn't make sense?

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.959
No one's swimming before they warm up

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.160
This is unprofessional

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.880
Swimming takes exlposive
force and endurance

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.800
My way of training is

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.359
I'm ordering you into the pool

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.560
And you will be into the pool

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.680
I'm in charge here

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.560
Today

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200
The training proogram

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240
is on the blackboard

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.800
Practice the basic movements

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880
No

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.040
That's for beginners

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320
set

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.760
Look

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.680
From now on

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.440
A man disobeys orders

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:30.720
Everyone will be punished together

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.920
So

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.120
Everybody

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.560
Go to the Ocean supermarket

00:23:36.561 --> 00:23:37.599
Bring two bottles back

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.040
of four liters of mineral water each

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.520
In 60 minutes

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:43.680
How could that be

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.240
40 minutes

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.120
Sir

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.440
Stop talking, okay?

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.280
It's usually 90 minutes

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560
Go

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600
I'm coming

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.000
The rent on these small
houses is really expansive

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:17.800
How can I pay for them

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.240
The landlord is about to get rid of me

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.800
What should I do

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.880
Hello

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.320
Is that Chacha?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.160
I'm Lan Xin, Lan Tian's sister

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.320
Sister Lan Xln

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.760
So much has happened over the years

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.120
Unfortunately, I'm abroad

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840
My dad died

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.720
The company closed down, too

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.240
My mom lost her memory

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.800
because of stress

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.400
She still thinks,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.160
My dad is abroad on business

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.200
You must have a hard time

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.000
Just feel desperate

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.040
And I lost contact with Lan Tian

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.880
Lan Tlan even cut off the contact with you

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120
Maybe

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.880
When his mom died

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.240
He's in a bad mood, too

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.760
So I'm trying too understand him

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.296
Because I know how painful
it is to lose the loved one

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.640
I thought he'd be back

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.200
after he was not sad

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.480
and contact with me

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.360
But he didn't

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.040
and I was informed of the
wedding by Uncle Lan

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.240
How do I understand these actions?

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.040
W....Wedding?

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280
Yeah

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.320
But on the wedding day, I was reneged.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200
Don't you know?

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.440
You okay?

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.120
Your legs are still shaking

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.280
That's my habit.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.160
Waiter! Two beers

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.280
One more!

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400
My God

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440
Brother Yongze

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.760
For a new start!

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.760
For the first day!

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.840
Cheers!

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.880
Cheers!

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600
Lan Tian's in Hainan

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040
Go find him

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120
Hainan

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.240
The unlucky man said Lan
Tian is also in Hainan

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.200
Is it really the same person?

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.800
Maybe he's having a problem

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.480
Why don't you ask him face to face?

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.880
Why Hainan!

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.136
Are you too dependent on my shoulders

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.240
when you walk?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.120
What about you

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.240
Yours arms around my waist are too tight

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.160
when you walk

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.280
The revolutionary friendship!

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.040
So enviable

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:48.840
So enviable

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:49.680
So enviable

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.880
Okay!

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.520
From now on

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720
We have to prepare

00:28:53.721 --> 00:28:55.161
for the team's first competency test

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.840
You're gonna try

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.160
to break through your weakness

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.480
This is our team's first test

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.040
The best result is

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.600
On behalf of our team

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.536
to participate in the national
standards competition

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:07.960
But

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.480
We shuould first perfrom our small targets

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.160
What

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.760
I won't

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.080
My level is higher than the standard, okay?

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400
I know

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.960
You did well abroad

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.520
and took part in a lot of competitions

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.959
But you're back now

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960
And come to me

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.000
You have to take part in the standard race

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.760
Look

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.160
There are no Dongfang Feiyue here

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.160
You have to do it step by step

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.280
and make a fresh start

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.640
You know?

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.480
Are you kidding me?

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.080
My freestyle is the

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.080
Fine, we race freestyle

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560
200m

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.680
I'm not demanding

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.216
Just withthin a minute
and fifty-five seconds

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.799
You can compete on behalf of the team

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.080
But...

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.080
Last year's line is 1 "53"

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.360
I know

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.000
It's clear that

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.880
freestyle plays an important role

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.200
in swimming

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.240
whether a team is good or not

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560
Depends on freestyle

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.000
Our list of for candidates is

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:06.960
Bai Yongze

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:07.880
Lan Tian

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.120
Jiang Shi

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.000
Guan Jie

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:10.760
Of course

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:11.680
Other players

00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:13.281
If you take less than 1minute and55secon

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.000
The tournament is open to you

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:15.920
There's no need to compare

00:30:15.921 --> 00:30:17.520
The winer must be Yongze

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400
Of course

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.080
Let's begin

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.800
Today, we train with this

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:26.880
You

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.320
I don't need it

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.200
You go and swim by yourself

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.920
I mean

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.960
You go and swim by yourself

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440
Training

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.680
Thank you

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.360
You

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.000
Been playing

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760
Here's a float

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Practice by yourself

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.480
You want me to time you?

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.240
Get out

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.520
Very good! Very good

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.600
I'm looking for Lan Tian

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.480
Who's Lan Tian?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.680
It's said to be a low-key boss

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.800
The one who owns the swimming club

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.016
Please leave your contact information

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.120
We'll convey it for you

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.360
I'll back later

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Is anybody there?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.400
You again?

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.120
Song Chacha

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.360
What did you see

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.320
I'm asking you what you see

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800
By the way

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.360
Lan Tian is your friend?

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360
I'm telling you

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.600
Even if I know him

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.680
I won't tell you

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200
No

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.800
It does not matter to you

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.560
She is so ..so

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.600
Ouch. That hurt

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.670
If you came for Lan Tian

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.280
Go for him

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.270
Why came to the locker room

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.000
It's clearly I'm in there

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960
Bai Yongze

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.040
You know I'm here

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.960
So meet me, huh?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320
No way

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.600
No wonder last night

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.360
I had a bad dream

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.320
Where are you going

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.000
If you want to ask me about
my affair with LiBao

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.150
There's nothing I can say

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.840
I was commissioned be Mr. Lan

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.480
Flying fish Bai Yongze is down

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.240
Lanshi group offers timely help

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.479
Mr.Lan asked me to write a story like this

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.800
with a photo

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.960
And promote the resort

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.760
Is that okay?

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.960
Bai Yongze, you should smile

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.200
Smile you know?

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.520
Laughing while swimming, that's stupid

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.000
Okay

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.440
Let's take photos outside

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.840
I've ifgured out the title

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.520
Bai Yongze's pool show

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160
That's wonderful, right?

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120
And interviews?

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.480
You can email me

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.320
I'll reply when I am free

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.920
But I'm not sure if I have free time

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120
Someone told me

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.000
There is a video, which can prove

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.880
the relationship between you and Lan Tlan

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160
A video?

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.480
I don't know what the video is

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.200
The video's on your phone

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.160
But you can send it to me

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.640
And I'll do some editing

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.639
To create a vivid story

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.640
For you

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320
Who told you

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.520
That's bullshit

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.800
I can't disclose that

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.640
I am doing this for your sake.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.599
If you have anything
that need to be reported

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.920
in advance

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:54.960
Remeber to tell me

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.200
I'll polish it for you

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840
Okay

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600
Go

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.279
So you are not interested in woman

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280
Right?

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.360
What are you doing?

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.640
Is it this?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.160
Just kidding

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.480
If it was edited

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.080
It's easy to be misunderstood

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.480
Who is it?

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.960
Who took my phone?

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.120
I'm going crazy!

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.920
The lamp bulb?

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480
Anyway

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.200
I can't just go back like this

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.280
At least to see Lan Tlan

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.800
I told you last time

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.640
You can't let her go

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.720
Do you know

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.440
what is she's gonna do to me?

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920
Wait!

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.720
Who are you

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.720
What the hell are you doing?

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.840
What do you want

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.559
Did you copy my phone?

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.560
Did you?

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.400
What?

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:55.800
Didn't you copy the content

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.360
and call the reporter?

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.360
What are you saying?

00:39:00.361 --> 00:39:03.760
That's why you threatened me?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.560
Are you sick? I didn't

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.080
Wait
