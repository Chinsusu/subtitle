WEBVTT

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.440
What

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.200
You left the club.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
Are you okay?

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.160
Noisy you

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.520
Now I'm in the same position as you.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.600
I left the club anyway.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.560
We must have a good drink today

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.600
But why are you responsible for this?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.360
And make me back

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.600
One can be without a job.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.320
But not without dignity.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.200
A girl is so vilified.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.840
How can you keep quiet?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.920
I can't stand them talking
about you like that.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.000
Are you satisfied with the answer?

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.040
Waiter, one more bottle.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.200
Two more bottles.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.480
Actually, it doesn't matter if I’m fired.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
But, your training

00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:54.160
it’s about your future.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.200
And haven't you been

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.641
choosing someone for the competition

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.280
Don't you care?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.840
Why bother your own future for me?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.040
Cause you're my girlfriend.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
Anyway

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.000
I’ve been officially

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.800
talked to others about us

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.600
Now everyone knows

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.720
You're mine

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.520
So, Bai Yongze just left.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.560
Then I can't let the Song ChaCha come back.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.560
I'm a boss.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.760
How could it be threatened by Bai Youngze

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.320
Bai once said

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.920
It's not Chacha’s fault.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.240
Shouldn't you have brought her back?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.360
Does she look better to you now

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.359
She’s like to die to live

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.600
and let me get her out of here?

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.680
No, not now

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.560
I brought Yongze here

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
So I'm responsible.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040
Dad said he was coming.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.680
So, if Dad knew Chacha was here

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.480
It's even harder to do.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.400
You know that better than I do.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.480
There's no other choice.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.800
Dismissed by the reason

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.680
What do those people think of me?

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.800
Anyway, for me

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.000
There's no more nostalgia.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.480
You should go back soon, too.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.800
To Lantian

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.520
Without any nostalgia

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.679
Since i was a kid

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.480
I tried my best to do so

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.960
At the orphanage.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.079
My dad said he was gonna adopt a kid

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.800
who swims very well

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.920
I remember I'd never been in water.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.040
But I said I could swim.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.240
And swims very well

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.080
But I can't reveal it

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.160
So, before he took me,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.679
I sneak out every day.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.280
Went to a nearby pool and practiced alone.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.160
Try my best

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.680
Can you believe that I learn it myself

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.959
I’m such a person

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.640
Who walked through all the pain to this day

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160
Yourself?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.240
You can learn to swim without a coach.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.800
If you don't try to go upstream,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.600
You just wait for drowning.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.880
Then you can learn it

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.760
These years

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.920
I've been surviving

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.240
so

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.920
I'm not going back because
of your requirement

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440
As for the competition,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240
I will always find

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.840
Someplace that suits me

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.800
Cheers

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240
You drank too much

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.640
So I took you home.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.840
You drank too much.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.000
So I took you home.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520
Come on.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.720
I've never been drunk since I was so old.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.480
You mean me, right?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.800
Look at me.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.520
Am I drunk

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.120
Am I drunk

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.760
You walk in this way

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.616
Still insisted that you aren’t drunk

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640
Yeah

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.800
Come on, asshole. I'll take you home.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.280
Fine

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880
Door

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200
Door

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.280
Who’ s it?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.280
My God

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.560
What did you

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.240
Oh, that stinks.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.360
How much wine did you get

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:34.790
Yongze

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.030
I’ve delivered you, then I left.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.880
That's the bathroom.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.680
Sorry, I know, l konw

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.480
That's the bedroom

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.600
Where the hell is the door?

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960
Toast

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.200
Let’s go since you recovered
from your drunkenness

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.120
I’m out of wine, broker sister. Out of win

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.400
I amn’t your sister, okay?

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.480
What sisters? brothers?
There's no beer, anyway.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.240
There's no beer. beer ...beer

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.920
Two lunatics.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720
No

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.440
What's he doing bringing
a woman in so late?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.600
Then, should I leave? leave him alone.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040
Cheers

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
Cheers

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.760
Once your real girlfriend knows that

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.399
You're leaving the club because of me.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.840
She’s gonna to be pissed off, right?

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.400
Who? Libao? Don’t mention her

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.280
It’s over between me and her

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.680
I only have a fake girlfriend right now.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.920
That is you

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.440
Well, didn't you leave me to Li Bao?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.800
So you're sad

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.720
Bye

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.080
Wait, I'll give you a ride.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.680
Song chacha

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360
Is anybody here

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
She left yesterday

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.240
Who’s gonna be early in the morning

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.640
Had a drink last

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240
Yongze

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.440
Just drank a little bit. What 's up?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.160
I heard that you’re leaving the club

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.240
Sorry, I didn’t tell you earlier

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.040
But I screwed up the event

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.800
You shouldn't blame Chacha

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.159
She’s important to me

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.400
Since she’s so important to you

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.560
Why’s on valentine’s day that you

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
embarassed her so much

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.920
What about the news between you and Libao

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.880
How can you believe this gossip

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.920
Anyway, I have no defence for that

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.040
Cause I didn’t do it in a right way

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.520
I see

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.840
If

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.360
What if you stay

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.800
Will you stick to your decision

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.240
Don’t you really want to

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.840
Take a fight with me

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160
Tomorrow

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080
Sorry

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.000
Only remember this

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.400
Only remember this

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.680
I really should stop drinking

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920
Cumbersome

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.416
He doesn’t know today’s test

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.200
He won’t come today

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640
Why

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.680
Sorry, I’m late

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.080
Okay, it’s our team testing day

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.040
The test is the 200-meter freestyle

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.480
After this period of hard training

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.200
Though there’s a lot of stuff

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.120
But I also saw your efforts

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.000
Someone try to complain about the coach

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.400
Someone try to play the missing

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.560
Someone try harder to steal wine

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.840
And someone try to look after his wallet

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.560
Anyway

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.080
I hope all of you can get good grades

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.800
For the rest of the time

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.320
It’s our team

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.680
To sent someone to the
national standards contest

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.480
Also, it’s the first test of our team

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.560
Just do what you can

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.920
Bai Yongze 1 "47" 85

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.280
Yongze brother

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.960
You’re the world-class

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.480
LanTian 1 "53" 20

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.760
Guan Jie 1 "56" 30

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:00.920
Jiang Shi

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.680
Coach, forget about mine

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.920
Oaky, then forget it

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.976
When you finished relaxing training

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.240
Come to my office for a meeting

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680
Coach

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040
How

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.280
I can’t attend the meeting

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.400
and I’m not going to play for the team

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.320
Why

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.960
What’s wrong with you

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.560
I promised to take this test before

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.200
So wait until it’s done

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.520
The last valentine’s day

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.160
I caused damage to the resort

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.280
It’s right to leave

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.360
I hope all of you will understand

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.600
You mean, it’s all my fault

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.640
Fine, if you want go, just go away

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.080
Don’t come and left, okay

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.040
Don’t worry

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.840
I won’t let you down

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.440
No, I can’t let you go

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040
You’re a swimmer

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.639
Just because of a commercial event

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.680
Then you’ll leave the team

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.360
It should be the coach if
someone has to be away

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.000
What’s the meaning? Why is me

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.879
For it’s you who make him

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.040
to join the event

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.110
Listen to me, I didn’t do that

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.030
It's up to you to decide
whether to participate or not.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520
Even so

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.520
Lantian, aren’t you Yongze’s best friend

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.680
Try to persuade him

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.240
He won’t listen to me

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.240
he had won

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.760
but he’ll go

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.520
You want us to keep you

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
Do you know how many people
want this opportunity?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.800
Anyway, everybody, take care.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.440
I'll see you later on the court.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160
Yongze brother

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.880
It’s the coach

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Shut up

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.279
I told you, I didn’t recommend it

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.440
So you wanna leave, don’t you

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.000
Coach Huang, I want to know instantly that.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720
Who can play the game

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.840
No matter what, it’s not your turn

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.159
A man who didn't swim in 1 "55"

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.920
isn’t qualified to speak

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
No... He...

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.800
Relax and train

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.159
You quit without telling me

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.640
Are you still taking me as your agent

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.680
And, uh, do I look like a valet?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.880
So ridiculous of you

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.440
It's not funny. It's humiliating.
So humiliating.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.000
What’s wrong with your hair

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.760
You know nothing

00:18:42.761 --> 00:18:44.319
What else can you do besides swimming?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.280
Listen, this is called airport gear.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.200
Only when on the plane

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.720
I have this kind of haircut

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.480
Would you mind paying more attention to me

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.640
And we're not going to the airport.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.800
What about airport gear?

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.200
So, you’re not going home

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.840
Even if you had to go back.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.240
You have to figure out how to go back.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.320
Don't tell my dad about this, please.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.320
Your dad

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.919
Your dad, he wants you to leave.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.960
What about the coach Huang

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.840
Then where are you going?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.040
Let's find a nearby hotel.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.920
What about the hotel money?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240
Of course the broker did.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.720
What’s up

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800
I mean

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.120
Why don't you take charge
of the swimming team?

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.640
Are you proposing to me now?

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.280
Asking... for... marriage

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.640
Don’t you just want to marry me now?

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.160
And then let me be

00:20:08.161 --> 00:20:10.320
the actual hostess of the swimming club.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800
No

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.760
You... You ...understand what I'm saying?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.680
Even if your EQ is low, your IQ is low.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.440
Your understanding is poor

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600
And not to have my words

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600
understood like this.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.040
Why are you so angry

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.600
What the hell are you talking about?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.960
What I'm trying to say is

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.520
Miss, you have no power

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.120
To decide whether Bai
Yongze will stay or not.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.280
Bai Yongze is my man.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.519
Think about it, if

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.599
If I fire your staff,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.600
What would you think?

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.840
I can’t thank you more if you do so

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.439
It happens that our Lingshuiya
is near the Ching Shui Wan

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.690
There's a lot of collaboration
with other big businesses.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.960
I can't do it myself.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.960
You... You're capable.
I'm not talking to you.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.120
Listen to me

00:20:50.121 --> 00:20:52.039
You made me coach, right?

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.039
You can't go beyond your
authority or you'll coach.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.440
Can you teach me how to swim?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.720
Can you be a little reasonable?

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.839
I... I just

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.120
I just did what he asked, okay?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.480
I see

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.120
You wanna to talk to me, don’t you

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.000
All right, take it easy.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.400
I'm still busy.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.720
Wait, are you insane?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.559
Should you go see a doctor?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.839
What do you mean I want to talk to you?

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.360
What do you mean, I want to propose?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.440
Oh, my gosh, I'm having a headache.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200
I am so angry

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.680
I really can't talk to her.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.720
She's such a psycho.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.960
What's all this sudden?

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440
You're leaving.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.920
We can't help giving you a farewell party.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.400
Anyway, thank you.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.640
And thank you, Guanjie.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.760
There's nothing to thank.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.840
Yeah, I'd like a drink, too.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.480
Come on, join us

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.040
Come on

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.800
You don't have to move out so soon.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.600
Staying in the resort

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.999
And no one's gonna kick you out.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.160
Lantian, you don't understand.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.760
Yongze moved out

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.720
is to date Song Chacha more conveniently

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120
What the hell?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
But, before I go

00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:38.920
I do have a place to go

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.080
with Song Chacha

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.040
Anyway, it's all here in Hainan.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.119
We need to find something.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.760
Like Beach villa. Come and live.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.640
So, do it with Song Chacha

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120
Are you through?

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.360
Song chacha

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600
Song chacha

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.320
Why are you suddenly here?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.120
Of course I did.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.199
Isn't it just Yongze

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200
Hurry up

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.760
You were both forced to leave.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.240
Anyway, having a fight with Lantian

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.560
For a final battle.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.360
Let his eyes sparkle.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.640
Come, come, come.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800
Come, come, come

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.280
You two little couples sit together

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560
Sit down

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.680
I'd like to introduce you formally

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.560
This is my girlfriend.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800
Hey, Bai yongze

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.400
How many girlfriends do you have?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.440
The other day, don’t you stay with

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.240
Libao for the valentine’s day

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.000
That story is not true.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.040
I know

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.320
I suggest that we go to KTV later

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480
Good

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.520
Round two, you guys go.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.160
I have something to do

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.640
Wait, wait. You're in charge today.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.920
Where do you want to go

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.760
KTV KTV KTV

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.840
Where are you going? Go

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.360
Song chacha

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.080
Why do you have to turn
around in front of me?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.200
Why don't you stay away from me?

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.440
You go

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.880
The farther the better.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.160
I'm not drunk. Why do you
have to send me back?

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.080
Everyone knows you're my girlfriend.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.240
Haven’t drunk. Okay. bye.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.560
This doesn't fit me.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.320
Bai Yongze's image as a gentleman.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.080
When did the Lantian leave?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.240
I do not know

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.240
The guy left without a word

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.560
I don't think we should
pretend to be a couple.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.320
That's hard for you, too

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.560
And I think I misunderstood Lantian

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.920
He may not have attachment to me anymore.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.840
As for the feelings

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.760
Men don't share it with others.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.000
Once others see it

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.880
They'll feel humiliated.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.120
So, once people are aware of their minds

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.800
And they'll guard against it.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.720
Lan tian might be the same.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720
Anyway

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.720
Bai Yongze, you ‘re singing too bad to hear

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.080
What the hell are you talking about?

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.240
I sing as well as I swim

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.240
which attracts million of girls

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.680
Oh, my God

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.000
You haven't been tuning all night, okay?

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840
Really?

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.160
I think it’s great

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.279
If I don’ t continue swimming

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.400
I’ll be a singer

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.440
You still put aside your
plan to be a singer.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.600
Keep swimming.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760
Go in

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.600
By the way, are you okay?

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.360
It's okay. Guess it's
because of a girlfriend.

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960
Although it's a fake.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520
Song chacha

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.719
Last night, you

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.680
Don't say anything about that.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720
Chacha

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680
Go in

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.880
Right

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.920
It's better to pretend.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.760
What if she remember remembered

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.800
Why bother about this?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.120
What the hell do you want?

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.640
She must have said she was just drunk.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.960
Just be drunk.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.359
Bai Yongze

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.880
Song chacha, She has been afraid
of the dark since she was a child

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.160
She can't sleep at night without it.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.800
Why? why?

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.360
Why commit suicide?

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.159
I said no.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.840
Don’t talk back. I know all about it

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.800
Cause you are leaving the club

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.080
So, you're so sad that
you're gonna kill yourself.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.440
Baiyongze, what's going on with him?

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.920
He tried to kill himself and climbed onto
the street lamp and was electrocuted.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600
What

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.680
Yong ze, are you okay?

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.240
How could that be?

00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:37.320
Suicide, Suicide, Suicide,

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.240
Suicide

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.720
And it's all because of you, Coach.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.480
But for you

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.000
let him join the event like that.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080
Get him out of the club.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.600
How could he possibly kill himself

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640
You useless thing

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.400
How big a thing, you kill yourself.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.600
I said no. That's not true.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.680
I know you're not the
kind of person to die.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.919
What the hell is going on here?

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.136
They said that you climbed up the
streetlight and was electrocuted.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.720
Why climb up the streetlight?

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.560
Yeah, why climb up the street lamp?

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760
See you again.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.400
Looks like your boyfriend's
in the hospital this time.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.440
What boyfriend?

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680
Your boyfriend.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.559
The last time you were hospitalized with
a fever in the middle of the night,

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.600
He's hurt, too.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.079
But he doesn't care.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.400
Come back and forth for you

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.600
You have to take good
care of him this time.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.800
Who come back and forth for me

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.520
You mean the guy in the room?

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.760
Yeah, it's the one called Bai Yongze

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.720
Yongze

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.080
They said that you climbed up the
street lamp and was electrocuted.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.800
Why did you climb up the streetlight?

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.520
Yeah, why did you climb up the street lamp?

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.520
Your boyfriend.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.039
The last time you were hospitalized with
a fever in the middle of the night,

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.240
He's hurt, too.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.400
Song chacha, chacha

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320
Lantian

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.680
Bai Yongze

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.000
What the hell are you doing?

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.000
Have you asked about the
sponsoring company?

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.760
I had a chat about the
difference between big and big.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.560
But we're not sure yet.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.040
What is it? wait, what did you say?

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.880
What? what?

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840
Bai Yongze

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.320
You have sponsorship.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.480
And it's a lot of money.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.640
I'll be right back.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.519
I always pretend to go out with Lantian

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.520
It's not a way.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.559
But Mom's in better shape.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.640
I can't tell her the truth.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.710
Then where am I going?

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.430
Looking for a little sidekick.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040
No, no

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600
what's up?

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.400
You don't miss me?

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.600
You're sick

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.760
It's just a joke.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.670
It's a famous girlfriend, anyway.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.150
Why are you so angry?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.840
Then why are you looking for me?

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:52.360
Let's meet.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120
Great.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.440
Take this

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:11.560
Okay. Okay.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.240
That ring

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.960
I don't know where I lost it.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.440
What’s wrong with Lantian today

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.960
Two seconds late. What happened?

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.720
He is now

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.040
Like a lonely wild goose
that lost his companions.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.240
Lonely geese, what's your mood? I get it.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.440
But, uh, we miss Yongze

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.040
He doesn't care.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.840
The only thing in his heart is Song chacha

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.120
By the way, Yongze is leaving tomorrow.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.880
He might propose to chacha today

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.680
I'm leaving tomorrow, chacha

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.280
So there's something very presumptuous.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.240
I want to ask you once, just once

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.960
Are you coming with me?

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.240
Lantin, sorry

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.079
Lantian, what are you doing?
We’re teammates.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.400
A gentleman will speak with
tongue but not with the tongue

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.040
Lantian, Lantian

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:14.520
What? what's going on like crazy?

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:16.920
Are you all right

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.520
What’s wrong? You surprised me

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.456
You just see through the mirror.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.520
Can't be beautiful, right?

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.960
I

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.640
You look in the mirror and
you're gonna get in there.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.440
The face doesn't work like this.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160
You're perfect, right?

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.256
Sneaking around, peeking at people

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.280
Are you sick?

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.680
Why don't we go get some dinner? come on.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.200
What? all of a sudden.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240
Just in case.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.400
In case that Lantin suddenly pops out,

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.240
We don't look like couple

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.440
Isn't that helping?

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.960
Lantian will be around here today.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.360
Isn't it?

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.800
I mean, in case he's around here,

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.880
Don't make such a joke.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.440
Are you a real pervert?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.080
Come on, I'll take you some delicious food.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760
Miss chacha

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.119
Do you think I’m that kind of person

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.920
who can't afford someone else
to go to a fancy restaurant

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920
Go somewhere else.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.720
I just like to hang out here.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.880
Here are mangoes, oranges, and

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:41.440
It's so fresh.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.360
Do you just smell the scent
and know if it's fresh?

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.200
Of course, if it's fresh,

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.480
Can be sensed by smell.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.200
Smell it

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.280
how

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.160
Do you feel a sweet smell on you

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.040
Nope

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.639
Looks like you're not
just thinking about it.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.640
Not even a nose.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:12.800
Such delicious scent is not to be heard.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.240
What a sin.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.160
Why don't put their soup?

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.840
Because their soup taste bad

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.080
It's monosodium glutamate.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.920
And I like the soup in hotpot

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.959
I'll make one for you

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.960
How about it?
