WEBVTT

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920
Are you new here?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
I am Zhao Yan

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.600
As your senior,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.600
I have to tell you something that

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.720
I won't look out for you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.840
Don't you cry by then

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.030
Understand?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.439
Start cleaning the room

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.000
with the plate

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.000
Your heart is beating?

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.920
It seems like yours

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.480
This is not your first time

00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.639
to show up when I am not

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.760
decent

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
Did you put

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.480
a security camera

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440
on me?

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.840
Because you are always naked in fron of me.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.960
Are you an exhibitionist or something?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.640
I dare you say it again

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
Stop

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.200
You came to my room for no damn reason.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.160
I want an explaination

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960
You are not wroking here?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Yes, I am

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.520
I am a hotel server

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.720
You are so close to collect
garbage on the beach

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.359
please be self-dignified!

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.000
Not everyone can sollect garbage

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600
And

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.840
why do you care whether

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.120
I have dignity or not

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.480
I really don't understand

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.640
why do you stay by him

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:55.360
in this way

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.880
Have you been at rock bottom?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.920
And you have nothing

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.040
To rise to my feet,

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360
so

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.880
I need Lan Tian

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.240
He is your stepping-stone.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.480
Is that what you meant?

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960
Why do you care?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.640
If you can't help me,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040
then leave me alone.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880
And I am warning you,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.280
Don't judge a person's value so easily

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.560
It's my fault

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.400
I did that because I care about you.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.640
Why are you here?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.560
What is this about?

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.720
Your friend Bai Yongze
wangts me to tell you that

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.360
you are just nothing

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.040
in my life

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.840
And it turns out that I am right.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.120
Because I decided to work here.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080
What did you say?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.560
And Lan Tian' room is yours.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.640
What?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.600
Aren't you my sidekick?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.520
Thanks.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
This is just a mistake.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.280
Don't be disgusting.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.920
She said that because...

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.840
I am not talking about her.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.800
Coach Huang and I

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.560
can't let you be yourself.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.080
So I had been speciallly treated.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.080
There is no one who wants take you in

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
To be hoest,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.000
It is Coach Huang that
chooses to take you in.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.560
Not you

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Wait

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.600
Whoever takes me in,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840
I only cooperate when he

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520
gets my aproval

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880
It weren't for you,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600
Coach Huang,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.800
he didn't even get a chance to see me.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.120
And the test?

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.280
You all know what i got.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800
Do I have to be tested?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.840
Well done

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.920
Well done, Song Chacha

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.400
Lan Tian

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320
Lan Tian

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.680
Be honest,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.640
what do you really think

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240
that stands in your way.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.680
So we need to improve this project.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:25.800
That's it

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.280
Let's call it a day

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.150
Everyone, get out.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.840
Is it that hard to

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.880
control yourself?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.080
After all, I am in charge

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040
Frankly,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.040
when do you think I am doing right？

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.359
What's the hurry?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360
What do you want from me?

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520
What is wrong with

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.080
Song Chacha?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.840
She is not a person who
can make her own decision

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720
I want to know

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.320
why she is here.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.760
You are right

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.960
I asked her to come

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.120
I just want her to

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.960
know that not

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.160
everyone in the world

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.799
will abandon her

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
and stay away from her.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.000
I just want to encourage her

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.440
I said I don't have a problem

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.520
with you being CEO

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.920
And it is a deal between father and me

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360
But,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.200
don't get Song Chacha involed in this

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.520
I know

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.000
dad only cares about you.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.360
The reason why I am here is that

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.800
dad is using me

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.280
But I am not a puppet

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.080
I am a CEO

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.880
Don't give me orders

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.960
on managing this resort.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.199
I don't care why you are doing

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200
all this.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.320
Even you try so hard,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.960
Song Chacha is never going back.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.720
Why?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.480
I am not interested in both of you.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.240
I can act like nothing happened

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.200
and forget about her.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.400
But she can't

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:43.960
So

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.336
I am gonna give her enough time

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.520
to forget you

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.960
One satnds on the edge of cliff

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.000
and is going to fall off it.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.280
She deserves my sympathy

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960
He's really changed.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.760
No, you can't do that

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.360
No, you can't do that, Song Chacha

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:26.880
Who is it?

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.999
Lan Tian, I heard you are back.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.240
I'd like to call you.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.040
Do you remember me?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.800
You

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.560
Can you show up

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.280
if I ask

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.320
Did you really see Bai Yongze?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.760
Yes, I did

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.720
What? You mean

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.840
you saw him in person?

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.680
So what?

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.880
Dose he look more handsome than pictures?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.080
He must be handsome.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.840
I didn't see clearly, he
just got out of shower.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.400
Did he...?

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.440
He what?

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.320
You flushed

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
Flushed?

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.440
Why did you run away?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800
Your ears are hot.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.479
So what's really happened?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.720
Come on, come on.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.999
What I said about seeing Bai Yongze

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
is a lie

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.720
I lied, OK?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.160
I knew it.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.039
How could a new guy

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.960
see him?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.279
It' would be so great if

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.720
I can feel

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.920
his swimming suit.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.320
It's said someone went to his room

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.640
and saw him

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.320
with a halo

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.440
Just like,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.960
he doesn't belong here.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.400
Just like an angel falling from above

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.560
I am!

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.240
I must be crazy.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.240
Let's get started.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.360
This is today's training
except Bai Yongze's.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840
Cumbersome

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.400
Here is your training program

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600
Do it yourself

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.400
Seriously?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.040
I don't have that time.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.320
This is not my first time

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.480
and you told me last time that

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.840
I can start next phase training.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.840
Are you kiddding?

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.440
Ridiculous, I am the coach

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680
I am telling you that

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.120
I only focus on those who listen to me.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.240
You are not one of them.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.839
But it depends on yourself.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.880
I doubt your ability.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.200
How?

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.840
Let's make a bet.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.440
You?

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.320
Pontoon?

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.960
200m free style

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.680
The fastest one wins.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.080
Bum-boy, what if you lose?

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.080
You do what I say.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.320
Deal.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.200
Come on

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.760
Come on.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
Why

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.719
did Coach Huang do that?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.720
200m free style

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.280
He is asking for trouble.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720
Shut up.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.399
Yong Ze's explosiveness

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.640
is extraodinary.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.720
If he keeps it,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.040
Coach Huang is never gonna win.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.680
No one is able to continue this way.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.400
He swam so hard in the first half

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.560
I bet he

00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:57.200
will be tired in the last half.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.350
Come on

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.760
Come, coach

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.479
Come on, come on.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.880
Come on

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.960
Come on

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960
Yong Ze come on

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.680
Coach Huang wins!!

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.880
Yes.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360
What's wrong with him?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.960
Yong Ze, are you Ok?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.240
What happened?

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.360
I don't know.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.160
Something is wrong?

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.200
Yong Ze, what's wrong with you?

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.440
Where are you going?

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.400
What is wrong?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.440
I don't know.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.160
You ok, coach?

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.880
You sure you don't do to the hospital?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.199
Foeget it, I am ok.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.880
No need to.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.320
You have to go to the hospital.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.720
You have to

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.120
Sir, if your condition is aggravated

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.200
if your condition is aggravated

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.400
you have to let me know

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.080
Got it, buddy

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.159
I gotta get my

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.160
three-month payment

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.480
I know it, go go

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960
go, both of you

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.760
These cold-blood guys

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.200
So ungrateful

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.080
I just threw the car into reverse

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.200
I didn't see this coming.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.520
How how is he?

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.160
The patient can't stand right now.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.880
I think he should be observed in hospital.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.840
I just threw the car into reverse

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.320
Are you picking me up?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.120
I was going to the airport.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880
But

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.960
I couldn't remember your face.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.240
So do you remember now?

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800
What the hell?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.400
So annoying!

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.279
I didn't expect such

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.760
a warm welcome.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080
Not bad.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.880
Oh gosh, is that Song Chacha?

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.000
Did you just break up?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.160
Yes, we did.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760
Then why is she here?

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.880
Is she stalking you.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.080
I am so sorry

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.760
to let you see something you shouldn't.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.800
Since you saw it

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.479
Forget about those hypocritical

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.880
greetings and concern.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.119
I just want to buy you a coffee

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.320
as condolence.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.840
But I have a date with Lan Tian.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:02.920
So,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.920
Song Chacha

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360
Finally.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.936
I have been waiting for you, like, forever

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960
What the hell?

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.640
Isn't this Lan Tian?

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.640
Let's go!

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.720
Want some water?

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.920
I am not in that mood.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.520
Can't you just pretend to see nothing?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.880
You were standing there like a fool.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.480
How could I pretend to see nothing?

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.360
You are the one

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.800
who prentended to see nothing

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.999
Why were you standing there, pathetic?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.480
You what pathetic is?

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.640
Pathetic is when you are too embarrassed

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.520
to let people find out but get found out

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.360
by someone who shouldn't.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.240
What the hell are you talking about?

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.560
My comfort is worth nothing?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.680
I am so sorry.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.960
It's OK to be embarrassed
in front of Lan Tian.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.639
It's not OK to be
embarrassed in front of me.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.800
Don't you understand?

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.879
I just don't want people to find out

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.440
what I look like when I look like shit.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.920
This is my business.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.160
What do you really want,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.400
Song Chacha?

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.920
What is it you truely desire?

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.160
Revenge?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.040
Or wanting him back?

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.279
Why are we at the aiport?

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.040
I have booked you a ticket to Beijing

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640
You can walk yourself in.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.239
Are you playing me?

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.600
I thought

00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:16.280
you prepared well to be here.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Isn't it?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.400
I bought you a first-class ticket

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.240
as freight of refund

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.560
I have been nice to you.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920
What do you want?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920
Scumbag

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.880
You heard that?

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.600
Song Chacha

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.520
I am scumbag

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.320
So

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.720
It only hurts to stay near me.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.560
That's all you got

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.120
What? You quit?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.440
What happened?

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.080
Why did you just quit?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.480
What about me if you are gone?

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.656
What's my dimission concerned about you?

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.800
It is concerned.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.320
We are colleagues

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.640
Don't you know?

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.080
Besides comrades-in-arms

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.960
colleague friendship is

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.880
the firmest.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.200
Song Chacha

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.200
Ten minutes

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280
Wait outside.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.080
What happened?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920
I quit

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.080
Because?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440
It's personal.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.440
Personal?

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520
Got it.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640
Then

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.200
Zhao Yan will resign with you.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.360
Manager, I don't want to resign.

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.920
I really never thoght about that.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.600
I just take it as you are ready to leave

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.720
She wants to leave, not me.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.960
It's personal.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.080
OK?

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.839
I don't think it's reasonable

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.800
So you walked in and said
you want a resignation.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.040
Is that reasonable?

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.016
There has not been a casual
worker who dares to want

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.480
a resignation since I worked here.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.640
Who the hell are you?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.440
Is it great to go through the backdoor?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880
I am sorry,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
manager.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.240
I worked hard to get this job.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.480
I can't leave before my dream comes true.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.000
I can't, I just can't, manager.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.320
Just think

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.320
it's not your lucky day.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.440
Manager

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.600
Out.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.120
She won't leave with me

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.800
as long as I don't resign, right?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560
Cha Cha

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.520
Even so,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.280
I can't pretend nothing happened.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.640
Go and make an inventory of
equipment and materials;

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.400
,take that as your punishment.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.600
Get it done, today.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.000
How dare you ignore me.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.640
I will show you what I got.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480
I am so sorry.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Because of me

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.560
That's fine

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.720
You said

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.280
our colleague friendship
is the firmest one.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.120
Your dream almost shattered

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.760
because of me.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.200
Don't worry,

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.520
I never forget you

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.480
if my dream comes true.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.800
Who knows?

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.560
If I am the wife of the owner,

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.800
I will fire him first.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.080
And I'll let you be the manager.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.360
Is getting amrried to Lan Tian

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.319
your dream?

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320
Of course

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.160
You know what?

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.720
I have a dream

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.320
What is it?

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.000
Getting married to a good man.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.280
Why do you bet your life on a man?

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.760
It's not a dream.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.200
It's gambling.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840
Anyway,

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.640
just wait there, Lan Tian.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.840
I will bring him down

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.160
with my stunning beauty.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.080
But what is your dream?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.280
Dream?

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.000
What is dream?

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.400
It's something that can fill in your heart.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:33.840
Everybody, think.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.280
Do you have a dream?

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.600
Do you?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.080
It's that urge

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.160
To be the winner.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.680
It's so close to our test day.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.120
Ask yourself,

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.560
where is your heart?

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.280
Did you put everything

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.000
into swimming?

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.840
Did you?

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.080
Lan Tian

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.800
Are you listening to me?

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.600
My dream

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.639
is to be the best swimming player

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.440
in this world.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.280
That's my brother.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:30.680
What about you?

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.200
What's your dream, Lan Tian?

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.479
Then I to be the best swimming player

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.880
in this world, too.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.920
You have the same dream!

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.640
No

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.400
I am the only one of the best
swimming player in this world

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.280
That's not gonna happen.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.890
I want to be the best swimming
player in this world, too.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.000
If I win, I am the best.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.840
Deal.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:53.280
OK

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.720
Since you all have your dream.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Think about

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.040
who is the one you want to defeat.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680
Bai Yongze

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.680
Who is it?

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.760
I am asking you, Bai Yongze.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.280
What kind of athlete do you want to be?

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.120
You are born to swim.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.960
You will shine wherever you go.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.400
Coach didn't defeat you.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.640
You are defeated by yourself.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280
But

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.000
you won't admit it now.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.080
Faster

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400
Faster

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600
Think about your dream.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.560
Run.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.600
What kind of athlete do you want to be?

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:44.880
Just someone?

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.560
Ha~

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.120
The kind of kissing girls.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880
Kidding?

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160
Or provoking?

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240
What do you think it is?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960
If it's provoking?

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480
I don't have that time.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.160
Just take it as provoking?

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.640
I just have a problem with you today.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.760
Just wanna have a fight.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.920
That's what I am thinking.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.680
You are a real eye-opener today.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.640
Which one is the real Lan Tian?

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.680
Both of you

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880
what are you doing?

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:27.840
Forget it

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.920
Hey, stop

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.280
You have strengh to fight?

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.440
I am warning you

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.560
If I see you fighting again,

00:33:35.561 --> 00:33:36.881
you will be banned from swimming.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080
That's it.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.896
Training on the land is over.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.160
Let's go back to the natatorium

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440
Yes

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120
He's not...

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.230
He's not...

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.440
He was out of hospital this morning

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.120
Can he walk?

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.150
Doc says he is fine and releases him.

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.360
I know that.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.880
Tears almost stained my face

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.320
Is it really necessary to come froward?

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.759
I am the CEO of this resort

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.880
with manners and high status.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240
I have to.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.960
And I have to do it in person.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360
Damn it!

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.480
Who are you,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720
please?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:00.840
Why...

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.680
are you taking off your pants?

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.560
What the hell are you going to do?

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.440
I am sewing my pants in my room?

00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:08.080
Why do you care?

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.719
The problem is not whose room this is,

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.400
is you not wearing your pants.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.920
Pervert

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240
Psychopath

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.480
You are still busy with this?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.640
Let's get out of here!

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.560
But

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.840
I haven't finished this.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.920
We wiil do that later.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.360
Manager is askng for us

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:31.800
Let's go!

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.120
You...

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680
Come on, come on

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.160
Are you sure the manager
wants us to be here?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.920
He told us to leave

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.040
when we cleaned that up.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120
What..?

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.720
Destiny is on own hands.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.680
Hey, look!

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.800
Love love love fall in love love love

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.160
fall in love love love

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.840
fall in love love love

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600
What should I do?

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.480
He is looking at me.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880
Song Chacha

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.680
Is that not hurting enough?

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.400
Why are you still here?

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.279
Fall in love love love

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.320
just fall in love

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.320
the scene that I saw you

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.720
she remembers all

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.080
let every colour

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:49.880
Shit, you scared.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:51.960
I already

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.960
see through you.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
What?

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.960
Do you want

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.720
my number?

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.840
Who the hell are you?

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880
Step away!

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:07.680
You look so cute

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.120
when you piss off

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240
What about

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.760
having a drink

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760
with me later?

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.400
Do you get along well with Bai Yongze?

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520
Absolutely!

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.440
We are good friends!

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
Seriously?

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240
I feel embarassed if

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.760
we have dinner

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.960
together

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.760
Just... you know

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:34.760
That's awkward!

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920
What about

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.560
you asking both of them out

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.120
Fine!

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.160
Then, tonight

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.640
at the bar at the crossing.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.480
Sure!

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.160
See you!

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.520
See you!

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.040
Bye!

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160
Bye!

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.320
This idiot

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.680
is just perfect for Song Chacha.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:06.840
What?

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.880
Lan Tian told you to meet at the bar.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.280
Lan... Tian?

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.040
Lan Tian...

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.319
Yong Ze ask tou

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.360
to meet at the bar.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.800
Well, I sent the message

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200
and I am gonna leave.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.480
We are finished if you lie again.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.800
The manager did say that we can leave

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.680
we can leave

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.599
after cleaning the pool

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.760
and organising the inventory.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.480
How dare you say that!

00:40:11.481 --> 00:40:12.721
Can you jsut sacrifice yourself

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.040
for me?

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.600
If I were the owner,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.000
I could give you a position

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.760
larger than manager.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.720
No!

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.280
I buy you some drinks

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:26.880
as my apology.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.480
Song Chacha!

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.720
Song Chacha!

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.320
What the fuck!

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.520
You asked me out?

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.680
You asked me out!

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040
Shit!

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:21.960
Jiang Shi!

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.080
I changed into my cool clothes.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200
So

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.480
I am late.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.920
What tricks are you playing?

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.680
I just want to ask teamates
out for some drinks.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.680
This is quite a good place!

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.920
Perfect

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:45.840
Waiter

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.120
Three packs of beer

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.200
Make them full!

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.320
Don't you know

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.560
we can't take in alcohol
because of training?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:56.080
Well

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.680
Three glasses of beer without alcohol.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.680
We should finish our work.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.960
And then have a drink.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.120
We will be more efficient

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.680
after a drink.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.800
Then just have a liitle and we will leave.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.160
Only if something miracle happened,

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.760
after a drink.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.520
What are you saying?

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360
I remembered.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.200
There is a place that can changes my fate.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.400
What are you talking about?

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.440
Just go, go

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.440
Cheers!

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.800
Hey angels!

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Come here!
